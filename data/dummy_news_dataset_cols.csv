3883,4423,Remembering Apollo 1: NASA’s Careless Mistake That Killed Three Courageous Men,"Space exploration is an intriguing and necessary science, but sometimes it comes at a true cost. It’s been 50 years since the crash of Apollo 1 but it has by no means been forgotten.

The crash of Apollo one was heart-wrenching and perhaps one of the most frustrating because it was purely the fault of NASA employees. It might even be the most embarrassing failure they’ve ever experienced. On January 27, 1967, three men were preparing for the first manned Apollo flight when the disaster occurred. There were congressional hearings, stalled missions, and a thorough investigation after the incident occurred.

After boarding the rocket, the command module burst into a rapid fire during a launch rehearsal test. All three of the men died inside. Families mourned as NASA announced what had happened to Roger Chaffee, Virgil ‘Gus’ Grissom, and Ed White II. “To me, it’s an emotional thing,” said Bill Barry, NASA’s chief historian, who was 9 years old when the fire occurred. “Because space is risky and dangerous and it’s hard to do and can be expensive. But ultimately, you want to do it in a way that you don’t hurt anybody, and everybody comes home alive. This is a reminder that you have to be on your toes, and make sure that happens.”

It was approximately 6:31 PM when the astronauts began screaming that they had a fire in the cockpit. You can hear the cries in a recording. According to the official NASA summary, a command module ruptured, bursting gas and flames from the command center. Ground control took about five minutes to get the door to the hatch open but they could hardly see anything. One Washington Post story from 1967 stated that the inside looked like a furnace. The crew officially died from suffocating from the fires toxic gases and thermal burns. The associated press reported that ‘it was over for them in seconds.’

“I heard their screaming voices in the cockpit of the spacecraft. I heard them scream that they were on fire. I heard them scream get me out of here. And then there was dead silence on the pad. Within minutes we knew they were dead, and we were in deep, serious trouble,” The flight director, Chris Kraft reported.

This was truly a disaster and we must forever respect those three brave men. The first men to be courageous enough to volunteer as the first people going to the moon. Never forget America!

248,287,UK: Sharia-compliant Islamic school’s toilet paper jihad,"Muslim girls’ school in the UK has received the lowest Ofsted rating available after inspectors discovered that pupils were not provided with toilet paper for Islamic “cultural reasons.”

UK Telegraph (h/t TROP Staff at the Park Avenue Girls’ High School, in Stoke-on-Trent, said paper was available from the school office, but because most of the students were Muslim, they preferred to wash rather than wipe.

The Ofsted report stated: “At the time of the inspection, it was not the school’s common practice to provide soap for pupils’ hand-washing, toilet roll in the toilets or suitable drinking water.

“Toilet paper is available from the school office when pupils request it. Pupils told inspectors that they sometimes avoided using toilets for the whole school day because of this.” But headteacher Abdul Ghafoor Salloo defended the policy, insisting the school catered for the cultural needs of the pupils.

“The children they do use the toilets and traditionally, because we are Muslim, we wash, not only wipe. There are facilities for pupils to clean themselves,” he said. It might be hard for someone who doesn’t traditionally wash to understand and washing is better than wiping clean. “The Ofsted inspector said there has to be toilet rolls, we said there are always toilet rolls but they are not always out – so what?”

DALLAS — For a century carmakers built the cars and trucks their customers wanted. That’s changing. Increasingly they’re building cars and trucks the government wants their customers to have—and that means electric vehicles (EVs).

CNN reports that China, France, Great Britain, India, Norway and Germany are considering banning the future production and sale of gasoline and diesel-powered engines.

DALLAS — Taxing carbon emissions has long been supported by environmentalists and the political left, but recently it has found support among some establishment Republicans. And perhaps even President Donald Trump.

Taxing carbon raises the price of using energy. Supporters hope the country would, therefore, emit less carbon, reducing our impact on climate change. However, they are ignoring several problems.

There is no viable alternative to carbon-based fuels. In economics the “elasticity of demand” is the idea that if the price of one product such as coffee goes up significantly, consumers will look for substitutes, perhaps tea.

A product is considered “elastic” when there are lots of substitutes and “inelastic” when there aren’t.

DALLAS, Texas—It was probably too good to last—that Americans of all economic classes, backgrounds and political persuasions could briefly escape these hyper-political times and watch a sporting event.

Colin Kaepernick, a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, may have changed all of that.

He’s not the first to infuse politics into sports. At the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, for example, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, the 200-meter race gold and bronze winners, were expelled after holding up black-gloved fists at their award presentation during the playing of the national anthem.

DALLAS, Texas—In his speech to the Democratic National Convention, Khizr Kahn, the father of a fallen American Muslim soldier, held up a pocket-sized copy of the U.S. Constitution and rhetorically asked Donald Trump, “Have you even read the United States Constitution?”

It’s a good question—for all Americans. Because those who read it will find nothing giving the federal government the authority to manage national bathroom policy.

In fact, as readers reach the end of the Bill of Rights they will discover the Tenth Amendment, which says: “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”

DALLAS, Texas—California has joined only four other states allowing physicians to write lethal prescriptions that dying patients can administer to themselves. Oregon was the first, blazing that trail in 1997. But with only five state “victories” in nearly 20 years, you can’t really call physician-assisted suicide legislation a trend.

May 14, 2015 — Merrill Matthews

DALLAS, Texas—Did you notice how President Obama misinformed, and even misled, the country about certain aspects of his health care law—which imposed significant burdens on millions of Americans?

Well, ditto for his mandate requiring cars, light trucks and SUVs to meet a 54.5 miles per gallon (mpg) standard by 2025.

DALLAS, Texas—Who’s the best person to lead a “witch-hunt”? A witch, of course.

Keep that in mind when you hear progressive members of Congress claiming they are investigating whether research grants have influenced the views of several well-respected environmental scientists. Because in the public’s mind the people most likely to sell their opinions to the highest bidder aren’t scientists but … politicians.

DALLAS, Texas—The U.S. Supreme Court will hear the second biggest legal challenge to President Obama’s Affordable Care Act (ACA), or Obamacare, on March 4. A decision for the plaintiffs in King vs. Burwell won’t kill the law, but it could make it largely unworkable in 37 states.

DALLAS, Texas—The Obama Administration is mandating that each automaker’s line-up of cars, light trucks and SUVs have an average fuel economy of 54.5 miles per gallon (MPG) by 2025.

Like so many of the administration’s reforms, this one is imposed by executive fiat rather than approved by Congress—and the incoming Republican Congress should try to roll it back.",http://canadafreepress.com/members/1/MerrillMatthews/992,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
836,948,The news that has Abortion Inc. in fear,"A special report from pro-life activists at Operation Rescue confirms the abortion industry across America is continuing to decline, with only about 23 percent of the surgical abortion facilities that were doing abortion procedures in 1991 still open.

It’s happening just as it’s been confirmed that the FBI is investigating Planned Parenthood and other industry leaders for their trade in the body part of unborn children.

The investigation resulted from recommendations of committees in both houses of Congress based on a series of 2015 undercover videos showing abortion business executives talking about higher prices for baby body parts. One famously said she wanted higher prices because, “I want a Lamborghini.”

And it’s coming just as America’s economy is booming under President Trump, with the Dow up 5,000 in a year and corporations such as AT&T announcing massive employee bonus programs in response to the new tax-reform bill.

The new report is the latest in a series that dates back to 2009, when Operation Rescue started keeping tabs on the abortion industry.

OR’s Cheryl Sullenger said earlier this year the number of abortion facilities dropped by 27 across America.

“Closures far outpaced newly opened abortion facilities in 2017. In all, 49 abortion facilities – 35 surgical and 14 medication only clinics – closed or halted abortion services. Only eight new surgical abortion facilities were opened, along with 11 new medication abortion facilities,” she said.

Read the tested and proven strategies to defeat the abortion cartel, in “Abortion Free: Your Manual for Building a Pro-Life America One Community at a Time.”

“There was also some movement between categories. Fourteen surgical abortion facilities now only conduct medication abortions, while five medication abortion facilities added surgical abortions.

“These encouraging statistics and more were verified through an annual survey of abortion facilities conducted by Operation Rescue staff, this year with the assistance of Abortion Free New Mexico,” her report said.

“Operation Rescue’s annual surveys provide the most complete and accurate picture of abortion facilities available – straight from the horse’s mouth,” said Troy Newman, president of Operation Rescue.

He also was a founding member of the board of the Center for Medical Progress, which did the undercover videos. CMP continues fighting in court for the right to provide all of its information to the public.

The report said each facility was contacted directly, with abortionists providing the information about the availability of abortion, the prices and more.

“In 2017, there are 704 abortion facilities remaining in the U.S. Of these, 490 offer surgical abortions, often along with medication abortions. There are 214 facilities that offer only medication abortions,” the report said. “Forty-five percent of all states had at least one abortion facility that closed or halted all abortion services this year.

“Surgical abortion clinics decreased in number by 26 percent since 2009, the first year Operation Rescue began keeping records. Overall, there has been a 17 percent decrease in the total number of abortion facilities in America since 2009. Since 1991, when there were 2,176 active surgical abortion facilities, only 23 percent of that number of surgical clinics are operating today.”

The so-called “pill mills,” which offer abortions through drugs only, held steady form in 2016.

“Planned Parenthood reduced its number of abortion facilities by consolidating services into fewer locations. In 2016, Planned Parenthood operated 354 facilities that conducted abortions. Today, there are a total of 347 Planned Parenthood facilities that offer abortions. Of those, 160 are surgical abortion facilities, and 187 provide only medication abortions,” the report said.

Planned Parenthood now accounts for just under half of all abortion facilities in the nation.

Some of the facilities that reopened were in Texas, where a law had mandated their closure. However, the U.S. Supreme Court, which created the right to abortion in the 1973 Roe v. Wade case, canceled some of the restrictions Texans had adopted.

However, 17 of the original 20 abortion businesses that had closed remain closed, the report said.

Among the notable closures was one in Maryland run by late-term abortionist LeRoy Carhart, Robert Santella’s business in San Diego, California, and a Planned Parenthood in Silver Spring, Maryland.

Earlier, the FBI’s assistant director of the Office of Congressional Affairs, Gregory Brower, told the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, the FBI received the committee’s criminal referrals of Planned Parenthood and is reviewing its recommendations, according to the nonprofit legal group Liberty Counsel.

Liberty Counsel is representing one of the undercover videographers, Sandra Merritt, who captured Planned Parenthood executives talking about the trade.

The letter to Grassley was delivered during the summer but was never publicized by the Judiciary Committee, Liberty Counsel said.

“We can confirm the Criminal Investigative Division (CID) of FBI Headquarters received your referrals and sent them to the relevant FBI field offices for review,” the letter said, “and whatever action that is deemed appropriate. Should the field offices have any questions pertaining to findings with the Majority Staff Report, they will be certain to contact your office.”

Liberty Counsel noted the Senate Judiciary Committee and the U.S. House Select Panel on Infant Lives both opened investigations into the abortion industry after the Center for Medical Progress first exposed the baby-body-parts trade in 2015. Late last year, both committees concluded their investigations by recommending that the FBI investigate and potentially file criminal charges against Planned Parenthood.

One of the videos showed an official admitting Planned Parenthood sells fully intact aborted babies.

Crushing babies

In the first undercover video released by CMP, Deborah Nucatola of Planned Parenthood commented on crushing babies.

“We’ve been very good at getting heart, lung, liver, because we know that, so I’m not gonna crush that part, I’m gonna basically crush below, I’m gonna crush above, and I’m gonna see if I can get it all intact,” she said.

See the first video:

In the second video, Planned Parenthood’s Mary Gatter discussed how her compensation for organs could rise when she said, “I want a Lamborghini.”

See her comments:

The fifth video released shows Melissa Farrell of Planned Parenthood’s Houston clinic discussing “intact fetal cadavers.”

The seventh video has the testimony of a Planned Parenthood worker who tapped an aborted infant’s heart and saw it start beating.

WND reported when a Planned Parenthood-linked judge in California, William Orrick III, censored the latest undercover video that was released. His presence in the case now has been challenged as unethical.

Even news outlets not party to the case were barred from posting the video.

WND, however, transcribed for its readers the comments of the abortion-industry figures.

Lisa Harris, medical director for Planned Parenthood of Michigan, says in the video: “Our stories don’t really have a place in a lot of pro-choice discourse and rhetoric, right? The heads that get stuck that we can’t get out. The hemorrhages that we manage.”

Susan Robinson of Planned Parenthood of Mar Monte in San Jose, California: “The fetus is a tough little object and taking it apart, I mean taking it apart, on day one is very difficult.’

Talcott Camp, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Reproductive Health Freedom Project: “I’m like oh my god! I get it! When the skull is broken, that’s really sharp. I get it, I understand why people are talking about getting that skull out, that calvarium.”

Deborah Nucatola, senior director of medical services at Planned Parenthood Federation of America: “You know, sometimes she’ll tell me she wants brain, and we’ll, you know, leave the calvarium in ’til last, and then try to basically take it, or actually, you know, catch everything, and even keep it separate from the rest of the tissue so it doesn’t get lost.”

Uta Landy, founder of the Consortium of Abortion providers for Planned Parenthood: “An eyeball just fell down into my lap, and that is gross.”

Her comment was followed by raucous laughter from the abortionists at the meeting of the National Abortion Federation, where the undercover video was taken.

The video was the work of the Center for Medical Progress, which since 2015 has released more than a dozen videos of abortionists. Most of the videos have been released to the public, but the National Abortion Federation went to court demanding that videos of its members speaking be removed from the Web.

There were other notable comments in the videos.

Ann Schutt-Aine of Planned Parenthood of the Gulf Coast: “If I’m doing a procedure, and I’m seeing that I’m in fear that it’s about to come to the umbilicus, I might ask for a second set of forceps to hold the body at the cervix, and pull off a leg, or two, so it’s not PBA (partial-birth abortion).”

Harris again: “Given that we actually see the fetus the same, and given that we might actually both agree that there’s violence in here, ask me why I come to work every day. Let’s just give them all the violence, it’s a person, it’s killing, let’s just give them all that.”

Susan Robinson of Planned Parenthood Mar Monte: “You go in there, and you go, ‘am I getting the uterus, or the fetus? Oh good fetus. What have I got. Nothing. Let’s try again.'”

Leslie Drummond of Planned Parenthood Mar Monte: “I get a lot of ‘oohs’ and aahs’ from Stemex(press) you know, they’re wanting livers. Last week I was in Sacramento and she said, ‘I need four intact limbs’ and I said ‘you want what?'”

Paul Blumenthal, Planned Parenthood of Maryland: “I know Planned Parenthood sells a lot of stuff (fetal organs) to people.”

Deb Vanderhei of the Consortium of Abortion Providers: “But the truth is that some might want to do it for, to increase their revenues. And we can’t stop them.”

1925,2199,Legislature Apparently Not An Assemblage of Total Asshats,"The Utah legislature proved they are not a complete waste of public funding nor a totally ineffectual legislative body yesterday after approving an anti-discrimination bill that offers basic rights and protections to LGBT persons.

More than the passage of the bill, which guarantees individuals in the community are treated as people instead of subhuman, citizens and politicians alike stood all amazed that Utah’s notoriously misguided consortium of goons managed to focus on and pass a meaningful piece of legislation.

“It shows a remarkable amount of maturity and being in touch with humanity that I’m not used to seeing with that group of knuckleheads up on the Hill,” said one citizen. “Say, you think we can get Elder Dallin H. Oaks to back the medical marijuana bill next year?”

“Wait, we’re up here promoting civility and decency in our state instead of the defunding of education or nonsensical alcohol laws?” said one befuddled lawmaker. “I gotta say, this new apprehension of civic responsibility is something new and different from us, your elected officials.”

The bill may be a victory for the LGBT community, but it is also being viewed skeptically for its religious exemptions, which still allows Church-influenced operations–and in some cases individual exemptions–to discriminate on religious grounds.

“I think it’s great,” said an LDS bishop who preferred to remain anonymous. “I was worried at first, but turns out I can continue to instill feelings of isolation and guilt in the same-sex-attraction-challenged members of my flock without fear of recrimination from the law, and I still don’t have to marry any of them. So it’s win-win if you ask me.”

At press time, state lawmakers regressed to their old ways and scheduled a forum discussion on possible laws prohibiting anal sex in public restrooms for next year’s legislative session.",http://beehivebugle.com/2015/03/13/state-legislature-apparently-not-an-assemblage-of-total-asshats/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
2222,2544,12 Warning Signs You Are Headed For a Sexless Marriage,"Experts reveal that the average American loses their virginity at the age of 17, stepping into the highly sexualized world that we accept in our country today. With Hollywood and television opening the door to comfortable conversations about sexual topics, and an increased acceptance of one-night stands and casual hookups among unmarried partners, it is not surprising that we view ourselves as a highly sexual culture, placing an importance on that area of our relationships.

This can be seen in the fact that only 27% of Americans believe that true love can exist without an active sex life. If we genuinely place such a high importance on the topic of sex in our relationships, why then do we crack jokes about the stereotype that sex ends the second that we say ‘I Do?’ What is it about marriage that we believe can negate this need for an active sex life? Believe it or not, you can maintain a healthy sex life after exchanging vows, however, both partners need to be willing to make an active effort. Knowing and understanding the signs that this is starting to slip will empower you to take the steps necessary to protect this important area of your life.

Watch for these 12 signs that you are headed for a sexless marriage:

#1 – You Stop Flirting

The first sign for many couples that they are starting to head down the path towards a sexless marriage is the moment when they realize that they are no longer flirting with their spouse. The act of flirting is an important part of foreplay, creating desire and anticipation so that when the time is right for a little sexy time together, both partners are excited and ‘into’ the moment. If you notice that you are acting more like friends than lovers, losing that sexual spark, then you need to make an active effort to reintroduce it into your relationship. Actively make an effort to flirt with your spouse, showing them that they do still desire them in that way.

#2 – You Fill Your Schedules with Activities that Keep You Apart

With the demands of work, hobbies, and friends, it is not uncommon for couples to find themselves headed in separate directions, spending much of their time apart. It is important to note, however, that it is quality time spent together that will provide you with the time necessary to maintain a sexual relationship, providing for the opportunity to share in fun, intimacy, pleasure and a sexual connection. If you feel as though either of you is overloading their schedule in an attempt to avoid this time together, this is the sign that something is going downhill, fast.

#3 – You Rarely Touch One Another

Whether you are in the bedroom, sharing a bed, or moving about your daily lives you no longer share those little moments of physical contact. For example, you no longer kiss one another goodbye, cuddle, give back rubs or even hold one another’s hands. This physical distance is representative of something much bigger – an emotional and romantic divide that has developed between you. These little moments are extremely important in a relationship. If you notice that you are starting to slip, make a conscious effort to try to add these moments back into your daily routine.

#4 – You Feel Like Friends or Roommates Rather Than Lovers

As we spend more time living with one another we may fall into the trap of becoming ‘too comfortable’ with one another. Rather than taking the time to look good for one another, we spend our time wearing our comfortable ‘around the house’ clothes, and we may even wait a little longer between showers unconcerned if we don’t quite look our best. If you are looking to add a little extra spark to your relationship, take the time to put on your favorite lingerie or style your hair in a new way.

#5 – Your Self Image is Suffering

If you or your partner have hit a point in your lives where you question your own self-worth, struggling with issues of self-confidence or body image, this is a contributing factor to the break down of sex in a relationship. If you aren’t feeling attractive, or if your partner is not making you feel attractive or wanted, this can have a negative impact on your desire to engage in sexual activities. To help avoid this occurring in your relationship, both partners should make an active effort to show their partner that they are viewed as attractive and sexy.

#6 – You Avoid Watching Sex Scenes on TV Together

If, when a sex scene comes on the television you find yourselves awkwardly making an excuse to leave the room or changing the channel this may be an indication of a bigger problem. Sex scenes, for a couple sharing a healthy sexual relationship, can inspire a couple, providing them with ideas of things that they would like to try or introducing new fetishes or dynamics into the relationship. For those who are struggling, this is a reminder of an awkward or difficult area in their lives.

#7 – You Avoid Going to Bed at the Same Time

Your bed is an important space for a couple, the one place in the home where you are regularly in close quarters, often associated not only with sleep but also with cuddling and sexual experiences. If you, as a couple, are not in a good place sexually then you may want to avoid the awkward moment of sharing a bed together. This includes any conversation centered around whether you will or will not engage in sexual activity. Rather than coming up with excuses like ‘I’m tired’ or ‘I’m just not feeling well,’ it may be easier to just avoid going to bed until after your partner has fallen asleep.

#8 – You Withhold Sex as a Punishment

Rather than viewing sex as an important and fundamental part of your relationship, you perceive it as a reward that you can choose to give to your partner when it is in your best interest. This power struggle creates an incredibly negative energy surrounding the idea of sex, creating resentment and hurt feelings. If sex is seen in your relationship as a negative experience, then it only makes sense that it is an area of your life that is struggling. Never withhold sex as a form of punishment, as it should not be viewed as something you can lord over your spouse.

#9 – You Fail to Communicate About Sex

Communication is key to a healthy relationship, and this means every topic and area of your lives together. If you are unable to openly discuss sex with one another, then you are hindering your ability to have a happy and fulfilled sex life. By discussing what you like, what you don’t like, your fantasies, favorite positions, etc. couples are able to tailor their sexual experience to be better for both parties. Failure to do so may leave one or both lacking the satisfaction that you required in order to be interested in maintaining an ongoing sexual relationship.

#10 – Your Partner Makes Fun of Your Sex Drive

As we are all individuals, all couples will have their own unique sex drives. For this reason, it is incredibly common among couples for these sex drives not to match up entirely. If you are feeling judged or attacked by your partner for your personal sex drive, whether it is because you have a higher drive than they share, or one that is significantly lower, this erodes the trust and respect in the relationship. Driving a wedge between the couple, it will not only kill your sex life, but it may cause big problems in your relationship as a whole.

#11 – You Have Unrealistic Expectations of Sex

With the open portrayal of sex and sexual encounters on television and in the movies, children grow up with an artificial idea of what sex actually is. This can often lead to unreasonable and unrealistic expectations including the belief that it will always go smoothly and that both people will always reach orgasm. As this expectation is rooted in a false betrayal, it sets you up for disappointment and upset when these expectations are not met. It’s important to note that every sexual experience is going to be different. In order to enjoy a healthy and fulfilling sex life you must both go into it with an open mind.

#12 – You’re Making Life All About the Kids

When children come into your life it can turn your entire life on its head, moving you into a new chapter of your life. Be cautious that you don’t allow the children to take over your entire life, leaving your relationship in the dust. Instead, be sure to carve out time for you and your spouse. Go out on dates, spend time alone with one another and continue to put the effort into romancing your partner. Even the smallest of efforts can go a long way to keeping that spark alive.

2874,3294,Dead Sea Scrolls Deciphered: One of the Last Known Scrolls Reconstructed (Video),"Scholars examining the Dead Sea Scroll fragments. (Public Domain)

Written in Three Different Languages

Dr. Ratzon explained that it took decades that involved many scientists and researchers to piece the fragments together, decrypt them and then publish their contents. Still, two of them remained undeciphered. The scrolls are written in three languages: Hebrew for the most part, Aramaic, while a few of them are written in Greek. The scroll Dr. Ratzon worked on with Prof. Jonatan Ben-Dov, also from the Bible Department at Haifa University, was written in coded Hebrew and some of the fragments were smaller than 1 square cm. “Very few scrolls that had previously been deciphered were written in this language,” she says via Haaretz.

Unique 364-Day Calendar

The two experts noticed a unique 364-day calendar, which was already known to researchers and differs significantly from the one Jews used at that period. “Most Jews used a calendar that is similar to the one used today. The sect used a calendar that is almost based on a solar year, comprising 364 days. There are months with 30 or 31 days in every season,” Dr. Ratzon stated via Haaretz. And adds, “364 divides into 7, so every date falls on a specific day of the week and every holiday has a fixed date. We know that in the Temple there were disputes between different sects over what happens if Passover falls on Shabbat. What supersedes what, Shabbat or the holiday? This sect solved the problem, since no holiday fell on Shabbat. This scroll details all dates on which Shabbat falls and all the days of the week on which holidays fall.”

Dr. Ratzon also explained that when significant events took place inside a Temple, such as the High Priest making a sacrifice on Yom Kippur, only one calendar could be used. “But this calendar was disputed, which may be one of the reasons this sect left the Temple and went to the desert. They had many disputes and this was one of them – they couldn’t celebrate holidays together,” she told Haaretz.

The scrolls were found in caves on the northwest shore of the Dead Sea, located at Khirbet Qumran in what was what was then British Mandate Palestine – now known as West Bank. (CC BY 2.0)

The “Tekufah”

Furthermore, the researchers also noticed the name used by the sect for a festival commemorated four times a year that marked the transition between the seasons: the Tekufah. The same word in modern-day Hebrew means “period”. “This shows us that the researchers who believed the day of celebrating the transition between the seasons was called by this name were correct, and that this word, as used in the Mishna, was preserved from the days of the Second Temple – it’s a very early concept in halakha [religious Jewish law],” Dr. Ratzon stated via Haaretz, adding that the unique calendar also refers to annual wine and olive harvest festivals no longer observed in Judaism.

Meanwhile, a research team is currently excavating in a 12th cave that might hide further scrolls to be deciphered. The cave was discovered last year and only one blank scroll was found at that time. Details of what has been discovered by the team from Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia are due to be revealed soon.

956,1082,Haitians Just Showed Up In NY To Raise Hell After Trump’s ‘Sh*thole Countries’ Remark,"If there is one thing President Trump has become infamous for in his only one year in office, it’s his insensitive and biased attacks against nearly every minority group that exists within the country, whether this came in the form of his racist remarks towards Mexican citizens as being “rapists” or “criminals”, or blatantly commanding his supporters at his rallies to attack African-American protesters that came to advocate against his hateful policies.

One would think that upon assuming office, such rhetoric would dwindle, as the need to be more unifying in such a high-level office would demand a more neutral tone. However, as Trump has shown since his ventures into the political field, there is no limit to the surprises he has in store.

His most recent controversy came during a closed door meeting, wherein he referred to various impoverished countries as “sh*thole countries”, and asking why the United States accepts immigrants from these nations to begin with. One specific country that was mentioned among them was that of Haiti, which has been stricken with an array of natural disasters that left devastation in their wake. Yet, as activists have shown time and time again since Trump’s taking of power, such speech and ignorant remarks will not go unanswered.

On Friday, hundreds of Haitian natives and Haitian-Americans organized in front of Trump Tower in New York, protesting their distaste of the president’s hateful comments. Although Trump himself was not in New York during the time of the protest, the chants and slogans of these Haitian individuals was heard around the country. According to the New York Daily News,

‘Hundreds of Haitians marched from the Brooklyn Bridge to Trump Tower Friday in protest of the President’s derogatory comments about their homeland. Waving Haitian flags and dancing to the beat of drums and horns, the number of demonstrators multiplied as they streamed into Midtown.’

Today, the Haitian community marched across the Brooklyn Bridge to protest Trump's racist remarks about immigrants. Also, I was there, and it was my first time walking across the bridge after living in Brooklyn for a year! https://t.co/3HEdJrchpG pic.twitter.com/XODcHlalyU — Paul Stremple (@paulstremple) January 20, 2018

Trump’s latest comments not only infuriated the migrants from the countries in question, as well as lawmakers on the other side of the aisle, but also many members of his own party. Almost immediately after the news broke of what the president said, numerous GOP representatives spoke against the nature of his rhetoric, outlining that the things that came out of his mouth was not indicative of the American way.

Rep. Mia Love (R-U.T.), herself a Haitian-American, was outraged at the inability of the president to understand the circumstances and external forces at play, and the inherent struggles that such migrants have to deal with on a daily basis.

Those who were also involved in the meeting also mentioned Rep. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who was reportedly seated close to the president in the meeting, as criticizing Trump immediately after the comments were made, fighting back against the uninformed remarks.

Trump continues to deny making the remarks, despite the fact that a wide array of individuals sitting in on the meeting, both Republican and Democrat, affirmed the accuracy of the distasteful comments. As Trump continues to marginalize minority groups in the country, it is evident that an even greater number of his own base are turning against him as well.

Never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country. Never said “take them out.” Made up by Dems. I have a wonderful relationship with Haitians. Probably should record future meetings – unfortunately, no trust! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 12, 2018

7640,8690,The new “Sisiphobia” for the U.S. administration or Why Obama is so afraid of Gen. Sisi,"CAIRO, EGYPT —Egypt’s interim President Adly Mansour made it official—which should come as nothing unexpected—presidential elections before parliamentary elections, with the presidential election within three months.

Looks like to the Obama administration Republican enemies extend all the way to the Land of the Pharaohs.

Senior Egyptian sources say that the U.S. Secretary of Defense, Chuck Hagel, made several contacts with senior Egyptian armed forces members, about the pressing need to convince Sisi not to run in the presidential elections. Hagel said that Washington is not ‘comfortable’ with Sisi’s presidential candidacy and that the military must forthwith disengage from the ongoing political struggle in Egypt.

Over the last few days, numerous Egyptian, Arabic, and even American newspapers and websites, Including the National, Jerusalem Post, Washington Times, blogger Walid Shoebat and many others, published statements by highly placed political sources in Egypt, outlining the steps carried out by the U.S. administration and President Obama to prevent the candidacy of Gen. Sisi. This resistance to Gen. Sisi is also articulated by some Arab Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait.

As a result of this decision, Gen. Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, charismatic Egyptian Defense Minister, moves one giant step closer to the presidency. Everyone knows that he’s the strongest candidate and the only one who has the support of nearly all political parties to lead Egypt in its war against terrorism led by the Muslim Brotherhood and their militias.

Sources confirm that top Egyptian officials expressed their anger at the U.S. election intervention, stressing that this is an internal affair, and America or any other nation are not welcome to interfere.

The Supreme Council of the Egyptian Armed Forces held a meeting few days ago, in which they discussed the arrangements for the presidential elections. They announced that armed forces will stand by the will of the Egyptians and their choices, and that every Egyptian citizen has the right to run for the presidency as long as they meet the constitutionally prescribed conditions.

Senior sources said that the U.S. Anti-Sisi Movement has already reached the Arab Gulf states, after a high-level U.S. delegation made two visits to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The delegation met with senior officials of the two countries and asked them to put pressure on the Egyptian military to prevent Sisi from running in the election.

Newspapers published several reports about the concerns of the U.S. administration with Al-Sisi in power in Egypt. Some reports even talked about an alleged plot led by Obama to assassinate Sisi to prevent him from gaining the presidency.

So what is the secret of Obama administration’s fear of Gen Sisi? It stems from a new expression I created called “Sisiphobia”!

It seems the current U.S. administration cannot accept nor even tolerate the existence of a powerful independent ruler in the Middle East. U.S. support for Mubarak and the Arab Gulf kings and even the Muslim Brotherhood’s Morsi was only because of the potential of their full cooperation and dependency on America. Their real goal is to maintain the supplies of oil from the Arab Gulf, and holding on to the privilege of U.S. ships in the Suez Canal. The second goal is to ensure the security of Israel and the continued blockade of Iran.

We all know what happened to leaders who tried to oppose America and stand in front of its plans in the Middle East, such as Nasser in Egypt, Abdul-Karim Qassem in Syria and many others in the Middle East or in Latin America. All of this is grippingly narrated in details by Hugh Wilford in his new book The Great American Game and the Arabists.

In general, the U.S. sees Sisi as the same danger. He is a popular hero powered by the overwhelming majority and a lovable character, to boot. Gen. Sisi has the unified support of the armed forces, police and intelligence services.

He overthrew the Muslim Brotherhood rule in Egypt’s, toppled the American project which supports the rise of political Islam forces in the Middle East to implement the U.S. plans concerning the new Middle East and the creative chaos that would ensue. Sisi came along and ruined everything by becoming the strongest enemy of political Islam and terrorist groups, especially the Muslim Brotherhood—backed by Barack Obama, both politically and financially.

A man like Sisi poses a major threat to U.S. schemes in the region. Therefore, the United States cannot feel comfortable with the existence of such a person at the head of the largest and most powerful Arab country.

And that’s without even considering the fears about the exposure of the Obama administration’s secret relations with the Muslim Brotherhood, for which Gen. Sisi holds the smoking gun, some of it already leaked in the $8-billion Obama suppot for the Muslim Brotherhood, which caused great embarrassment for Obama and questioning by Congress.

My ‘Sisiphobia’ has a detectable pattern. While Gen. Sisi defends Christians from the brutality of the Muslim Brotherood, Obama ignores Christians but caters to radical Islam.

Obama wants an army “as well-trained and well-equipped as the US military”, Gen. Sisi would see that as something the treasonous Muslim Brotherhood would do.

While Obama hides his credentials, everything checks on Gen. Sisi’s educational and military records.

Even though it can’t be too long before Sisi’s telephone conversations are tapped by the National Security Agency, it looks like ‘Sisiphobia’ might be here to stay.",http://canadafreepress.com/article/the-new-sisiphobia-for-the-u.s.-administration-or-why-obama-is-so-afraid-of,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

Today's resolution on Jerusalem refers to the Temple Mount exclusively by its Islamic name, Haram al-Sharif.

UN slams Israel 6 times, uses Islamic-only term for Temple Mount, denying Jewish, Christian heritage



GENEVA – The U.N. General Assembly today condemned Israel in six Arab-sponsored resolutions, voting 151 to 6, with 9 abstentions, to adopt a text on Jerusalem which called Temple Mount by its Islamic name only, and voting 105-6-58 to condemn Israel’s presence on the Golan Heights, with the UK breaking for the first time from the EU’s common position to join the U.S. and Canada in opposing the Syrian-sponsored resolution. (Click here for today’s 6 resolutions; here for all 20 of the session.)

UK Votes No, Breaks With EU The British delegate voted No, he told the assembly, because “resolutions which undermine the credibility of UN bodies risk hardening positions on both sides, and do little to advance peace or mutual understanding,” he said. “It is unnecessary, and disproportionate.” “The Syrian regime’s intent is to use this additional resolution to deflect attention from its own criminal actions and indiscriminate slaughter of its own citizens. The duty of the General Assembly is to draw attention to international humanitarian law violations, wherever they occur. This resolution risks discrediting that vital responsibility,” added the UK delegate. UN Watch Analysis The resolutions adopted today “made no mention of Hamas stabbings, shootings or vehicular attacks against Israelis,” said Hillel Neuer, executive director of the Geneva-based monitoring group UN Watch. While some diplomats call the resolutions balanced due to references to incitement and violence by “all sides,” Israel is repeatedly condemned and singled out expressly, while no such accountability or condemnation is applied to the Palestinian Authority, Hamas or Islamic Jihad. By contrast, in this year’s session there will be a total of 6 condemnatory resolutions for the rest of the world combined — with one each on Syria, North Korea, Iran, Crimea, Myanmar, as well as one on criticizing the U.S. embargo on Cuba.

“The U.N. assault on Israel today with this torrent of one-sided resolutions is surreal,” said Neuer. “Today’s resolution on Jerusalem refers to the Temple Mount exclusively by its Islamic name, Haram al-Sharif. At a time when even UNESCO no longer tolerates this terminology, the General Assembly should not be engaged in the denial of Jewish and Christian heritage.” “While there will be a total of 20 resolutions against Israel this session, not a single U.N. General Assembly resolution is planned today or this year for gross human rights abusers such as Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Venezuela, China, Cuba, Pakistan or Zimbabwe.” “At a time when Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and his state-controlled media incite to the continued stabbing and shooting of Israeli Jews, the U.N.’s response is to reflexively condemn Israel in six separate resolutions, each of them one-sided, each of them utterly silent on Palestinian abuses.” Golan Resolution is ‘Absurd’ “Today’s Golan resolution, the second on the area this session, absurdly demands that Israel give over the heights and its 20,000 Druze residents to the control of the genocidal Assad regime.” “It’s astonishing,” said Neuer. “After the Syrian regime has killed its own people by the hundreds of thousands over six years, how can the U.N. call for more people to be subject to Assad’s rule? The timing of today’s text is morally galling, and logically absurd.” “Today’s resolutions claim to care about Palestinians, yet the U.N. is oblivious to the dozens of Palestinians who have been slaughtered, maimed and expelled by Assad’s forces, and more than 3,000 victims killed since 2011.” “Today’s farce at the General Assembly underscores a simple fact: the U.N.’s automatic majority has no interest in truly helping Palestinians, nor in protecting anyone’s human rights; the goal of these ritual, one-sided condemnations remains the scapegoating of Israel,” said Neuer. “The U.N.’s disproportionate assault against the Jewish state undermines the institutional credibility of what is supposed to be an impartial international body. Politicization and selectivity harm its founding mission, eroding the U.N. Charter promise of equal treatment to all nations large and small,” Neuer added.

9165,10361,US Urges EU To ‘Fix’ Iran Deal: Brussels Between A Rock And A Hard Place,"US Urges EU To ‘Fix’ Iran Deal: Brussels Between A Rock And A Hard Place

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

Authored by Peter Korzun via The Strategic Culture Foundation,

President Trump said it was the final waiver extending Iran nuclear deal. He did it with strings attached. The president’s demands include: immediate inspections at sites by international inspectors and “denying Iran paths to nuclear weapons forever” (instead of 10 years as stipulated under current law). New sanctions were issued against 14 people and entities involved with Iran’s ballistic missile programs and a crackdown on government protesters. The president wants the deal to cover Iran’s ballistic missile programs.

Restrictive measures were extended three times last year. And Donald Trump never certified the agreement. Senator Bob Corker, the current chairman of the Senate’s Committee on Foreign Relations, said “significant progress” had been made on bipartisan congressional legislation to address “flaws in the agreement without violating US commitments.”

According to President Trump, there are only two options: either the deal is fixed or the US pulls out. This time he wants to pass the buck, emphasizing that the decision to do it the last time is explained by his desire to secure the agreement of US European allies to fix what he calls “the terrible flaws” of the Joint Commission Plan of Action (JCPOA) or the Iran nuclear deal.

Europeans have 120 days to define their position. From now on, Europe is facing a real hard choice: it’s either dancing to the US tune or being adamant in its support for the deal. The latter will bring it closer to Russia.

Germany said on Jan.12 that it remained committed to the deal and that it would consult with “European partners to find a common way forward”. The European Union remains committed to support the implementation of the JCPOA.

The US plan hardly has a chance of success. Even if Europe joins the US, which is not the case, at least for now, the introduction of any changes to the deal requires the consent of other participants: Russia, China and Iran. Tehran has taken a tough stance, flatly refusing any talks on changes.

Another element of US proposal is also a tall order. The president wants a separate follow-on deal on Iran with the EU “to enshrine triggers that the Iranian government could not exceed related to ballistic missiles.” The consent of other participants is not needed but a separate agreement will bury the JCPOA as the provisions of the two deals will contradict each other. Iran will have to pull out and it will not be its fault and responsibility.

A unilateral US withdrawal is the most feasible option. But it will provoke an international outcry. It’s better to face the consequences being a member of an international coalition. So, the US is aggressively pursuing its goals. The stakes are high and Europe will have to make its choice. If it does not back the deal, its image as a reliable partner will be damaged internationally. The EU has economic interests in Iran. It’ll lose a lot pulling out from the JCPOA. On the other hand, Europe is not at all happy at the prospect of deteriorating relations with the United States.

There is another important aspect not to be forgotten. It’s a win-win situation for Moscow. Russia does not want the Iran deal threatened. Its contribution into it was important enough. But if Brussels succumbs to pressure, it’ll be a political win for Russia to bolster its image as a reliable partner remaining faithful to its obligations. Even with the JCPOA in place, some restrictions on economic and military cooperation remain in force. If the US tears up the deal, there will be no formal obligation to comply with them. Tehran will be pushed to develop even closer ties with Moscow and Beijing.

If the EU stands tall and has it its way, the US European partners may not back the United States in the United Nations, undermining what is called “Western unity”. Brussels and Moscow will get closer. Iran will become a field for cooperation. The process of rapprochement will be spurred if the US imposes restrictive measures on European companies participating in joint projects with Russia, such as Nord Stream-2, for instance. That’s how US sticking with tough stance on Iran may backfire. Acting high and mighty on international stage does not always bring the desired results. Taking well-thought-out foreign policy moves as elements of grand strategy does pay off but the US prefers to act otherwise. By doing so, it risks shooting itself in the foot.

5127,5805,Seductions of Appeasement (Victor Davis Hanson Collection Book 1),"Appeasement defined the global conflicts of the 20th century. Time after time, America and other forces for freedom and democracy withheld their power in efforts to appease the most evil regimes in recent history. Over and over again, the policy of appeasement has ended in disaster. Now, conservative giant Victor Davis Hanson asks: why is appeasement so seductive and where will it take us in the 21st century?

In this collection of Hanson’s best columns from the last four years on the policy of appeasement today and in history, the path becomes clear. If America continues down the road of appeasement with radical Islamic groups and aggressive regimes in Russia and North Korea, the world will see a conflagration rivalling World War II.

The 20th-century world—after horrific losses—made it through its last appeasement disaster; but will we be able to recover to face and ward off the present gathering storm?

What they’re saying about Seductions of Appeasement:

“Victor David Hanson is perhaps the most prescient essayist of his generation. His columns have always been must-reads for anyone interested in Western civlilization, strategy, and America’s place in the world. How wonderful it is to now have such crucial reading all together and at our fingertips.” — Michael Rubin

Resident Scholar, American Enterprise Institute

“Hanson has something useful to say on every major blunder from the muddled way America left Iraq to the misguided effort to engage Iran. And, he says it in a way that is well worth the read.”

A newly issued guideline by the American Heart Association that categorizes adults with blood pressure of 130/80 as hypertensive (high blood pressure) compared to the old standard of 140/90, increasing the number of subjects for whom treatment plans should be initiated to 46% of the American adult population. This new guideline will largely pertain to adults in their 40s who have creeping elevated blood pressure.

Adults with 135/85 blood pressure are said to be at double the risk for a stroke or heart attack compared to adults with a blood pressure of 115/75.

Under guidelines issued 14 years ago, only 32% of American adults were considered hypertensive.

Don’t jump to conclusions

Before American adults who take their blood pressure at home and suddenly find their blood pressure numbers exceed the new 130/80 mark and then run to the doctor’s office for prescription pills to control their blood pressure, they need to know about age-adjusted blood pressure.

(For reference, the first blood pressure number is the pumping or systolic pressure and the second number is the resting or diastolic number. Low blood pressure is below 90/60.)

What the newly issued report didn’t say is that age-adjusted risk assessment suggests higher blood pressure numbers can be tolerated without increased risk for death.

Age-adjusted data, reported by researchers at UCLA a few years back show any risk for death from uncontrolled hypertension doesn’t start till blood pressure is 160/90 or more among adults 55 years of age or older.

So if you are adult over age 55, you need not have fear of dying because your blood pressure is over 130/80. The pronouncement a person has high blood pressure may be a self-fulfilling prophecy. These poorly founded fears of dying of a stroke could provoke anxiety sufficient to raise blood pressure in itself.

The numbers in greater detail

While the overall increased risk for strokes is low at so-called normal (136/88) blood pressure, it carries a five-fold increased risk for stroke when compared to a blood pressure of 110/70. A third of the people who die of strokes and heart attacks have blood pressure below 140/90.

That can be explained blood platelets that have a tendency to clump to form blood clots that impair circulation to the heart and brain. So elevated blood pressure is not the sole predominant factor for strokes. But nonetheless, having the blood pressure you had in your teens is desirable throughout life.

This new target number to treat blood pressure translates to 103 million Americans who categorically have high blood pressure, about 46% of the adult population. Under prior guidelines an estimated 72 million or 32% of American adults were considered to be hypertensive (high blood pressure). The latest review of the medical evidence shows adults with 130-139 systolic pressure doubled their risk for a stroke, heart attack, kidney or heart failure compared to those with lower blood pressure.

HealthDay reports an additional 4.2 million Americans will now be considered hypertensive. An Associated Press story said an additional 30 million Americans would now be categorized as having high blood pressure. Only 2% of the people newly added to the hypertensive category will need medication however. These will be high-risk individuals or those who have already experienced a stroke, heart attack or kidney problems. The new guidelines largely pertain to adults in their 40s with a creeping rise in their blood pressure. Or at least that is what experts say. But the new guidelines will likely be used to justify placement of more and more patients on problematic drugs.

Two or more drugs needed

Here is what prior medical advice was for hypertension: “Many people with high blood pressure need two or more blood pressure-lowering drugs to reach the goal of less than 140/90 mm Hg. Because hypertension is a chronic condition, you will most likely need to take your medication indefinitely.”

Apparently the use of multiple low-dose anti-hypertensive drugs works synergistically over the use of a single drug given in high doses. This low-dose combo-drug approach is said to reduce side effects as well.

There are 10 classes of blood pressure drugs—diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium-channel blockers, beta-blockers, alpha-blockers, central alpha agonists, direct vasodilators, peripheral-acting adrenergic antagonists and direct renin inhibitors. Diuretics (water pills) are often the first choice of drug therapy followed by ACE inhibitors, calcium blockers and vaso-dilators. If any one of these drugs worked, the others would not be needed.

Let’s re-word the lame explanations offered by conventional medicine regarding anti-hypertensive drugs. Here is what the Centers for Disease control says:

“More than a third of American adults have high blood pressure (now 46% according to new definitions) and more than half of them have uncontrolled blood pressure even with prescription of multiple drugs.”

Here is what should be said:

While these drugs are proven to be effective in human clinical trials, the average hypertensive patient does not experience the same result as those enrolled in studies. The more pills to swallow the greater the problem of non-compliance by the patient. And, very bluntly, none of these drugs is effective on their own as most all patients have to take multiple drugs to get their numbers under control. And frankly, modern medicine ends up treating blood pressure as if it is a drug deficiency. Unfortunately, American adults will not hear of this from conventional sources of health information.

Relative risk versus absolute risk

In 1986 the British Medical Journal published a guideline paper that asserted “there will be no appreciable benefit to an individual patient from treating a diastolic pressure of less than 100.” While drugs lower blood pressure, they may not reduce the risk for a stroke or heart attack or death. But the medical profession marched forward, recognizing patients are not likely to stop smoking, adhere to a healthy diet and trim excess weight, so doctors commonly skipped these measures and begin treating hypertensive patients as if they were drug deficient.

The effectiveness of anti-hypertensive drugs is established on marginal numbers. A relative risk is cited, such as a report published in the JAMA Internal Medicine journal (2014) that concluded beta blockers (drugs that slow the heart rate) do not significantly reduce all-cause mortality (0.94 risk or -6% mortality reduction) while ACE inhibitors significantly reduced risk of all-cause mortality by 13% (0.87 risk of -13%). But in hard numbers anti-hypertensive drugs:

Prevent 1 death among 125 drug users

(less than 1% effective) Prevent 1 stroke in 67 drug users

(1.5% benefit; 98.5% ineffective) Prevent 1 heart attack among 100 drug users

(1% effective) 1 in 10 patients are harmed by medication side effects (10%)

These numbers look so weak because modern medicine places millions of patients on drugs when strokes and heart attacks only occur in 1 in thousands of people over a time period like 5 years.

According the statistics provided by the Centers for Disease control, 2.7% of adults will experience a stroke in their lifetime and the number of deaths is 41.7 per 100,000. However, new stroke treatment guidelines would initiate treatment including drugs for 46,000 adults for the remainder of their lifetime when only 2700 would experience a stroke over a period of many years.

Using these numbers, possibly 6% of patients using anti-hypertensive drugs would avoid a stroke or death while 94% would derive no health benefit and experience nothing but side effects.

So millions of people are placed on drugs that would never experience a stroke or heart attack to spare the few who actually are at risk. Since strokes can occur for other reasons than hypertension, such as clumpy blood platelets, it is difficult to realize a health benefit from taking these drugs.

Weigh the side effects

Millions of patients taking anti-hypertensive drugs experience chronic coughs, nausea, dizziness, mental depression, heart failure, fatigue and gastric irritation.

For example, there are an estimated 35-40 million patients worldwide that have been prescribed ACE inhibitors for hypertension. About 5-35% of these subjects or 2-14 million will develop chronic cough. Side effects outweigh the imagined health benefits.

On a worldwide scale, there are an estimated 1 billion hypertensive adults with a malady that is attributed to 7.1 million early deaths a year. In the U.S. some 50 million are under treatment for hypertension. This is in a population where only 1 in 10 consume enough fruits and vegetables.

The percentage of patients whose blood pressure remains under control after withdrawal of drugs ranges from 3% to 74%.

In one study of patients on medication for high blood pressure, 33% took one drug, 35% two drugs and 32% took 3 or more medications. About 35% of patients did not adhere to the prescribed medication regimen.

Treatment resistant hypertension

Patients whose blood pressure is controlled with four or more medications are categorized as having resistant hypertension.

Failure to maintain healthy blood pressure numbers even with drug therapy is common. In one large study, only 67% of participants had their systolic blood pressure lowered below 140 whereas 92% of participants achieved a goal of 90 or less diastolic pressure.

Long term, only 40% of patients continue to take anti-hypertensive drugs.

Strikingly, commonly used over-the-counter anti-inflammatory pain relieving drugs (aspirin, acetaminophen) are the most common pharmacologic agents that worsen blood pressure.

Diabetes complicates hypertension. In order to achieve the lower blood pressure goal recommended for patients with diabetes, an average range of 2.8 to 4.2 antihypertensive medications will be needed.

Resistant hypertension

While it is widely quoted that resistant hypertension accounts for 20-30% of cases of hypertension, a modern review suggests lack of compliance in taking drugs and other factors are more likely to explain the problem.

There is a difference between blood pressure measurements taken in the doctor’s office and at home. A phenomenon known as “white-coat hypertension” (patients sees the doctor’s white coat and blood pressure rises) is identified as the reason for this difference. This is pertinent when determining if patients truly have treatment resistant hypertension. While it is often said 20-30% of hypertensive patients are resistant to drug treatment, the occurrence of treatment resistance is cut in half (~10%) when blood pressure is measured at home.

A study of 140 patients with treatment resistant hypertension is instructive:

140 treatment resistant hypertensive patients

69 were taking 3 different classes of medications

15 of these 69 patients (22%) controlled their blood pressure when blood pressure monitoring was conducted at home

20 of these 69 patients (29%) were not taking their medications as prescribed

34 of these 69 patients (49%) adhered to medication regimens and had uncontrolled hypertension and were likely taking suboptimal drug dosages

So what are adults with high blood pressure to do? That is the topic of a forthcoming report.

6304,7211,"Scott Lively, A One-Eyed Man in the Land of the Blind","Last week the Rev. Scott Lively, an independent candidate for Governor of Massachusetts , joined seven other declared candidates in the state’s first gubernatorial forum on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues at the Boston Public Library.

Rather than join in with the others in the hallelujah “pro-gay” chorus, Lively addressed homosexual behaviors from a medical, sociological, and biblical viewpoint. Lively’s common sense language left politicians and audience members startled like they’d been slapped in the face with some cheap aftershave.

At times Lively was interrupted by grunts and guffaws from disgruntled audience members and rude and snide comments from the candidates, yet their mockery, scorn, and hostility did not deter him. He presented a clinic on how to fight back against hostility and overwhelming odds. He kept his composure and conveyed his message.

When it was over, Lively stood alone as the only independent thinker among the group of me-too candidates parroting gaystapo talking points. As one reporter put it, “Most of the candidates for governor had the same message ... Lively was the forum’s outlier. He lived up to his last name ...”

For too long now, conservative politicians and pro-family leaders have been reluctant to tell the truth about homosexuality. When they are confronted with political correctness, they back peddle and compromise rather than stand tall and fight on principles.

All too often they collapse under the pressure and run away instead of standing up to the name-calling and engaging the battle. It’s obvious they’re controlled by fear, but what’s sad is that they seem to be the only ones who don’t know it.

If nothing else, Lively has shown that repeating truths forcefully and fearlessly is the only way to defeat a homosexual movement built on lies, deceit, and disinformation.

In last week’s Massachusetts candidate forum, the Rev. Scott Lively proved he’s more than just some run-of-the-mill independent candidate for governor; he’s the proverbial one-eyed man in the land of the blind. Whether or not he’s made king is another matter altogether.",http://canadafreepress.com/article/scott-lively-a-one-eyed-man-in-the-land-of-the-blind,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

Implementing new strategies affecting the economy, changing international trade agreements and taking on the complexities of immigration reform are only a few of the challenges facing President Trump and American society. The President not only must find solutions to many formidable problems but he must navigate through unfriendly political waters in Washington. Add to the mix that hundreds of thousands of students across this nation have received years of unchallenged liberal indoctrination, and that kind of brainwashing produces real consequences especially when a percentage believe that physical violence is a legitimate means to an end. So whatever path the President decides to take he does so within his political party that has a severe identity crisis, the opposition political party and media that desperately want him impeached and a country that is divided in a way never before seen since the Civil War.

There are many Americans that refuse to believe and perhaps are on some level of denial of the fact that the left seeks to upend American culture and rewrite history. It seems unimaginable that America has within its borders people who not only reject the very foundation and principles upon which this country came into existence but are actively seeking to alter American society toward a more historically failed socialist system.

The term “the left,” can mean many things to different people but mainly the term is referring to individuals sympathetic to or members of the Democratic party whose political and cultural makeup and motives are inconsistent with traditional American values.

Imagine how those same families of the past would have reacted if one of the three networks created a program series based on the future scandals of the Obama Administration. It would be a kind of “Back to the Corrupt Future” television series, where episodes would cover the numerous national disgraces.

The interesting thing about a swamp is that you don’t know what’s in it until you start to drain it.

Spying on citizens, undermining political rivals using government agencies with impunity and ignoring the rule of law destroy the stability of a nation. They make up the vapors emanating from the Washington swamp that President Trump declared he would drain but they are only the bubbling byproducts of the massive network of corrupt politicians, lobbyists, politically appointed ideological judges and lawless law enforcement officials.

Entrenched power entangled with opposing yet co-dependent desires that run counter to the interests of the American people is the sum total of the motivating forces within the swamp that Trump is facing.",http://canadafreepress.com/members/1/RickHayes/1064,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

50 Cent says he forgot that he agreed to accept Bfor the purchases of his 2014 album Animal Ambition. A unit of the cryptocurrency was already worth hundreds of dollars back then, but since the value has increased, the rapper’s 700 Bitcoins are now worth millions.

50 Cent’s Bitcoin holdings are actually worth about $7.5 million today. “Not Bad for a kid from South Side, I’m so proud of me,” 50 Cent wrote in an Instagram post citing TMZ‘s story about his unexpected windfall. Alongside emojis of a sack of money and a person holding up their hands in a “What?” pose, he added, “LOL.”

According to TMZ‘s sources, Animal Ambition pulled in about 700 Bitcoin in sales … over $400,000, which supposedly sat dormant in his account for years. Fast-forward to today when Bitcoin’s value has fluctuated between $10,000 and $12,000 per coin, and 50 Cent is sitting on anywhere between $7 million and $8.5 million in the world’s most well-known cryptocurrency.

On the day the album came out, 50 Cent took part in an Ask Me Anything (AMA) on Reddit. As International Business Times reports, he talked about accepting Bitcoin as a way to “stay with times.”

Back when 50 Cent released his 2014 album, Bitcoin was mostly known as a “virtual currency” that was still trying to push its way into the mainstream. The game company Zynga accepted it for some purchases; so did Dell and electronics retailer Newegg and by the end of the year, so did Microsoft. Those who got on the Bitcoin bandwagon made a good amount of money, while skeptics still seem amazed that the cryptocurrency has held a piece of the US market.

3882,4422,Is The Glass Half Full or Half Empty? Pessimism Vs Optimism (Video),"You’re seeing so much news about positivity on the media for a reason – people are finally understanding the true power of it! Do you consider yourself an optimist or a pessimist?

Being optimistic might sound like a grandma term to you and you might even think that it isn’t worth anything, but oh boy would you be wrong! You might even go as far as saying that positivity is the key to a happy life. It truly is worth more than any amount of money, cars, or fancy smartphones. Being an optimistic person makes you much more appealing and makes other people feel comfortable. By being optimistic you might completely turn around someone’s day, or even a few people’s!

Optimism is great for many different reasons and it all around makes life more enjoyable for you and everyone around you. It could very well be the answer to changing the world! However, the opposite is also true: pessimism is extremely negative, but somehow never leaves our minds. Many people argue whether it is a natural occurrence or a personality flaw, but we do know one thing for sure – it itself sucks… a lot. Nobody likes to be around someone who is constantly whining and complaining about how hard life is or how they’ve been mistreated, unfairly done, or wronged in any of the slightest ways. It might not be politically correct to admit, but we all know it’s true – Nobody likes a negative nelly, and even the nelly himself is tortured by a negative perception! Our perception makes up our entire reality – which means a negative perception inevitably equals a negative life.

If you think you might qualify as a negative person – and that’s most of us – it is never too late to change your attitude. With practice and the willingness to come out of your comfort zone and learn, you can completely transform your life.

So – are you an optimist or a pessimist?

By Greg Hunter’s USAWatchdog.com

Money manager Peter Schiff correctly predicted the financial meltdown in 2008. Now, 10 years later, what does Schiff see today? Schiff says, “I predicted a lot more than just the stock market going down back then. I predicted the financial crisis, but more importantly, I predicted what the government would do as a result of the financial crisis and what the consequences of that would be because that’s where we’re headed. The real crash I wrote about in my most recent book is still coming. . . . This is the third gigantic bubble that the Fed has inflated, and when this one pops, it’s not going to be ‘the third time is a charm.’ It’s going to be ‘three strikes and you’re out.’ I think this bubble is too big to pop. I think it’s the mother of all bubbles, and when it bursts, there is not a bigger one that the Fed is going to be able to inflate to mask these problems, meaning we can’t kick the can down the road anymore.”

This time, the crisis is going to hit everyone in the wallet. Schiff goes on to say, “I think the problem we are going to be confronted with is going to be much worse than a financial crisis. It is going to be a dollar crisis, and it is going to be a sovereign debt crisis where the bonds people are worried about are not some sub-prime mortgages. . . . It’s going to be the U.S. government that people are worried about and the solvency of the U.S. government and the Treasury bonds. If it’s a dollar crisis and people are worried about the dollar, the only thing worse than owning a dollar today is owning the promise of being paid in dollars in the future. I don’t think we have the courage to default and admit to our creditors that we don’t have the money and we can’t repay. I think we will create all the money that we need so we can pretend to repay, but what we end up doing is wiping out the debt with inflation.”

So, how long can it go on? Schiff says, “How high can the debt go? I don’t know and you don’t know. . . .How many straws can you put on a camel’s back? You don’t know until you put that final straw that’s one too many and you break his back. So, can we go to $25 trillion in debt? Maybe. At some point, we are going to break the back of the camel with all this debt. Then we are going to find out how much debt we can pile on, and it’s not going to be pretty. Everybody is going to lose. Everybody is going to get wiped out who has been partying in the stock market, the bond market and the real estate market. The dollar is going to tank, and purchasing power is going to get wiped out.”

Inversely, Schiff says it is the same with the suppressed gold and silver markets. Schiff contends, “They can’t keep doing it, and it will end. It’s just like how much debt can we take on. It’s not an unlimited amount. We will know when we get there. How long can they keep the price of gold suppressed? We will know when we get there. At some point, the price is going to explode because there is real physical buying, and all that paper selling can’t camouflage that. . . . People don’t trust fiat currencies . . . . More and more people are looking for alternatives, and the real alternative is gold. When they embrace it, it’s going to overwhelm central banks’ ability to suppress the price. In the meantime, enjoy the gift that they are giving.”

6726,7685,Obama’s Misstep On Iran,"We cannot listen to Iran’s Ahmadinejad posturing on the expansion of the Iranian atomic energy program, without recalling Obama’s dramatic reversal on the U.S. land based missile defense system in Europe only days ago. The blunder was not in the reversal, but in its timing and its process.

The degree to which Iran has advanced its uranium enrichment capabilities will remain an unknown factor, and the international community reaction will continue to be perplexed, and marooned in paralysis of fear. Iran will not let anyone into whatever enrichment facility exists. No one will see what the ayatollahs do not wish to make public, sending us into recollections of the disastrous outcome following a long hide-and-seek dance with Saddam Hussein seven years ago. This leaves the world, Israel and the U.S. in particular, with a conundrum of literally seismic proportions. Iran’s nuclear progress is not new, nor is it news. What is new is the loss of one very powerful strategic negotiating tool that could have been useful in addressing Iran’s dangerous belligerence—the land-based European missile defense system.

When Obama backed off the deployment of a missile defense system in Europe, he did so without gaining a single concession from Putin and Russia. Russia had long blustered and railed against the U.S. missile deployment plan. Putin claimed the missiles were intended to threaten Russian sovereignty in the region, and that they were not meant to defend against Iran. The hovering menace from the U.S. was a significant affront to Putin’s self-image. Obama’s abrogation of such significant “stance” on behalf of the United States suggests that this Administration learned nothing from the Ronald Reagan approach to international negotiations. Reagan changed the world when he boasted of his Strategic Defense Initiative satellite based defense system. The long list of concessions extracted from Gorbachev by Reagan, as well as his brilliance throughout the process of negotiations, should be compulsory reading for any student of Presidential impact on history.

Disclosure that Obama has known about Iran’s second uranium-enrichment facility all along, and that he has sprung an international trap for Iran, as some media such as the Washington Post are now suggesting, is peculiar analysis, as well as it is pandering in the extreme. Obama gave up a major negotiating card that could have been used to push Russia toward joining the strengthening of sanctions against Iran. China cannot be counted on to assist any future confrontation with Iran, having taken itself out of the equation with investments in Iran to feed its own requirements for energy and natural resources. The only other power, whose advocacy is truly needed in the region for serious containment of the ayatollahs in Tehran, is Russia. China and Russia provide Iran with enough trade to successfully finance the Ayatollahs through many more elections no matter what sanctions Obama might think of adding to the existing limitations. Iran’s path to becoming a nuclear power appears unobstructed.

The alternative to the controversial land based system being mothballed, according to Obama, is cheaper, quicker and more effective. This means the decision to embrace the new technology is very likely a good one. If you had this information in hand, would you have run headlong into an announcement, given that the planned European shield had been a major thorn under Putin’s belly? The diplomatic clout that the West’s tension with Iran has provided Putin still remains, and no concessions have been extracted, nor are we likely to see any extracted in the near future. Russia’s response has been to provide more rhetoric, and more blustering. The Russian envoy to NATO, Dmitry Rogozin, said, “...Americans have simply put their own mistake right. And we are not duty-bound to pay for someone to put their own mistakes right.” Putin will continue to view Iran as an economic opportunity that will be exploited without interference from the West. The threat of crisis and instability in the region will also maintain energy prices at levels that Russia requires to finance its annual operating budget.

Adding to the confusion of signals emanating from the White House, Obama suggested that he could resurrect the European missile defense plan if Russia doesn’t help with the threat presented by Iran. This kind of accessory statement further weakens America’s hand. It suggests a lack of resolve on the initial reversal of the strategy, and it also infers apprehension about the new strategy and the underlying technology. Can America rely on the new capabilities and technologies or not? Are the interceptor capacities more flexible and cost-effective? Are the advanced sensor technologies capable of detecting and tracking enemy missiles, or aren’t they? Why would Obama even hint at such uncertainty?

The signals showered on Americans and their allies by this Administration’s decisions and announcements are confusing, but to Russia, they seem to be welcome and they reinforce its strategy of saber rattling. Sanctions have not deterred Iran’s ayatollahs. Now, with the loss of a major strategic and negotiating option against the Kremlin, the enlistment of the Russian bear’s assistance will undoubtedly be impossible, and will lead to a more belligerent Iran. We can expect an increase in its destabilizing activities in Iraq and Afghanistan, and its financing of terrorism. The violence we witnessed against the Iranian people after the recent elections should be indication enough that a strategy pursuing, “engagement that is honest and grounded in mutual respect,” as Obama wishes it, is simply just that, ...wishful thinking.",http://canadafreepress.com/article/obamas-misstep-on-iran,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

As yet another indication that the university campus has become “an island of repression in a sea of freedom,” last March a pro-Israel group, Hasbara Fellowships Canada, was barred from participating in a “Social Justice Week” event organized by the Student Association of Durham College and University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT). The stated reason for the exclusion? The student association (which, not coincidentally, had just approved a pro-BDS resolution against Israel) informed the Hasbara group that since the “organization seems closely tied to the state of Israel . . . it would be against the motion to provide any type of resources to your organization.”

While the term “social justice” has a seemingly benign and positive connation—and certainly to those who so vigorous fight for it—the reality is that, as columnist Jonah Goldberg observed in his book, The Tyranny of Clichés: How Liberals Cheat in the War of Ideas, social justice is actually “an empty vessel to be filled with any and all leftist ideals, and then promptly wielded as a political bludgeon against any and all dissenters . . . .”

Obama Administration has decided to wage war on business inversions, by declaring companies who wish to move their headquarters abroad to be ""unpatriotic"", and ""tax dodgers""

Anti-business Policies and the Liberty of Risk

Ben Casselman penned a piece a year agoin the Wall Street Journal, which documented the decline of risk-taking in business ventures. Hard data showed that both the number of new companies and the use of venture capital is waning. He rightfully suggested that this downward trend is a major contributor to the fact that the recovery from the recent recession is so painfully slow and anemic.

Casselman went on to explain that economists aren’t entirely sure what is behind the decline and gave some potential causes: health care costs, licensing requirements, an aging population, and an increase in large corporations are among some of the suggestions. While these factors do contribute, Casselman missed the glaring elephant in the room: the government, and her anti-business policies, do more to stifle free business activity than any other than any other single mitigating circumstance. Looking at the article a year later, the situation has continued to decline. Here’s how. This administration has been exceedingly heavy-handed in its efforts to demonize businesses, while promising that businesses will be highly taxed and regulated. Whether it is labor regulation by the NRLB or environmental regulation by the EPA, government interference has been overreaching and restrictive. Additionally, there have been huge increases in both criminal rules and regulations about what businesses are allowed and not allowed to do—from nitpicky labor rules, to dictating employee minutiae, to minimum wage requirements, all which restrict business hiring—and even employee firing. The EEOC has joined in with several lawsuits against private businesses, deemed byone judgeas “laughable”, “based on unreliable data”, and “rife with analytical error”. Litigation-friendly environment More unfortunately, Obama has provided the background for a litigation-friendly environment. If a larger, more financially stable company wants to steal something from a smaller company, they can sue them or just threaten with a costly legal battle. Or, if labor doesn’t like them, they can force them to shut them down as an alternative to litigation. What’s worse, Obama’s Labor Secretary pick, Thomas Perez, particularly favorsthe useof “disparate impact” theory with business labor disputes, because,as NRO noted, it“sets a very low bar for proving discrimination. Under it, prosecutors need not prove intent, merely that minorities have suffered a disparate impact from some action”.

Obama Administration has decided to wage war on business inversions, by declaring companies who wish to move their headquarters abroad to be “unpatriotic”, and “tax dodgers” More recently, the Obama Administration has decided to wage war on business inversions, by declaring companies who wish to move their headquarters abroad to be “unpatriotic”, and “tax dodgers”. Instead of fixing theroot problem—which is that the United States is the only major nation to tax American companies on foreign profits as well as domestic—he instead suddenlytightens the rulesfor companies and calls the perfectly legal process of inversion to be a “loophole”. Couple that with the fact that we have the highest corporate tax rate in the world, and its no wonder that the United States recently ranked32 out of 34 countriesin the new “International Tax Competitiveness Index”. Of course, there will be some successes. It just now takes a higher level of skill, ideas, and money to exercise your entrepreneurial spirit. It’s not like there won’t be the Jeffrey Bezos or the Bill Gates or the Steve Jobs. They’ll still come through everything despite the immense impediments. The problem is that it is the middle entrepreneurs who are having a hard time getting started, and even when they do, they will likely get discouraged in the mess. Yet it is precisely this middle group, the bread-and-butter of small businesses, that have made this country great. That future is threatened, as we are seeing now in subtle shifts within the realm of business making. The future of this country will continue to decline if the anti-business sentiment that Obama has unleashed is allowed to continue. The middle entrepreneurs, the mom-and-pops, the family businesses are the ones that make up the difference between the very tepid growth that we are seeing and the strong growth and recovery that could be better if businesses actually had better opportunity. Businesses go into business not to comply with government dictates, but to provide a product, a service, to make things. The very liberty for Americans to have the opportunity to succeed and fail, to take risk, to survive, and to thrive is under siege.

The Homeopathic Answer to Mumps Written by Larry Malerba, DO It is becoming increasingly clear that the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine is failing to live up to its alleged preventative benefits

Illness as an Obstruction to Growth of Consciousness Written by Larry Malerba, DO The following is an excerpt from Dr. Larry Malerba’s new book, Dynamic Medicine: The World According to Homeopathy, which offers an insightful examination of this unusual healing art and science…

FDA’s Homeopathic Teething Tablet Warning Lacks Credibility Written by Larry Malerba, DO On September 30, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a strongly worded warning (not a recall) to the general public regarding unsubstantiated dangers supposedly related to homeopathic teething tablets.

Is Pharma Trying to Eliminate the Homeopathic Competition? Written by Larry Malerba, DO Homeopathy is a thorn in the side of Pharma because of the fact that its unique medicines are FDA regulated, safe, inexpensive, and can't be patented.

In Defense of Homeopathy Written by Larry Malerba, DO Homeopathy is here to stay. Despite relentless criticism from skeptics and fundamentalists, homeopathy has withstood the test of time.

Understanding The Sickness of the American Psyche Written by Larry Malerba, DO There is a deep sickness beginning to take hold of the American psyche that threatens to undermine the already shaken stability of the lives of everyone in this country.

The Rise of Scientific Fundamentalism Written by Larry Malerba, DO Contrary to the beliefs of some, science is not an impenetrable body of settled fact that must be defended at all costs in the name of truth. When science becomes a worldview—a philosophy of life, a metaphysical framework that explains existence—it is no longer science; it is scientism.

FDA Scrutinizes Homeopathy - Urgent Action Required! Written by Larry Malerba, DO On the heels of a recent upswing in anti-homeopathy activity in Australia, Canada, and the UK, the FDA recently gave surprise notice of its intent to review the legal status of homeopathic products in the U.S. marketplace.

4332,4902,Bringing ‘Avatar’-like glowing plants to the real world,"Nature has produced many bioluminescent organisms, however, plants are not among them. Most attempts so far to create glowing greenery — decorative tobacco plants in particular — have relied on introducing the genes of luminescent bacteria or fireflies through genetic engineering. But getting all the right components to the right locations within the plants has been a challenge. To gain better control over where light-generating ingredients end up, Michael S. Strano and colleagues recently created nanoparticles that travel to specific destinations within plants. Building on this work, the researchers wanted to take the next step and develop a “nanobionic,” glowing plant.



The team infused watercress and other plants with three different nanoparticles in a pressurized bath. The nanoparticles were loaded with light-emitting luciferin; luciferase, which modifies luciferin and makes it glow; and coenzyme A, which boosts luciferase activity. Using size and surface charge to control where the sets of nanoparticles could go within the plant tissues, the researchers could optimize how much light was emitted. Their watercress was half as bright as a commercial 1 microwatt LED and 100,000 times brighter than genetically engineered tobacco plants. Also, the plant could be turned off by adding a compound that blocks luciferase from activating luciferin’s glow.

40,50,People Are Getting Panic Attacks Simply By Watching Video Of Alien-Like Bug ( video),"Arachniphobia is probably one of the most prevalent phobias out there. It is a hard question to answer with hard numbers, as phobias are not easily understood by those who have yet to face all their fears. While many claim to have a fear of heights or an aversion to tight spaces, neither of these predispositions are as predominant as a fear of spiders.

But here is the thing: many people probably don’t even know they have arachniphoabia. Why is this? Because they have not yet come face-to-face with a spider that really can give them nightmares.

Let all of this change today as you face your fears and observe one of the most disgusting and scary bugs on the planet.

Footage of a South American beetle has been shared across the internet, and it has got many people more grossed out than ever before. The footage was posted by a Japanese bug enthusiast who thought it worthwhile to post the movements of this disturbing beetle. While we don’t mind observing nature in it’s natural habitat, this just takes it to a whole other level! If you though all of nature’s creatures are beautiful, you should really check this face-eating bug out to see what nature is really capable of.

The creature is known as the puppa of a Hercules beetle. It is born in the forests or the undergrowth and spends the first two years of it’s life where it should remain: out of site. It feats on rotten and dying wood for the majority of it’s first two years of life, before gathering the strength to lock itself in a cocoon and grow an exoskeleton. The exoskeleton is the outer shell of the creative that helps it develop protection and strength as it develops.

Slowly the creature grows into a larger form and emerges out of the cocoon when it is at full strength and maximum creepy-ness. In it’s full adult form it has huge pincers and can grow to over 6.7 inches!

We have the footage from the Twitter feed of Ziya Tong, a Japanese-Canadian nature journalist specializes in the most odd creatures that roam the earth.

“Woah. This is the puppa of the Hercules beetle,” he wrote. “Like something right out of Aliens. And … it moves!”

The reaction to his post was not met with resounding excitement and curiosity to say the least. One Twitter follower wrote: “Whatever it is … KILL IT WITH FIRE!”

This is a justifiable reaction to such a grotesque and powerful spider/bug. The one consolation? That most of us in the north o the equator will ever have an issue with these scuttling into our bedrooms while we sleep. They are found only in South America, where the climate is warm enough for them to live year round and find all the rotten wood they need to survive.

Even though most of us will never see this beetle in real life, we can still develop a real fear of it. Whether arachnophobia or just a fear of scary bugs – don’t spend long looking at it or you might start believing it is real!",http://awm.com/people-are-getting-panic-attacks-simply-by-watching-video-of-alien-like-bug-video/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

“[The] Flu is everywhere in the US right now….This is the first year we’ve had the entire continental US at the same level (of flu activity) at the same time. It has been an early flu season that seems to be peaking now, with a 5.8% increase in laboratory-confirmed cases this week over last.”

Those are the shocking words from the CDC’s influenza branch director Dr. Dan Jernigan. It is being reported that if we stay on this path, we could truly be looking at the worse flu season in more than 50 years. So far over 106 deaths have been accounted for and the flu has struck 46 states across the country. Considering flu season lasts from October to May, we still have a long way to go.

9574,10808,"First Redskins, Now LSU Tigers are targets of PC Lunatics","Subscribe to Canada Free Press for FREE

This “march toward justice” is a march toward insanity, a march toward devastation. The efforts to erase history, remove monuments, change names and mascots must stop immediately. If not, our country will disintegrate before our very eyes

First Redskins, Now LSU Tigers are targets of PC Lunatics

In our toxic age of political correctness, nothing is immune from liberal political attacks, even the beautiful, majestic and endangered tigers. It seems obvious that tigers should be supported since their numbers are dwindling the in the wild and their natural habitats are constantly shrinking. Most people probably think it is innocent for Louisiana State University (LSU) to feature tigers as their mascot and display a well maintained “Mike the Tiger” in an air conditioned, deluxe enclosure right outside the football stadium. This $3 million habitat is a mansion that tigers in the wild or any animal for that matter would love to call home. Unfortunately, all those assumptions are incorrect in an age of stifling political correctness. Today, it seems that the “Fighting Tigers” are racist symbols of oppression to African American students at LSU.

“Fighting Tigers” was adopted at LSU to honor the famed Louisiana infantry of the Civil War In 1895, the nickname “Fighting Tigers” was adopted at LSU to honor the famed Louisiana infantry of the Civil War. These fighters were known as “Tigers” and were celebrated for being particularly courageous and battle-hardened warriors. The name was given to LSU by the original football coach of the school, Dr. Charles E. Coates. He wanted his football teams to display the same fight on the gridiron that the Civil War soldiers showed on the battlefield. Since that time, the nickname has honored both the beautiful big cats of the jungle and the Louisiana Confederate soldiers. Sadly, in our age of historical revisionism, when Confederate monuments are under attack across the country, anything associated with the South during the Civil War has become controversial, even a harmless nickname. Today, an online petition at http://www.Change.org has gathered 568 signatures demanding that LSU remove the Tigers mascot. The organizer, LaMallori LSU, claims that the Tigers mascot is “the most prevalent Confederate symbol in the United States” and that it is “incredibly insulting” for black students to deal with the racism associated with the mascot. LaMallori LSU also states that the Louisiana Civil War infantry mistreated slaves by engaging in violent abuse of the innocent African Americans of that era.

Only left-wing agitators would link the use of the nickname Tigers with racism This mascot has been used for 122 years, it is a symbol of pride for LSU fans. Historically, it has not been viewed by any LSU supporter as a symbol of racism. Only left-wing agitators would link the use of the nickname Tigers with racism. The petition is just the latest outrageous move by leftists to remove monuments and change names of anything associated with the Confederacy. The left was emboldened when the liberal Democrat Mayor of New Orleans, Mitch Landrieu, was successful in removing four Confederate monuments in the city. In the aftermath, organizers have targeted dozens of other monuments to remove and names to change. The next step for Louisiana and the rest of the South is unknown. Remaining Confederate monuments in New Orleans are being defaced and damaged while the Mayor has done nothing to protect them. It is almost as if Mayor Landrieu is encouraging the destruction of these valuable monuments. Obviously, mascots are not immune to this crazed, disturbing movement. In the NFL, activists have targeted the Washington Redskins because the nickname is supposedly offensive to Native Americans. Never mind that the name was originally bestowed on the team as a sign of respect and honor for Native Americans.

Continued below... For years, teams with the nickname Indians or Rebels have been pressured to change In the world of college sports today, the Tigers are not alone in coming under fire. For years, teams with the nickname Indians or Rebels have been pressured to change. At Ole Miss, the Colonel Reb mascot is no longer used while the Mississippi state flag is no longer allowed in the stadium. What is next? Tulane University was named after a wealthy benefactor of the Confederacy, Paul Tulane. Does that school name need to change? The LSU Tigers petition has not generated many signatures, thankfully, but it is creating significant publicity nationwide. With the politically correct leadership of universities across the nation, including LSU, there is no guarantee that these types of demands will not be given earnest consideration. The overall ultimatums in the petition are quite chilling. The organizer calls for an end to not only the Tigers nickname, but also for “the day when every symbol of white oppression is torn down.” The petition also takes aim at the “Mike the Tiger” mascot. It states, “It’s also cruel to cage a wild animal for the amusement of privileged white people. They’ve never been in a cage!” This “march toward justice” is a march toward insanity, a march toward devastation. The efforts to erase history, remove monuments, change names and mascots must stop immediately. If not, our country will disintegrate before our very eyes.

In an Ancient Synagogue in Israel a rare mosaic of Noah’s Ark and the parting of the Red Sea has been unearthed. The artifacts are from the 5th century and were discovered in an Jewish village in Israel’s Lower Galilee. The excavations were directed by Jodi Magness, a professor in the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill College of Arts and Sciences.

The first mosaic panel depicts soldiers being swallowed by large fish, surrounded by overturned chariots in the parting of the Red Sea (Photo: Jim Haberman/UNC Chapel Hill):

The second mosaic panel depicts pairs of animals, such as lions, leopards, bears, and donkeys making their way to the ark (Photo: Jim Haberman/UNC Chapel Hill):

According to Jodi Magness, “This is by far the most extensive series of biblical stories ever found decorating the mosaic floor of an ancient synagogue.”

In the video below youtuber Paul Begley gives his views as to what these two mosaic panels may actually depict.

4546,5125,Kushner’s Records At Deutsche Bank Subpoenaed As Mueller Avoids Trump,"Kushner’s Records At Deutsche Bank Subpoenaed As Mueller Avoids Trump

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

As it turns out, President Trump’s legal team was telling the truth when it said that Special Counsel Robert Mueller hadn’t subpoenaed financial records related to the president’s business activities from German lender Deutsche Bank, contrary to Bloomberg reporting.

On Friday, the New York Times reported that Deutsche Bank had received a subpoena for records on accounts linked to the Kushner Companies, the family real-estate empire of Trump son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner. This contradicts reports by both German and US media organizations dating back to July which insinuated that Mueller had been digging into Trump’s multi-decade career in real estate. Even after his infamous bankruptcies in the 1990s, Trump managed to maintain a functioning lending relationship with Deutsche, which has lent him and his businesses hundreds of millions of dollars over the years.

Unsurprisingly, these stories also got a few other key details wrong. The subpoena in question was sent by the Eastern District of New York, not special counsel Robert Mueller and his team. However, it’s notable that three prosecutors from Mueller’s team once worked for the Eastern District – which could’ve been one reason for the mix up.

Mr. Kushner, who was the Kushner Companies’ chief executive until January, still owns part of the business after selling some of his stake. The family businesses include many legal entities. It is not clear which records were sought by prosecutors, what they are seeking to learn from them or to what degree, if any, they directly involve Mr. Kushner. There is no indication that the subpoena is related to the investigation being conducted by Robert S Mueller III, the special counsel, into Russian meddling in the 2016 United States presidential election. Three prosecutors on Mr. Mueller’s team previously worked at the United States attorney’s office in Brooklyn, one as recently as this year. Federal prosecutors around the country typically check with Justice Department headquarters when their investigations may overlap.

The justification for the Kushner Company subpoena is for now unclear. While it had been publicly reported that the Eastern District was investigating the Kushner Company’s use of the EB-5 visa program – which essentially rewards wealth foreign investors for investing in the US – Deutsche Bank wasn’t involved in any of the projects where Kushner Company partners had received EB-5 visas.

The Brooklyn United States attorney has been investigating the Kushner businesses’ use of a program known as EB-5. It offers visas to overseas investors in exchange for $500,00 investments in real estate projects. But Deutsche Bank does not appear to have been involved in Kushner real estate projects financed through the EB-5 program. That suggests the prosecutors’ subpoena may be unrelated to the visa program.

Trump’s lawyers confirmed that Mueller hasn’t subpoenaed any Deutsche Bank records related to Trump, his business or his children.

Deutsche Bank is also a big lender to Mr. Trump’s companies, though Mr. Mueller has not subpoenaed the bank for information about those accounts, according to people familiar with subpoenas that Deutsche Bank has received. Mr. Trump’s lawyers have said publicly that they have been assured that Mr. Mueller has not subpoenaed bank records related to him or his family. People close to Mr. Kushner, who declined to be named, said they do not think he is in jeopardy from Nr. Mueller’s investigation.

The Kushner Companies received requests for information pertaining to two New Jersey developments from the Eastern District before Deutsche had received the subpoena, according to the Times.

Given the deluge of premeditated leaks pertaining to the Mueller probe meant to shake out the president’s inner circle, it’s perhaps not surprising that reporters have gotten a few things wrong. It may be worth keeping this in mind the next time the WaPo/NYT (ex Glenn Thrush going forward)/CNN circle of friends publish an anonymously sourced story about nefarious activities related to the top KGB agent, one Donald Trump.

759,864,South Africa Lays Formal Demands On The W.H. After Trump Called Continent A ‘Sh*thole’,"It turns out that insulting an entire continent may have severe diplomatic ramifications. Trump has long been shielded from any consequences to his racist and xenophobic statements, but now that he is President, he’s finding himself the center of world condemnation.

Last week during a bipartisan meeting on immigration, Trump derided immigrants from Africa and Haiti, saying (via The Chicago Tribune):

‘Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?’

The White House immediately tried to muddy the waters by moving the focus to Trump’s specific word choice:

White House official told me tonight there is debate internally on whether Trump said ""shithole"" or ""shithouse."" Perdue and Cotton seem to have heard latter, this person said, and are using to deny. — Josh Dawsey (@jdawsey1) January 15, 2018

And American’s aren’t falling for it:

The “shithole” vs. “shithouse” and the “I” vs. “I’d” are both equally fucking dumb debates and potential differences without distinctions and if you’re wasting time on this, retire — Asawin Suebsaeng (@swin24) January 15, 2018

The issue at the heart of the matter is not simply Trump’s vulgarity, but the complete lack of empathy that this comment signifies. His comment was not merely describing the standard of living in African countries (and Haiti), he was connecting those conditions with the worthiness of the countries’ citizens.

Immediately after Trump’s comments, a huge number of political figures in the U.S. urged Trump to remember that all people deserve respect and dignity, no matter their country of origin.

Former president Bill Clinton challenged Trump’s remarks:

I’ve traveled and worked in Haiti, and across Africa and Central America. The countries the president described with his epithet do not exist. Some thoughts as we remember those lost in Haiti eight years ago today: https://t.co/iXJwEAo2f6 — Bill Clinton (@BillClinton) January 12, 2018

Sen. Dick Durbin, who was present for the remark, shared his thoughts:

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, (the very senator that Trump implied offered sexual favors in exchange for his campaign donation), gave a strong admonition:

A repulsive, unacceptable remark, far beneath the dignity of the presidency. Our country is better than this. https://t.co/U54NdZ9Dgz — Kirsten Gillibrand (@SenGillibrand) January 12, 2018

From Sen. Dianne Feinstein:

We all need to stop pretending that there are no consequences when the most powerful person in the world espouses racist views and gives a wink and a nod to the darkest elements in our society. — Sen Dianne Feinstein (@SenFeinstein) January 13, 2018

Even staunch Republicans are speaking out against the racist remark.

Republican Rep. Mia Love:

""The president must apologize to both the American people and the nations he so wantonly maligned,"" said Representative Mia Love, a Republican of Utah https://t.co/RjQZaN8OrB — The New York Times (@nytimes) January 12, 2018

Republican Senator Jeff Flake:

The words used by the President, as related to me directly following the meeting by those in attendance, were not “tough,” they were abhorrent and repulsive. — Jeff Flake (@JeffFlake) January 12, 2018

Former RNC chair Michael Steele:

Former Republican Party chair: Trump is a racist, the evidence is incontrovertible. pic.twitter.com/juJ4ZqVv3k — John Aravosis (@aravosis) January 12, 2018

Republican Senator Susan Collins:

These comments are highly inappropriate & out of bounds and could hurt efforts for a bipartisan immigration agreement. The President should not denigrate other countries. — Sen. Susan Collins (@SenatorCollins) January 12, 2018

Republican Senator Lindsey Graham reportedly confronted Trump about the remark. According to Sen. Dick Durbin, Graham (via Axios):

‘Spoke up and made a direct comment on what the president said.’

The initial response from African leaders was swift. On Friday morning, the African Union issued a reaction (via CNN):

‘The African Union Mission wishes to express its infuriation, disappointment and outrage over the unfortunate comment made by Mr. Donald Trump, President of the United States of America, which remarks dishonor the celebrated American creed and respect for diversity and human dignity.’

Trump has yet to take responsibility for his comments, spending his energy claiming that he is not a racist (via Axios):

‘I’m not a racist. I’m the least racist person you will ever interview.’

Do “not-a-racists” say things like this?

About Haitians (via New York Magazine):

‘They all have AIDS.’

About Mexican immigrants (via The Washington Post):

‘They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.’

About black people (via Slate):

‘Besides that, I’ve got to tell you something else. I think that guy is lazy. And it’s probably not his fault because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It’s not anything they can control….Don’t you agree?’

About white supremacists (via The Atlantic):

‘You also had some very fine people on both sides.’

Do “not-a-racists” think things like this?

That all welfare recipients are black (via Newsweek):

In the spring of 2017, the newly elected president met with members of the Congressional Black Caucus. During that meeting, one of the members mentioned to Trump that welfare reform would be detrimental to her constituents— adding, ‘Not all of whom are black.’ The president was incredulous. Really? Then what are they?’

That Nigerian immigrants all live in huts (via Business Insider):

President Donald Trump reportedly grew enraged at a June meeting over the amount of visas awarded to travelers from certain countries, grumbling … that the 40,000 Nigerian visitors would never ‘go back to their huts’ in Africa.

His complete inability to apologize has led to more structured diplomatic actions.

The South African government has issued a statement, demanding that the United States explain Trump’s “disturbing comments”:

The Department will provide an opportunity to the Charges de Affaires to explain the statement that African countries, alongside Haiti and El Savador, constitute ‘shitholes’ from where migrants into the United States are undesirable.

Though it’s tempting to view South Africa’s most recent response as merely a more strongly worded objection to Trump’s racism, it’s important to remember that this action, formally called a démarche, is well-established and official diplomatic process.

This means that the South African government demands a response from our State Department. Hopefully, this diplomatic escalation will motivate a government-wide movement to formally hold Trump accountable for his actions.

Via Nicholas Colas of DataTrekResearch,

Tis the season for predictions… In fact, it seems to us that the requisite crystal ball gazing gets more popular every year. A nice compact list of bite-sized thoughts makes for easy social media sharing, after all.

But the really interesting thing to us is not “What” a person or organization predicts, but rather two other factors. First, how many different prognosticators agree on a given topic? Second, how do they all come to their conclusions?

We have spent the last few days combing through the year-end predictions from a wide array of brokerage firms, consultancies, and other sources.

What follows is a “Top 10 list” of the best of those. We have annotated each to highlight the important points, and included links so you can read them for yourself. There are many predictions in each full report we could not summarize efficiently, and each one merits a quick skim if you have the time.

With that introduction, the list:

#1): You don’t need to be a Goldman Sachs client to read a comprehensive summary of their very positive case for global economic growth in 2018. The only problem in translating that into a bullish stance on stocks: they see the US Federal Reserve tightening monetary policy much more aggressively than market expectations. Even still, however, they still expect global interest rates to remain low.

http://www.goldmansachs.com/our-thinking/pages/macroeconomic-insights-folder/2018-global-economic-outlook-as-good-as-it-gets/report.pdf

#2) From AT Kearney (who had a pretty good run with their 2017 predictions): expect more regulatory pressure on US Tech giants (a concern we share), a tougher than expected final Brexit negotiation, and a breakthrough in quantum computing. That last one is a very important call for technology – Moore’s Law won’t keep working forever. Quantum computing is the answer, but it has been an elusive solution so far.

https://www.atkearney.com/web/global-business-policy-council/article?/a/year-ahead-predictions-2018

#3): From Accenture, a splash of cold water for those who think self-driving cars are just around the corner: “Fully autonomous cars will not come in 2018”. They do, however, see value in blockchain technology to secure the data transfer between passenger vehicles and dealerships, factory, and IT solutions.

https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insight-perspectives-auto-predictions

#4) From Deloitte: “More than a billion smartphone users will create augmented reality content at least once in 2018”. What’s augmented reality? Remember the Pokemon smartphone game that overlaid cartoon characters on your screen? That’s AR. But just imagine being able to shop for a new sofa or TV console and see how it would look in your living room, all right on your smartphone screen in real time. That’s AR, too.

https://venturebeat.com/2017/12/11/deloittes-tech-predictions-for-2018-more-ai-digital-subscriptions-ar-and-live-events/

#5) A very thoughtful prediction piece from TechCrunch agrees with the AR point above, and also thinks:

Competition between providers of streaming content will only accelerate, and Apple will enter the fray more aggressively.

A breakthrough year for Siri and Alexa as Apple and Amazon start to monetize these Trojan Horses with advertising and shopping suggestions for users.

https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/04/ten-predictions-for-digital-media-in-2018/

#6) Still on the mobile technology theme, App Annie (a research firm in the space) notes that 2018 is the 10th anniversary of the Apple App Store, and predicts:

Consumers will continue to download and use new video streaming apps, further fragmenting content consumption.

Physical retail stores will increasingly become order pickup locations for customers who order on their mobile device but want an item right away.

https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/predictions-app-economy-2018/

#7) From health care investors Venrock: “Amazon will not shake up pharmacy benefits managers.” They also expect another health care unicorn to fail in 2018 (as Theranos did this year), hospital hiring to slow (bad for macro job growth), and Anthem, Humana, Cigna, and Optum to all “Aggressively acquire higher margin, less regulated businesses”.

https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/27/venrocks-health-investors-make-predictions-for-2018.html

#8) Aetna’s Global President of Population Health puts undiagnosed diabetes on the same list as better-known problems like opioid addiction and mental health. And while not strictly a 2018 prediction, Dr. Sneh Khemka notes that a rapidly expanding global middle class is straining health care systems around the world. Lifestyle related diseases are “In”; infectious diseases are “out”.

https://www.imtj.com/articles/health-trends-and-predictions-2018/

9) Will it still be President Trump in December 2018? Yes, with a 69% chance according to Predictit.org. If that doesn’t sound especially high to you, we tend to agree.

https://www.predictit.org/Contract/5367/Will-Donald-Trump-be-president-at-year-end-2018#data

10) And which political party will control the House after midterm elections? (Drum roll, please)… Predictit.org gives the odds to the Democrats, at 62%. We think this is an underappreciated market risk for next year. Midterm elections strongly favor the party that doesn’t hold the White House. What happens to US equities as the market starts to discount a return to gridlock?

5130,5808,Why Is Alphabet CEO Eric Schmidt Technically Serving In The Department Of Defense?,"Why Is Alphabet CEO Eric Schmidt Technically Serving In The Department Of Defense?

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

Authored by Eric Lieberman via The Daily Caller,

Eric Schmidt, chief executive of Google parent company Alphabet, was appointed chairman of a Department of Defense program in 2016 that was established by former President Barack Obama’s administration.

A staunch supporter of the Democratic Party and critic of President Donald Trump, Schmidt still continues to lead the Defense Innovation Board (DIB), even well after the new administration took over in January. This begs the question: should Schmidt’s history of partisan advocacy and condemnation of Trump be a worrisome prospect for the current White House?

Regardless of the answer, Trump’s retention of Schmidt may be emblematic of more than political divisiveness within the current administration, like from “Obama holdovers.” In fact, it may be the opposite of unwanted internal discord and a sign of an underlying ethos for the Trump administration — diversity of thought.

“When you look at the composition of the initial Economic Advisory Board, it kind of reminds me of what Trump is doing here,” Justin Danhof, general counsel of the National Center for Public Policy Research and director of the Free Enterprise Project, told The Daily Caller News Foundation. “He’s putting together a team of rivals. If you want to get to the best ideas, you can’t have everyone in the room thinking the same thing.”

Alphabet announced on Thursday that Schmidt will be stepping down in January, marking the seeming end to a 17-year-career at Google and its parent company. It’s quite likely that he will maintain economic and personal interests in the business, especially since he’s expected to stay on as a member of Alphabet’s board of directors and serve as an adviser.

The DIB was formally created in March 2016, and former Secretary of Defense Ash Carter later announced that Schmidt would be heading the organization. Other specifically chosen board members include famous astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman, Wharton School of Business professor Dr. Adam Grant, Instagram COO Marne Levine, University of Texas chancellor and former Special Operations Command commander Navy Adm. William McRaven, among several others.

Some, like David Williams, president of the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, saw Schmidt’s taking of the helm as somewhat disconcerting given the “open-door policy” the Obama administration allegedly had with one of the country’s most powerful companies.

“There needs to be a massive amount of oversight with this Board,” Williams told TheDCNF. “If the DOD is contemplating new technology to address a new defense need, will it be skewed toward a technology that benefits Google or one of the companies? Massive potential for conflicts of interest with real taxpayer implications.”

And it’s not just personal business affairs that are concerning to some — Schmidt’s own brand of politics could conceivably come into play, whether intentionally or subconsciously. He was spotted wearing a staff badge during then-Democratic candidate for president Hillary Clinton’s election night party. Not long after, Schmidt reportedly told an audience of employees that Trump is “going to do these evil things as they’ve done in the immigration area and perhaps some others.”

In correlation with his statements to employees, Alphabet also reportedly spearheaded the funding efforts for the legal brief signed by nearly 100 companies that objected to Trump’s temporary immigration ban.

But due to the work of the DIB — which mainly centers around projects like modernizing military bases and ensuring defense systems are sufficiently up to date — it appears that personal politics likely has a minimal impact.

“The Defense Innovation Board is focused on supporting the Department of Defense on issues, such as AI, data analytics, software acquisition, and shaping the culture of the DOD workforce. These issues know no partisan boundaries,” Navy Cmdr. Patrick Evans, who does press operations for the Pentagon, told TheDCNF. “DOD cares about enhancing lethality, strengthening alliances and partnerships, and reforming the Department. DIB is about advancing the Department and serving the American public, not politics.”

Google declined to comment on the record and referred TheDCNF to the DOD for any statements or insight.

A top representative for Google was sure to add, though, that Schmidt serves on the board in a personal respect, separate from his work at Alphabet or its subsidiaries.

Conversely, Schmidt could arguably be more than a good fit for the DIB given its overarching goals.

The program “seeks to advise the department on areas that are deeply familiar to Silicon Valley companies, such as rapid prototyping, iterative product development, complex data analysis in business decision making, and organizational information sharing,” Evans explains. “Then-Secretary Carter selected the board to represent a cross-section of America’s most innovative industries, drawing on technical and management expertise from across the country.”

Furthermore, Alphabet is a tech conglomerate that, along with other functions, serves as a corporate umbrella for several subsidiaries including Google. Most notably, Alphabet includes X lab, which serves as an incubator for startups, meaning the larger holding company also acts as a hub for technological research and development.

Williams says that “the idea of the DIB isn’t a bad one” because updating the government’s services and infrastructure is needed.

“The only concern is that there’s too much of an emphasis on tinkering rather than fundamental reforms, like ending big failing spending programs,” he added, implying that innovation may distract from more necessary changes, like deep cuts to costly expenditures.

Danhof says the DIB is a great idea, even with the prospect of it backfiring for Trump if board members resign out of political protest.

“If you think about how laggard the U.S. government is when it comes to innovation and technology breakthroughs, if you look at the backlog that’s at the VA [Department of Veteran Affairs], if Eric Schmidt could do even one thing to improve something like that, then I think that this should be cheered as a great success,” Danhof asserted. “President Trump should be cheered for thinking outside the box and going with someone who has spoken out against him, who is a political rival in a sense in that he supports the other party full lock, stock, and barrel. Trump is willing to look past all of that to try to find the best people to help this government operate better.”

While also commending Obama for the board’s creation, Danhof said having Schmidt stay on the board is a true sign of Trump’s acute business acumen since any good business operator or owner doesn’t hire people merely because they think the same way and are likable.

“You hire someone who’s the best person for the job,” Danhof continued. “If it’s how we technologically innovate, why wouldn’t you think of one of the founders of Google, even if he is against you in almost everything you say, think, or do in a political standpoint?”

6330,7244,"Hi-Ho, Hi-Ho, Off the Cliff we Go!","Like blind pigs led to slaughter, the entitlement generation in America is staring right down the double barrel of doom and gloom, watching other nations leap off the same cliff they are headed for, and still, they remain unable to connect the dots in order to save themselves.

The tangled web of lies we have worked so hard for so many years to weave, now ensnares the very people who erected this house of cards and as we rocket towards the cliff, the average American citizen seems none the wiser despite increasing signs from around the globe that this cannot end well for anyone.

In my recent column - Greece Today—USA Tomorrow - Under Obama—I might have understated America’s position in the timeline of events that will most likely end with the utter collapse of pretty much every nation on earth, including the good ole USA.

At the time, I believed that the USA was months behind Greece in the impending economic collapse category. Now I see that the USA might be only days or weeks behind Greece in this regard as the same folks responsible for the collapse all over the globe begin to behave just like their brethren in Greece, right here in American cities.

Citizens have lost their collective minds. Before we can begin an education process, say, Economics 101—You Can’t Spend More Than You Make, - we must first put the people through a deprogramming effort.

As I have told my children since youth, ignorance is the lack of information which is easily cured by a dramatic increase in needed information. But stupidity is something quite different, for which there is no cure.

Time to Connect the Dots

As Democrat New York Governor David Patterson sought to feather the nests of his closest aides and allies with lavish pay increases topping 29%, he was pushing for a furlough of 100,000 state employees in an emergency effort to keep New York state from bellying up under the weight of excessive government waste in one of the highest taxed states in the country.

Of course Government Employee Labor Unions were furious, taking to the streets of New York like Greek union thugs, threatening to make the streets of New York look like the streets of Athens if someone didn’t step in and stop Patterson from putting 100,000 state workers on the unemployment line.

In rides the knight in shining armor on silver steed, a federal court judge who immediately issues a stay blocking New York from laying off 100,000 workers on the basis of—“it wasn’t collectively bargained”—which means, the labor union objects…and on that basis alone, one man stopped the state of New York, its elected Governor and the state legislature from balancing their own budget before going belly up. End analysis?—Where did states’ rights go?

Where will that federal judge be when New York payroll checks bounce?

Meanwhile, one must ask, since government jobs are taxpayer funded, why do we even have public sector labor unions which can hold taxpayers hostage under thug collective bargaining rules, perpetually increasing the cost of government to the detriment of every taxpayer, until we hit the bottom of the resource well?

Many other US cities and states are in the same position as New York. Since we now think federal legal precedent is the new supreme law of our land, this judge single handedly established that no city or state has the right to self-govern, unless they clear it with labor union thugs first.

The Root of All Evil

Above all others, four groups are responsible for the complete destruction of our nation and nations around the globe.

Public Sector Labor Unions

Lawyers & Law Professors

Public Communications Industry

Money Changers & Currency Traders

Over the last ten years alone, Public Sector Labor Unions have invested over $187 million in American politicians (policy makers), over 91% of it to Democrats. The Public Communications Industry that forms public opinion by way of information flow has given over $800 million to American policy makers, more than 60% of it to Democrats.

Lawyers are the single largest financial supporters of today’s Democrats, having given more than $1.2 billion to policy makers over the last ten years, more than 71% of it to Democrats.

Money changers, currency traders in particular, those responsible for wrecking currencies all over the globe, like George Soros, have invested more than $41.5 million in policy makers over the last ten years, more than 65% of it with Democrats.

As a result, Democrats are in charge of all branches of the federal government today and they are bankrupting the nation via the Poison Ivy League Cloward-Piven Strategy for forcing global socialism upon all civilized nations, especially the United States of America, the world’s most productive society.

Money changers are raking in billions in profits as currencies all over the world are destroyed, and pouring some of those profits into Democrat policy makers who make it all possible.

Lawyers are engaged in subverting the US Constitution instead of upholding and defending the rule of law, so that the American people have no clue what their real rights are anymore or where they can seek peaceful legal redress of issues of increasing concern.

The labor unions are bankrupting cities, states, and the federal government from sea to shining sea and the Public Communication system makes certain that no American can connect all of these dots.

Moments of Sanity Largely Ignored

Occasionally, a glimmer of truth slips through the cracks…MUST READ moments of reality that society cannot afford to miss.

It’s a law of nature, what goes up must come down. You cannot spend what you don’t have for very long before nobody will pick up your tab anymore.

In Greece, the streets of New York, Chicago, LA and Michigan, labor union thugs increase the sometimes violent demand for more and more from a public trough run dry. To answer their demands, government must simply print more currency to cover payroll that can be covered no other way at present.

Then, the tax increases you were told won’t happen, MUST happen…

Once Tax & Spend—Now Spend and Tax

The taxes taken in over the years were spent decades ago. It took the USA seventy years to go from zero national debts to $10 trillion in debt. But it has taken the Obama administration only eighteen months in power to increase national debt by 40% to almost $14 trillion, not counting any of the unfunded social-justice promises made to secure a fraudulent election.

In the good old days, we taxed first and then spent. Today, we spend first then figure out how to tax.

Tax we must or Collapse we will!

If a federal court will not allow New York State to cut spending because it offends all important labor unions that fund the Democrat Party, New York will have only two options left. Shut down the state government, or borrow more printed debt from the Fed to kick the can a little further down the road.

Many other cities and states are in the exact same condition, forced into that economic corner by pro-union and pro-social justice federal policies that make it an act of racism not to keep the gravy train rolling.

Greece has already hit this wall, as has Iceland. Portugal, Spain and Italy are only days behind them, which is why the EU and IMF put up a trillion in fake currency to rescue Greece from its $100 billion disaster. There are more disasters coming…

This is why the Euro is in real danger of collapse. Yet the dollar and all other currencies are still following behind, with the exception of the United Kingdom which has just now seen the light, putting conservatives in control of their government for the first time since Margaret Thatcher, before London looks like Athens.

Maybe British citizens remembered what Thatcher was famous for saying…“Socialism is a good idea until you run out of other people’s money…” (I paraphrase)

What are Americans Thinking?

Well, according to a recent Rasmussen poll, 53% of American citizens think public sector labor unions are a good idea. Maybe this represents the 53% of citizens who really don’t pay any federal income taxes and therefore, cannot feel the pinch of the Cloward-Piven Strategy personally yet?

They see what’s happening in Greece on their TV screens, but they don’t understand why it’s happening and how it relates to where America is headed in the coming days and weeks, as city after city, state after state reach the bottom of the barrel with no way to clear government payroll checks.

Most Americans instinctively hate lawyers, but few know why they should.

Most Americans know that they are being lied to by their press, but they are so accustomed to it that they know not what to do about it.

The Simple Solution

End our nation of lawyers and return to a nation of laws—nobody can even understand what lawyers write today, and that’s by intent. They plan to make it up as they go in court anyway. End ALL public sector labor unions and do away with union bid only contracts—government jobs should be lower paying “government service” positions, for people interested in “serving the people,” not getting rich. End currency speculation and profiteering by the manipulation and destruction of entire economies by hedge fund thugs. Force news agencies to become the eyes and ears of the people again, and hold them directly accountable for failing to report the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

The 100,000 furloughed government employees should be private sector employees operating under government bid contracts in the first place. No union needed. The contractor who delivers the best product for the best price wins the contract.

Thanks to unions, lawyers, international currency thugs, a corrupt news media and Democrats, our nation is on the edge of the cliff and only reversing course in these areas will pull us back from the abyss.

We can do this the easy way or the hard way…We can do it while we still have options on the table, or do it when there are no other options on the table. I prefer an organized controlled disaster over an uncontrollable free-fall from greatness.

But make no mistake - we will do it sooner or later. Like Greece, we will soon have no other choice.",http://canadafreepress.com/article/hi-ho-hi-ho-off-the-cliff-we-go,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

Although a wonderful proclamation for the Christmas season, to consider our country in peace and/or good will towards others, in my humble opinion, is about two clicks from impossible this day, as we turn the page on 2017 with our hopes and prayers for a better 2018.



As many of you, I love and respect the positive attitude and courage of our President Donald J. Trump, and getting his tax reform bill through congress was a major win for him and hopefully for the entire country. But, and unfortunately, that is a huge ‘but’ with everything surrounding the Trump presidency, as if he were on his tippy-toes being held in a choke hold, with little room to breathe.

Today, I am thankful, grateful and blessed as an individual with a wonderful, loving and heathy family (and smart too..;). And on this day, I would also like to take the opportunity as I do each year to thank my NYPD partner Mike for his contribution to our collective efforts in that old police adage of making sure we each went home safely at the end of each tour.

But, the truth be told, there is little to be thankful for outside of my personal world of family and friends, where this year everywhere feels different: as an individual, as a father, as an American, as a former US Marine, as an NRA firearms instructor, and believe that although we should always be thankful for the blessings that the Good Lord has bestowed upon the people of this exceptional nation, it is equally as important a time for a reality check and for preparation.

Because if they do, then they should fire everyone responsible for the degree of bumbling PR this event has caused their agencies; unless of course what the American people think is totally irrelevant to them.

There is such divisiveness in the United States of America today, you’d think that someone, or some organization(s) were actually fanning the flames of hostility by investing large sums of money to fund this enormous amount of hatred being stirred up between our fellow Americans, simply because one group protests under the guise of social injustices that must! be corrected and the other side disagreeing with their un-American methods of grandstanding. And, if you thought that, you would be right! The NFL kneeling protest has been anything but a spontaneous event by black athletes, who once again are being used as nothing more than pawns—pawns in a much larger game than they will ever know.

On August 28, 2017, the US Supreme Court Docketed No. 17-280 a RICO case against Governor Chris Christie and included as defendants: legislators, judges and police chiefs, which understandably is a major reward for the little man for the many battles he has fought to date; but, the war for our Constitutional right of self-protection is far from over, and your help by signing our petition below is now needed.

It was on September 29, 1959 as I began my freshman year of High School, that the Russian dictator Nikita Khrushchev warned the Americans citizenry in no uncertain terms:

“Your children’s children will live under communism. You Americans are so gullible. No, you won’t accept Communism outright, but we’ll keep feeding you small doses of Socialism until you finally wake up and find that you already have Communism. We won’t have to fight you; we’ll so weaken your economy, until you will fall like overripe fruit into our hands.”

“In the Name of the Father and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit…”



Blessing myself, with these words and signs in Christian prayer, I began my speech at a Tea Party Rally in Jackson, New Jersey in the summer of 2009. On an interesting note, not knowing whether or not I was Preacher up on that stage, nearly half of the 3,000 or so patriots in that open field, blessed themselves along with me.



I went on in prayer saying, “Dearly Beloved! We are gathered here today to remember the United Sta…tes…Oh Wait! What is this I’m reading? We seem to be having technical difficulties with my teleprompter…excuse me…Ah! Ah!...”

At 12:00 noon, today, January 20th, in the year of Lord, 2017, President Donald J. Trump became the 45th President of the United States of America.

His inaugural address was presented in classic Trump style, when he confirmed “...today, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another, or from one [political] party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington, DC and giving it back to YOU, The People.”

Author’s note: The original title of this year-end missive had the word ‘cautiously’ preceding Trumpful; and not that we are suggesting that we throw caution to the wind, but today we celebrate and give thanks, and we will deal with tomorrow…

During this season of Thanksgiving, Christmas and the new beginnings of a New Year, we Americans have much to be Trumpful for. And, for the first time in a very long time, as Ronald Reagan optimistically told us, “It is Morning once again in America!”

This is a time, not only for Americans to join hands, but for the entire free world to come together in Thanksgiving, to thank the Good Lord for bringing us President-Elect Donald Trump (for those words are music to our ears).

The Donald lost no time in making one of his shrewdest executive decisions, knowing that Governor Chris Christie was fully aware of the George Washington Bridgegate scandal, and according to the New York Post, “Trump thought it was shameful that Christie didn’t take the fall for [convicted aide] Bridget Kelly,” a source told the paper. “Trump is really angry that Christie is sending a soccer mom to jail. He believes one hundred percent that Christie was behind it all.”

This missive is being written more for the women, to include my sister Mary, who said she was voting with her heart for Hillary. And, I would also like to include our female neighbors who have said unequivocally that ‘Hillary is my girl’.

And, as the women know, there are also a great number of men who agree that it’s about time we tried it with a woman at the helm, saying, “Look how the men have screwed things up, so far.” And, yes for as many seconds as there are in a day, I wholeheartedly agree.

For the sake of brevity, let’s say as an instructor for the lifelong sport I am experienced in, I find women to be ten times more educable than men. Women actually listen to an instructor, so they might in turn learn something. And, might I offer somewhat in jest: unlike many of us men, women do not already know everything.

There is a level of fear, anger, and frustration in this country that is the polar opposite of the typical American, known worldwide for our ‘Can Do’ attitude.

We now understand why Hillary wondered, “Why am I not winning by 50%”, knowing as we awake each morning with additional proof of the Clinton corruption with the emails from Wikileaks and Project Veritas covert videos explaining their specific plans to bus-in illegal voters to multiple polling places, voting machines with untraceable software that will switch our ‘legal votes’ for Trump to Clinton. We have come to realize how each of these actions peels back the true depths of criminality that the Obama Administration, the DNC and the Clinton campaign will go to in order to steal this election; and wonder sometimes ourselves how is Trump still standing.

The hour is late and time is of the essence. They obviously have their well-oiled plan in place and ready to be implemented. And, as you will see, we too have a plan for “defending freedom in its maximum hour of danger.” Please note the author of this quote is also a main player in The Plan.

I have laid out The Plan here which will take only one very courageous FBI Investigator to read and convince eleven others for safety in numbers, and then to act upon it. Before reading this, I am sure you already know exactly who the other 11 agents are. But, as you review this plan, please do not brush this off as some foolish coincidence, for He has offered His Hand where you hold one of the only Trump Cards, and you know it.

Hillary Parkinson’s Clinton is lying! This statement is akin to saying that she is breathing; and sadly, the only way in which she will stop, is when she can no longer - breathe.

Lying has always been a winning strategy for Hillary, and as one might imagine, blatantly lying is a major requirement for every associate of the Clintonista, where each individual is obligated to remain silent or worse is coerced into repeating her fictitious stories themselves. This obvious group includes her close aids, doctors, lawyers, and literally anyone who comes in contact with her or him (him, because we can’t forget her partner-in-crime, who is not known as Slick Willie for nothing). Many sheep-like-Americans have become so accustomed to the continuance of her lies by the liberal-biased mainstream media about anything related to Crooked Hillary Clinton, that they can no longer recognize, nor care about—the truth. And as you know, her well-worn tactic has been quite successful, because lying has gotten her to the doorstep of their ultimate goal, the one with limitless power, the one that will make all their sins of the past go away—the presidency of the United States, as it clearly did for their predecessor.

Liberals are stupid. It’s not that they’re not clever or good in science or math. It’s not that can’t excel at writing or philosophy or chess. They can play the game but they can’t understand it.

Liberals are pencils that draw the lines between two points but can’t see the whole page. They are typical of lost children who can’t see the forest for the trees.

Liberals direct society towards death by not punishing crime to the point of discouragement, by committing abortion on trimester embryos, by practicing reverse racism by siding with Black Lives Matter. They are the supporters of the racist blacks who beat an old man over the head with his oxygen tank in Ferguson.

Hillary calls Trump’s followers a basket of deplorables. It’s actually more like an Easter basket of serious, self-reliant people who want to make America great. Trump is giving Easter egg gifts to the world by freeing us from Obama’s stupid Muslim sympathy and returning us to Judeo-Christian rule.

Obama has never had an original thought in his head. What he does is take traditional thoughts and turn them around. Thus he uses American reliable thoughts as a springboard for contrarian thought. Nothing original here, just trampolining off historical thought by doing summersaults of nonsense in the air.

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

President Donald Trump released a new national security plan on Monday which reverses much of the Obama doctrine. Central to the Trump plan is taking the fight to terrorists in the Middle East. You know, so we don’t have to fight them here.

The Trump plan can only be responsibly described as an unimaginative re-start of the Bush Doctrine responsible for setting the Middle Eastern world on fire decades ago when George H.W. Bush first allowed Dick Cheney to sharpen his foreign policy fangs on unsuspecting people across the world.

When the senior Bush lost his second election to Bill Clinton, the Bush Doctrine faded ever so slightly. But it never went away.

And then the Bush Dynasty re-entered power with the election of George W. Bush, fully engaging the world in Middle Eastern affairs once again.

Never forget how Bush the younger wanted so badly the opportunity to blame the 9-11 terror attacks on his father’s old foe Saddam Hussein.

After the U.S. tore apart Afghanistan in search of the terrorists we were all told were responsible for the 9-11 attacks, Bush saw his opportunity to jump into Iraq. And so he told us they had scary weapons of mass destruction.

We never saw the weapons. And we never saw Osama bin Laden’s corpse.

But we’ve been told we’re all safer now.

Barack Obama’s tenure in the White House marked another cooling period for the Bush Doctrine. Not because his administration actually followed through on promises to disengage the U.S. from Mideast fighting– but because the blood opportunists he worked for had other interests in touching up U.S. hegemony by meddling in the affairs of the Libyan and Syrian people.

Trump pointed all of this out during his campaign for president, questioning why the U.S. would continue expending military energy in places where we have nothing to gain.

But he’s now changed his tune.

Today’s Trump is just another guy in the White House warning us all about a faceless and totally amorphous band of terrorists in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya and Syria.

At this point, the fine details of the plan don’t really matter all that much– only that, yes, American soldiers and military equipment will be remaining in the Mideast indefinitely.

We’re going to arm some “good guys,” blow up some bad ones, help to displace a whole lot of people and keep talking about what a shame it is these folks don’t realize how nice it would be to have a McDonald’s on every corner.

No matter how many “leaders” you never heard of we kill, more will rise up to take their place.

And radicalization will continue. And so will terror attacks.

It almost seems like there was a reason the guys who set this whole thing up wanted us to stay home, be farmers and point the guns outward.

8210,9303,New Study Reveals The Real Reason Why Smart People Are Better Off Alone,"Source: www.learning-mind.com | Original Post Date: March 23, 2016 –

If you’re intelligent, you’re better off alone.

At least, that’s what a recent study in the British Journal of Psychology claims. The question that evolutionary psychologists Kanazawa and Li were looking to answer is what makes a life well-lived and how intelligence, population density and friendship can affect our happiness.

The psychologists theorized that the lifestyle of our ancient ancestors form the basis of what makes us happy in modern times, “Situations and circumstances that would have increased our ancestors’ life satisfaction in the ancestral environment may still increase our life satisfaction today.” Their study was carried out on 15,000 adults aged between 18 – 28 and their results weren’t actually all that surprising.

Firstly, their findings showed that people who lived in more densely populated areas were less satisfied with their life in general, compared to those who live in less populated areas. The second finding that the psychologists discovered was that the more social a person is with their close friends, the greater they said their happiness was. But there was an exception. These correlations were diminished or even reversed when the results of intelligent people were analyzed. In other words – when smart people spend time with their friends, it makes them less happy.

Why would intelligent people not gain happiness when they’re around close family and friends? There may be many explanations, including this one, given by Carol Graham, a researcher who studies the economics of happiness,

“The findings in here suggest (and it is no surprise) that those with more intelligence and the capacity to use it … are less likely to spend so much time socializing because they are focused on some other longer term objective.“

This generally makes sense since those intelligent people are so focused on achieving their intellectual goals, anything that takes away from those ambitions makes them unhappy.

The modern day human life has changed rapidly since our ancestors’ time and with technological advances rapidly improving, there may be a kind of mismatch between our brains and the way our bodies are designed to handle situations, according to Kanazawa and Li.

So there we have it. We thought that human interaction would make people happier, but it turns out intelligent people are better off alone. What do you think of these recent findings? Do you agree or disagree? Let us know in the comments.

By Brandon Smith

The temptation to revel in the implosion of the extreme political Left is high, and it’s understandable. I could go through a long list of insane offenses by the cultural Marxist cult of the church of “social justice,” but I think this latest example summarizes the problem nicely. In this video, teaching assistant Lindsay Shepard at Wilfred Laurier University in Canada is reprimanded and brow beaten by two professors for daring to commit the heresy of showing her students BOTH sides of the debate over transgenderism and pronoun politics.

The zealotry on display here by these professors is indicative of a deep-rooted cancer within the Left. Shepard was not attempting to troll her class with misinformation or subtly manipulate them with propaganda, in fact she wasn’t seeking to pressure them to support either viewpoint. She was not violating anyone’s private property rights to assail them with her arguments, either. Her only goal was to show people in a public space that there are in fact at least two opposing viewpoints on the issue in question. But in a cult it is unacceptable to acknowledge that there are different ways of thinking from the prevailing doctrine. Other beliefs and evidence must be filtered out completely, otherwise, the devout members of the cult might be faced with uncertainty.

If an ideological system is so fragile that it cannot tolerate the slightest hint of legitimate counter-evidence, then something is very wrong with that system. If that system is incapable of arguing its merits using facts and instead relies on the argument of “How dare you!,” the only things that could possibly keep it alive are threats of force and terror.

Decades ago, it was the “Christian Right” that was often attacked as being too puritanical and theocratic in its attempts to not only control politics and legislation, but to also control the public mindset. They were not satisfied by merely dictating the laws; they wanted individual people to believe the way they believed, or at least act like it for the sake of conformity. This caused a considerable backlash from the general populace, and over time the image of the rest of Christianity suffered because of the overreach of an aggressive and often self-contradicting and hypocritical contingent.

The social justice cult is running into the same conundrum today. The backlash is reaching epic proportions and the term “SJW” is becoming a household joke, when only a year ago most people had no clue what an SJW was — all they knew was that “political correctness” was furiously taking over Hollywood, the internet, politics, etc.

Most people do not like zealots, no matter what side of the political spectrum they claim to come from. And, whenever zealotry poisons a social movement and causes it to violate the non-aggression principle, there is always a reaction in the other direction from the citizenry. You cannot force people to believe what you believe, to think the way you think or to speak the way you want them to speak.

The laws of social physics at least partially explain the current collapse of the Left. However, I believe there is another underlying agenda taking place here, and it is working to the detriment of all people, regardless of their political affiliations.

In my article “Order Out Of Chaos: The Defeat Of The Left Comes With A cost,” published just after Donald Trump’s election win, I warned of the potential danger that the Left is being exploited by the establishment as a sacrificial appendage, a tool used to push conservatives to their own extremes and their own zealotry. Meaning, conservatives could be manipulated into embracing government power and totalitarianism in order to crush the zealotry of the cultural marxists. Essentially, we would become monsters in order to defeat monsters.

The next stage in this theater of fourth-generation warfare would be for the Left to hit rock bottom and then rise again from the ashes as something new, and entirely more dangerous.

So, has the Left hit rock bottom yet?

I would note that the tidal wave of mainstream media reports on sexual deviance and misconduct on the part of celebrities and politicians has been composed primarily of people on the left. Celebrity icons that are long time representatives of Democratic party money and support. I find it interesting also that many of these celebrities are people who attacked Donald Trump for his rather minor recorded discussion of sexual activity, the same recording the mainstream media used to admonish him as akin to a rapist.

Whether or not the accused people are guilty, or even require a self-flagellating apology, remains to be seen. I am not one to take the court of public opinion very seriously. That said, I wonder why there have not been more accusations against Republican icons recently? I mean, Republican figures have certainly not been strangers to sexual misconduct in the past, so why are the vast majority of pariahs being exposed today, including Harvey Weinstein, major Democratic players?

My theory is that the establishment and the controlled media are being very selective in their targets and are going after mainly leftists who represent low hanging fruit. But why? As mentioned above, the extreme Left must hit rock bottom, and then mutate into something else. They must be molded into something even more extreme. The social justice cult must be pressured into doubling down.

The people who supported attacks on Trump over his sexual commentary now look like idiots because some of their favorite Hollywood idols are being exposed as allegedly much worse in their behavior. What will their response be, I wonder? Admit they were wrong? Or become even more zealous in their political correctness and indignation?

The obviously fraudulent and completely fabricated Russia-gate issue is also disintegrating. But, contrary to what many conservatives and liberty movement analysts assumed, this piece of propaganda was NOT meant to take down Donald Trump; not in the slightest. In fact, it was meant to help radicalize the Left, to make them more aggressive and violent and to give them false hope that there was a way to get rid of Trump without waiting for another election. That hope is being taken away from them as Russia-gate fumbles.

The people who blindly supported the Russia-gate narrative now look like idiots. What will their response be, I wonder? Will it be to admit they were wrong? Or, will they become even more angry and violent?

The U.S. government is clearly ready to help this narrative along. The FBI and DHS officially classified ANTIFA activities as “domestic terrorist violence” back in September. And, according to Edward Klein who is publishing FBI documentation on leftist groups in his new book, the government is also asserting that leftists have been traveling to Europe to meet with Al-Qaeda and ISIS representatives, apparently to form ties with said organizations and to learn terrorist skill sets.

Do I believe this to be true? No, not really. This kind of agency propaganda reminds me quite a bit of the propaganda used against “patriot groups” over the last decade, including the not so subtle insinuations that “right-wing extremists” would work with Al-Qaeda and form an alliance. Which is, of course, absurd, because right-wingers are pretty adamant about opposing the tyranny inherent in Islam.

The claim may be more believable in the case of cultural Marxists, but still unlikely. What is MORE likely, and what I have been warning about since before Trump’s election, is that there will be terror attacks in the name of leftist ideologies, but that these attacks will for the most part be initiated by the establishment. Just as the establishment funded and trained Al-Qaeda and ISIS and then set them loose to create havoc, and just as the establishment has engineered false flag attacks that were automatically blamed on a designated bogeyman, it now appears to be the extreme Left’s turn.

If we see catalyzing events like war and continued economic downturn, the chances of Leftists being swept into an engineered fervor are even higher.

The Left is plummeting into the depths of embarrassment and despair. As Trump’s first term goes forward, these feelings are probably only going to fester. Civil unrest and rioting are inevitable, but the greater threat is the issue of Gladio-style terror that is obviously being prepared. The narrative is being carefully set. And, at this point, conservatives are all too happy to believe that the Left is capable of almost anything. With the madness they have displayed so far, why wouldn’t we think the worst of them?

Again, the danger is that when this begins to happen in great frequency, conservatives may respond by acting against their own ideals of limited government and individual liberty. When terror attacks are blamed on the Left, how will we react? Will we question the validity of the narrative? Will we apply suspicion to the Trump administration, which has only increased the number of swamp creatures in “the swamp” since its inception? Will we seek out solutions to the problem by staying true to the Constitution and without turning to state power? Or, will we embrace the narrative, embrace the Trump administration without question, throw our full weight behind government power and say “Let’s stomp lefty faces into the dirt!”

I hope this will not be the outcome, because if it is, then the last vestiges of liberty in America are doomed. Hating the Left could be seen as reasonable and rational in our era, but abandoning our principles is not.

4061,4612,The 10 “Grey Swans” Events For 2018,"The 10 “Grey Swans” Events For 2018

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

One of the traditional push backs against attempts to predict “black swan” events is that they are by default unpredictable, rendering the entire exercise moot. However, for the second year in a row, Nomura’s Bilal Hafeez has found a loophole, or rather loop-animal: the grey swan.

As Hafeez writes, while he would like to be able to predict black swans, by definition that is impossible. “However, its close cousin the grey swan can be foreseen. These are the unlikely but impactful events that, in our opinion, lie outside the usual base case and risk scenarios of the analyst community. So as we did last year we have put on our creative hats and have come up with 10 potential grey swan events for 2018.“

For the purpose of this exercise, Nomura avoided the more widely discussed – and more probable scenarios such as the Italian elections, US Impeachment risk, North Korea conflict, which it covered in its event risk radar series, and has instead selected topics that have not been as widely discussed.

“Needless to say, none of them are our base case, but we think it is better to be prepared than not.”

So without further adoNomura’s potential grey swan events for 2018 include:

: “Get to the chopper!” Shock 10: Credit: stealth leverage pops?

Here are the details for each of the swans:

1. What the movies tell us about 2018

Films may end up being better predictors of grey swans than research analysts. Remember it was a film that first predicted a black president of the US (The Man, 1972), the rise of China as an economic powerhouse (Americathon, 1979) and the rise of tabloid TV (Network, 1976). As it happens, we’ve found three notable movies that are based in 2018, and here’s what they foretell.

The 2009 film, Terminator Salvation, is set specifically in 2018. The backdrop is a conflict between Skynet and the human resistance. For the uninitiated Skynet is a computer system developed for the US military by Cyberdyne Systems. The system was intended to safeguard the world by pre-empting attacks. However, it soon developed artificial general intelligence and decided that humans were the biggest threat to the planet. Skynet among other things could control mobile phones, drones and cyborgs/ Terminators (or as Arnie says in Terminator 2: “I’m a cybernetic organism. Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton”).

It would be easy to dismiss this 2018 scenario, but let’s run through the necessary ingredients for it to emerge. We would need the existence of drones, computer-controlled power grids and networked transportation and food systems. Layered on top of this, we would need AI/machine learning capabilities. What would make the system much more fragile would be the replacement of all physical forms of mediums of exchange such as gold by say a cryptocurrency …hmmm, is Skynet reading this?

If this isn’t scary enough then 2018 could prove to be like it was depicted in the 1975 film Rollerball. This is when the world is run by a global energy monopoly, Energy Corporation. Energy Corp wishes to replace warfare with a violent sport called Rollerball, which consists of two teams racing around a circular track on roller skates attacking each other. The plot of the movie hinges around the star player of Rollerball becoming too popular for Energy Corp and they try to get him killed in a match. He, of course, survives and reveals the nature of Energy Corp to the world.

The essence of the movie is that behind any veneer of democracy and competition, there lays a corporate imperative to distract the masses with mindless and often violent entertainment. To be honest, many would subscribe to this view already! But to reach the scales of Rollerball control, we would need one or two global companies emerging to dominate the world – ideally in sectors that can distract us with fake news, fun games and constant distractions. Surely we’re not close to that are we?

Finally, I can’t ignore the 2012 film Iron Sky. Don’t laugh, but the plot revolves around a manned mission to the dark side of moon in 2018, where the descendants of Nazis are discovered. These Moon Nazis take some technology from the astronauts and invade Earth. Film connoisseurs will know that this is an unlikely scenario as the 2011 film Transformers Dark Side of the Movie already told us that the Decepticon transformers are on the dark side of the moon. They would have easily wiped out the Moon Nazis. But hang on, it would also mean that there would now be a fleet of Decepticons ready to invade the Earth in 2018…

2. The “Amazonification” of inflation

2018 is expected to be the year when inflation kicks back. But the recent drag on US inflation has been caused by the sharp decline in goods price inflation and perhaps the “Amazon effect” won’t stop there. If you look at the amount of column inches dedicated to the disruption Amazon has brought upon industry you’d be surprised to learn that it still only operates in 14 countries. For two of them the focus until recently has been on just selling books. But to focus on this one company would do disservice to how far the deflationary force of technological disruption can go on a global basis.

Alibaba’s sales on “singles day” is four times bigger than Amazon’s Cyber Monday or Black Friday. Latin America’s Mercado Libre operates in far more countries and Silicon Valley is yet to replicate the take-up rate of Kenya’s M-pesa or scope of services offered by China’s Wechat. Innovation and disruption take place in many forms and under many different banners, so to quantify their impact we need to think bigger.

There are now more mobile phone subscriptions in the world than people, rising to a level where the world’s poorest households are more likely to have access to a mobile phone than to clean water. But the internet is still in its early growth phase. The number of active mobile broadband subscriptions in the world has only just breached the 50% mark. We are still far away from the world being truly “connected.”

The first wave of global internet connectivity coincided with the rise of globalisation when China joined the WTO. This saw a marked moderation in goods price inflation in the developed economies. Right now there has been an impressive rise in smartphone ownership in the developing world; there is clearly a second wave of internet connectivity taking place. The argument for lower goods price inflation is clear; with smart phones, not only is online shopping more convenient, but while trying out goods in typical bricks and mortar stores you can decide to buy online for less (“Showrooming”). It’s no wonder the rate of online retail sales in the developed world is picking up at a pace (Figure 2).

But there is an argument to say that the technological dampening of inflation may be more persistent than before. The outsourcing of services abroad is easier, the gig economy seems here to stay, AI is on the rise and the disruption from the widespread adoption of 3D printers or indeed cryptocurrencies is yet to be witnessed. Policymakers are split on the matter though, the ECB’s Mario Draghi said there was little evidence that e-commerce was depressing inflation, while the Kansas City Fed’s work (from 2004) on the matter points to clear higher productivity gains and therefore lower inflation. But FOMC members are still using a shotgun-like approach to explaining why inflation has been persistently low with long lists of possible but unquantifiable reasons. Further disruption and disinflationary pressures remain a clear risk into 2018. Our focus would be in Australia, where mobile broadband speeds are the second highest among the G10, inflation remains historically low and … Amazon has just opened its doors for one-day delivery services.

3. 2% inflation targeting goes out of style

“We may need to adjust monetary policy frameworks accordingly” (BIS, 2017).

While inflation targets of around 2% are often viewed by markets to be an immutable force of nature, the truth is they are a relatively new phenomenon. First adopted by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) in 1989, as recently as 1997 there were only five recognised inflation targeters – New Zealand, Canada, the UK, Sweden and Australia. According to the Bank of England, there are currently 29 countries that are fully-fledged inflation targeters (not including the ECB, which avoids describing itself as such).

So while we may take it as a given that inflation targeting is here to stay, a longer view could reveal it to be nothing more than an economic fad. In time, inflation targeting may either be jettisoned or modified. Since the GFC, price-level targeting or nominal GDP targeting have been popular subjects of debate since the GFC hit. In the US in particular, an active discussion has been taking place on these fronts. One reason for the discussions are that given the low natural rate of interest, and hence a low terminal rate, the Fed would have limited ability to use short rates to battle the next downturn. Former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke has advocated a hybrid inflation-target/price level target approach, especially for times when short rates are near the zero bound.

Elsewhere, consideration has been given to lowering the inflation target. There are two key reasons for doing this. The first is the lack of success in hitting an inflation target over recent years. If we look at key inflation targets for the G4, US core PCE inflation has averaged 1.7% since 2000 (and 1.5% since 2010). In the euro area CPI inflation has managed 1.75% (1.3%) and Japanese core CPI -0.1% (1.1%). Only the UK seems to be hitting its target with 2% since 2000 (2.2% since 2010). The whole point of an inflation target is that it builds confidence in where inflation will be in the future. Constant misses, consistent in direction will erode that trust and at some point it become better to admit defeat and shift lower.

The other reason for considering a lower inflation target is demographics. According to the Oxford Institute of Population Ageing, within 20 years many countries in Asia and Europe will see a situation where the largest population cohort is 65+ and the average age approaches 50. For those in their sunset years, is inflation a pure cost eroding the purchasing power of their savings with little benefit for the economically inactive? So while central banks will (for now) likely retain their independence on the means to hit inflation targets, the executive / legislative powers in some countries could see political benefits in lowering this to 1%.

4: A United States of Europe

2018 presents a unique political opportunity for the European Union and in particular those countries within the euro area to forge closer ties and perhaps embark upon a political journey that will end with the creation of a ‘United States of Europe’ – the longstanding dream of many federalists within the continent. The reasons for the propitious backdrop are threefold.

Less focus on domestic politics: There are still some near-term hurdles to be overcome (Germany actually getting a government, an Italian election in H1 2018 and Catalonian elections next week). If these are resolved, we have a decent gap with no major elections in major countries for some time (Germany 2021, France 2022, the Netherlands 2021, Spain 2020 and Italy…?). Not only does this free up bandwidth for key European political actors to think about European matters, but may also end the de facto ban on any European treaty change that has been in place in recent years. Against the backdrop of waning support for populist parties, an axis of Merkel / Macron, supported by pro-European leaders in other countries could look to define their legacies by driving forwards with an agenda of European federalism (it probably will not be called that though).

Brexit in the background: With one of the European Union’s largest countries deciding to go its own way (kind of) it naturally raises the question of what relationship other European countries want to have. If the answer is to have more integration and provide a positive case for a United States of Europe this would be the perfect riposte to Brexit and some of the nationalist, populist politics that have afflicted parts of the continent in recent years as well.

Fixing the roof while the sun is shining: One of the lessons learnt from the global financial crisis and the euro crisis that followed is to fix the roof while the sun is shining and don’t wait for when it rains. European growth is at its strongest in years. The EU unemployment rate has fallen from 11% in 2013 to 7.4% currently and shows no signs of stopping. The low in the previous boom period was 6.8% and at the current run rate that could be achieved in under 12 months. Increasing the pace of integration will bring with it some risks and possibly even some J-curve impacts. This suggests there is no better time to undertake this project than now.

Something like a United States of Europe cannot be built in a year. But steps on a path that the market understands to be leading there can be taken. A grey swan event for 2018 is that European politicians understand the temporal opportunity they have been given, and undertaking such a path starting with a treaty change that leads to increased mutualisation of debts and sharing of risks. It is important to note that comments from key European leaders are heading in this direction. You can see it in the rhetoric of Jean-Claude Juncker’s State of the Union address, Macron’s united defence speech and in Martin Schulz’s latest, looking for a United States of Europe by 2025.

5: Another UK political turnaround

In a speech earlier this year at a regular spring conference, we boldly stated that having spent the 2014 edition of the conference discussing the Scottish referendum, the 2015 edition discussing the general election and the 2016 edition discussing the Brexit referendum, at least in 2017 there were no UK political events to discuss. Just over two weeks after this statement was made, Theresa May announced the 2017 general election.

Once bitten and twice shy and all that. So even if the REAL grey swan for UK politics in 2018 would be if nothing interesting happened, that would not give us much to write about. The tail risk we consider, therefore, is if political instability gets so bad that either / or another general election or a second Brexit referendum occurs in 2018.

While it is ex-post easy to see why Theresa May called the 2017 general election (a 20 point opinion poll lead is catnip to any politician), there is no such case now. Under the Fixed Term Parliament Act there are two ways to call an early election. The first, à la 2017, where the government chooses to dissolve parliament with a two-thirds majority in the Commons can be ruled out, we think. So if it did happen it would be because the government has lost a vote of no confidence (and not being able to win another one within two weeks). Ordinarily, this would be unlikely, but the government’s wafer-thin effective majority makes it a possibility and public attempts have been made before. In particular, we would highlight that all it needs is some Conservative (or DUP) lawmakers to get annoyed with the way Brexit is going that they are prepared to bring down the government and risk (from their perspective) a Jeremy Corbyn-led government. Because of how polarising Brexit has become in the UK, this is a risk that cannot be ruled out.

The other potential political event is a second Brexit referendum. Again parliamentary mathematics is the key here. Around 75% of MPs (including a slim majority of Conservative ones) are pro Remain. So why are they pushing through Brexit legislation? They are enacting the will of the people as set out in the 2016 referendum. Of course, the will of the people can change. Over recent months we have seen a slim majority in the polls saying in hindsight it was wrong for Britain to vote to leave the EU. If this trend continues and that slim majority becomes a commanding one this may embolden Remain MPs on all sides of the house to push for a second referendum, perhaps on the outline of the actual deal the UK agrees with the EU. There is an issue of timing here – as things stand there is not a huge amount of time to fit in a referendum.

This is why it would be a tail risk. The really interesting question is what sort of tail risk because there are two different options here. The question could ask whether to accept any deal or instead remain in the EU. Or it could ask whether to accept any deal or crash out of the EU altogether. The market implications of these two different questions would be very different!

6: Bitcoin starts moving other markets

Are you a coiner? It’s hard not to be at least interested with the sharp rise in cryptocurrencies. The level of speculative mania has reached a point where stock prices have been boosted by companies simply inserting “Blockchain” onto the end of their names (yes that happened). This phenomenon echoes the dot-com era, but that’s all we will say about bubbles today.

The arrival of Bitcoin futures will likely see Bitcoin exchange traded funds expand in 2018. Now that cryptocurrencies are entering the “mainstream” could Bitcoin’s high volatility start to move other markets?

As it stands the market cap of Bitcoin is $280bn and that number rises to $523bn when all other 1358 cryptocurrencies are included (a number that seems to be ever rising too). Half a trillion dollars is no mean feat, but it is far away from the $79trn total world market cap or indeed the peak $2.9trn dot-com valuation in 2000. It may be too early for Bitcoin to have a global impact on other asset markets at this stage. Instead, we need to look where investors are most exposed on a regional basis for where this cross-market correlation could bite. With Japan accounting for nearly half of global trade in Bitcoin compared with just 25% in the US, it could be in Asia where Mrs. Watanabe pulls back.

Beyond the price action there is the issue of longevity of cryptocurrencies to consider. We admit we didn’t ‘coin’ the phrase but “before you climb the ladder make sure it’s leaning against the right building” applies here. In the crypto world or “crypto valley” as it’s coined in Switzerland its well understood that Bitcoin is unlikely to be the future of coins. Proof-of-work (POW) cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are energy intensive and time consuming, while proof-of-stake (POS) coins such as the coming Ethereum-Casper are much less so. There are a host of reasons why we have not yet moved on from Bitcoin, POS is in its early stages with security still a concern and people, in general, are not that good with change. When they get used to something, it is very difficult for them to get out of that comfort zone and for most they have only just got their heads around Bitcoin. But for as long as POW is the most common form of cryptocurrency, this could start to have an economic and environmental cost.

Bitcoin’s current estimated annual electricity consumption is 33.2TWh at an estimated cost of $1.6bn, while only 0.15% of the world’s current electricity consumption the rise in Bitcoin has been nothing but underestimated and is somewhat exponential in an age of exponential technologies. Estimates were made in March 2016 expecting Bitcoin’s energy consumption to match that of Denmark by 2020. Today Bitcoin already has matched that, three years ahead of schedule. So if it’s not risk-off inspired price action from Bitcoin that moves other markets how about higher energy costs? 71% of Bitcoin mining takes place in China powered by cheap coal electricity. So perhaps the grey swan of next year is not Bitcoin’s bubble bursting, as so many commentators tend to suggest, but instead it’s continued rise and a surging demand for coal.

7: Housing market decline = rate cuts?

Solid growth, low interest rates and hot money inflows from overseas have fuelled rapid house price gains in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden (Figure 8). As discussed in Residential speed limits, these growing imbalances cannot be ignored by policymakers. Investors have been calling for a downturn for some time in these markets. 2018 could be the year – indeed we are already seeing declines in Norway and Sweden.

Residential investment has soared, driving increased supply which could outstrip housing demand and see prices move lower. Furthermore, to offset growing housing imbalances, regulators have tightened macroprudential policy through stricter lending standards and measures to deter foreign inflows. With limited historical precedent, there is a risk that policymakers have over-tightened and driven a slowdown.

The consumption share of GDP in these economies is large. Falling house prices (and negative wealth effects) could see the consumer hold back on discretionary spending, particularly with real wage growth still low/subdued. Moreover, debt-to-income levels are at historical highs, meaning households are more sensitive to adverse changes in income, asset prices and interest rates than usual. A recent BIS study argued that in a high debt economy, “interest hikes could be more contractionary than cuts are expansionary”, making it difficult for policy makers to use monetary policy to curb these imbalances from building.

A house price collapse would have significant market implications. Rates markets currently price these economies’ central banks normalising policy significantly over the next two years, with the Fed being the only central bank to outpace them (see Figure 9). If this grey swan materialises, expectations for normalisation would be significantly reduced.

In fact, central banks may cut under this scenario. The RBNZ has already flagged weaker domestic demand as a downward scenario that could lead to rate cuts. The RBA, BoC, Norges Bank and Riksbank have all noted that the housing market is a key risk to their outlook. A significant house price decline could push them towards much more dovish monetary policy stances with further rate cuts still on the table.

If this negative scenario unfolds, a substantial market repricing is likely. The timing for the first interest rate hikes in the Antipodeans and Scandies would be shifted back and even removed. Further hikes from the BoC would be priced out. Under extreme scenarios, rates markets may move to pricing cuts rather than hikes. Respective bond yields would move lower and currencies will depreciate versus the majors.

8: A bigger proxy war in the Middle East

In recent years the conflicts in the Middle East have tended to start with a bang, but then assumed a “low intensity” character. The underlying problem that gave way to the conflict in the first place is not resolved, but the conflict remains relatively contained without degenerating into a flare up of tensions that engulf the whole region. This is what happened in Yemen, Qatar and more recently in Lebanon.

Our baseline is that this pattern will hold in 2018 too and these conflicts will remain “frozen”. However, 2018 may be different and the tensions may intensify in a manner to threaten regional stability. We see two theatres where the risks of imminent escalation are most significant (even though not part of the baseline):

Yemen: Houthi rebels have already shown that they can fire missiles targeting Riyadh, although they failed to inflict significant damage. If such attacks continue and prove more costly for Saudi Arabia, the Kingdom may decide to increase its military involvement in Yemen, increasing the risk of a direct clash with Iran.

Lebanon/Palestine: The immediate risk of a proxy war in Lebanon that emerged after the unexpected resignation of PM Hariri seems to have been defused. However, President Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as capital of Israel may increase this risk again as Lebanon’s Hezbollah and Palestine’s Hamas have called for a renewed “intifada” in response to Trump’s decision. Against Hezbollah involvement in a possible intifada, Israel might decide to take the battle to the Lebanese territory, directly clashing with Iranian proxies/forces, with tacit support for Israel from some of the Sunni countries.

If these risks materialise, CDS spreads and the currencies of the countries involved may come under pressure. However, one other point to consider will be the impact on oil prices and global inflation. If tensions reach the point where markets become concerned about oil supplies, then there might have a notable increase in global energy prices. It is difficult to forecast where oil prices will settle in such a scenario, but we stress-tested our baseline forecasts with the Brent oil price at $80, an increase of around 30% from its current price level.

With all the usual caveats that apply to such simulations, we find that an oil price shock of this magnitude would add 0.4 and 0.9 percentage points to 2018 headline inflation in the US and eurozone, respectively. Our colleagues in Japan see core inflation breaching 1.5% if the Brent oil price stays above $80/bbl, although they think it would be premature for the BOJ to modify its 10yr JGB yield target in response to such a shock.

In EM, we recently looked at the winners and losers of an oil price shock. Outside the countries that are directly affected by regional tensions, Russia, Colombia, Malaysia and Brazil would be among the winners, while China, India, Indonesia, Thailand, South Africa and Turkey would be among the losers of a high oil price.

The bottomline is with output gaps in major economies dwindling, an energy price shock may more easily lead to second-round effects on inflation, which may require a monetary policy response with knock-on effects on risk assets.

9: “Get to the chopper!”

Helicopter money is now disappearing from investors’ minds (Figure 11). However, we may finally observe helicopters dropping money in 2018.

2018 is expected to be a year of further monetary policy normalisation globally. Inflation has been disappointing globally, but markets now expect central banks to stress the economic recovery and financial stability (higher equity prices), not inflation. However, investors may be surprised by how strongly a few central banks can adhere to their inflation mandate. The BOJ is one of the most likely candidates. In the Abe cabinet, conditions for the BOJ have completely changed, and a further dovish shift cannot be ruled out in 2018, as Prime Minister Abe is now deciding on the next BOJ governor and two deputy governors.

Although our central case is that Governor Kuroda will be re-appointed, an appointment of Mr. Honda, ex-economics advisor to PM Abe and currently ambassador to Switzerland, will be a significant shock to the market. The latest survey among FX investors shows that only 5% of them expect Mr. Honda to be the next governor, but the risk is higher to us (10-15%). Mr. Honda may be also appointed as one of the deputy governors to support Governor Kuroda, shifting the direction of monetary and fiscal policies to the more accommodative side.

What can the BOJ do? We think clearer cooperation with government deficit financing is likely. The government and BOJ released a Joint Statement in January 2013, which can be re-written to loosen fiscal discipline further. In his interview with Reuters on 8 November, Mr. Honda said that the joint statement must be rewritten to have a joint goal of JPY600trn of nominal GDP. The BOJ’s policy target will thus be revised to make the policy mix more accommodative. Mr. Honda also said current fiscal policy management is tight, while he also said the BOJ may accelerate its JGB purchases to JPY100trn per year if an economic shock occurs.

The government has already given up its target of achieving a primary balance surplus by FY2020, loosening its fiscal discipline. Further loosening of fiscal discipline is possible, and the appointment of Mr. Honda will be viewed as a clearer sign of further delays of the sales tax hike. If Mr. Honda is appointed, expectations for a much looser fiscal and monetary policy, i.e. helicopter money, may be ignited.

This is not just a story of Japanese politics. A step towards helicopter money is actually recommended by ex-Fed Chair Bernanke. At the conference held by the BOJ in May 2017, he stated that “if more stimulus is needed, the most promising direction would be through fiscal and monetary cooperation, in which the BOJ agrees to temporarily raise its inflation target as needed to offset the effects of new fiscal spending or tax cuts on the debt-to-GDP ratio.” For central banks facing policy limitations, helicopter money can be a natural step towards further easing. We should remember another major central bank, the ECB, also faces limited policy options for resolving negative shocks

10: Credit: stealth leverage pops?

After years of accommodative policy, we think the risk is that leverage has built up in the system and as the Fed drains liquidity via the B/S and higher rates, the potential imbalance that may have been up could be exposed. So does US credit pop in 2018?

Policymakers are always fighting the last war and in many ways, that has been a good thing because from a variety metrics, the US banking system is now more sound. Years of re-stocking the capital base, lower overall leverage (versus other periods) and less reliance on short-term funding no longer put banks in the cross-hairs. Granted if there was a severe enough recession or sharp repricing in financial assets, US banks would be affected. However, the stress tests suggest the majority would come out ok.

Where is the leverage? It lurks in various forms; let’s call it stealth leverage

Commercial Real Estate: During 2008-12, banks with high concentrations of CRE loans were about three times more likely to fail than all banks nationwide, according to Richmond Fed research. As specialized knowledge on local real estate markets is often key to CRE loan markets, community and regional banks are major credit providers. Risks associated with construction and land development loans (CLD), the riskiest component of CRE loans (Figure 12), appear concentrated in small banks, which may not have the stuffiest buffers to absorb potential losses associated with CRE loans. In addition, CRE valuation remains at the highs when compared with residential real estate.

Subprime Auto Loans: One area of consumer credit that has resurfaced on the radar is subprime, but this time in the auto loan sector. The recent peak in 2015 saw nearly 40% of all US auto loans go to subprime borrowers. There has been a slowdown since and new origination versus total auto loans has decelerated (thus a lower flag). However, the total existing debt load of the past few years is about $0.4trn. During the oil fallout, defaults picked up quickly in shale-producing states. If the economy slows, the risk is that auto sector would get hit, but overall a pop here is not likely to be systemic.

Student Loans: Another concern among those worried about the consumer is the high levels of student debt. Instead, it has led to more of a behavioural shift of less home buying. But as wages rise, these debts will not all pop at once. This too is less systemic.

Financial Leverage: This is where the embedded leverage is in the system. Over the past 10 years, the fastest-growing debt was in capital markets, as seen in corporate debt up roughly $3trn, as highlighted in our Fed QT Supply/Demand study (see link). Some of this was smart usage of debt, terming out to lock-in low costs of funding, but much of this went into stock buybacks and/or to highly leveraged corporates. In fact, the credit quality of the universe has moved towards BBB and higher duration (see link). A reprice of corporate credit when balance sheets are still thin could indicate that meaningful risk lies ahead. Deeper under the surface margin debt for stock purchases are also at all-time highs. Finally, some vol selling strategies in ETF form could be the pin prick to passive investing.

After talking with both Stephanie and Laura for a week I thought it would be good if they met. Stephanie wanted her story out as she felt the main stream media was not giving the other side a fair shake at even considering a second, or more, shooters. Also it is important that we find out who was in VIP 6. We did have one person come forward but we have not verified that info yet. Thank you Laura and Jason for doing this. Stephanie greatly appreciates it, as do I. The Las Vegas shooting at Mandalay Bay was the worst in US history. Stephen Paddock killed himself before police breached his room.

We have much to be thankful for in receiving God’s wondrous gift of faith

The Gift of Faith



When we think of faith, how many of us believe that it must rise from our own being? That in order for us to be successful in achieving our dreams, we must have faith in ourselves? The truth is, faith is a gift and not by the measure of the world that touts the mantra that thinking good thoughts by force of will, good things are then manifested. Faith is a gift of the Holy Spirit. 1 Corinthians 12

8 For to one is given through the Spirit the utterance of wisdom, and to another the utterance of knowledge according to the same Spirit,

9 to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit,

10 to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another the ability to distinguish between spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. (ESV)

Yet we have a tendency to fall back on the idea that if only we could build our faith the good stuff will come into our hands. And some pray for faith when they don’t believe in the One who gave us faith. Here’s a plain answer to part of the conundrum why prayers are not answered – if you don’t believe in God who bestows all gifts, including faith, and brings forth miracles, there is no way possible for you to receive any of them. Simply put, you cannot receive a gift from any entity you think doesn’t exist. Faith can only come to one who believes God “is,” that He is true and freely gives us this gift as part of the full package of grace, mercy, forgiveness - wholeness - by His sacrifice on the Cross. So when we ask for stronger, deeper faith, we must realize that we are asking for Jesus’ blessing to be manifested within our spirit, which blossoms only because we recognize with Whom that spirit has been joined. Jabez called on God to “…bless me indeed.” (1Chronicles 4:10) Break down the word and you have “in deed,” otherwise meaning “in action,” “completed” or “manifested.” He asked, as do we who believe in God and His Son Jesus, that His gift be fulfilled in us, that faith be accomplished in us, that we receive and apply it. Once we receive the gift, we are strengthened to withstand any challenge. We can hold fast to His promises and not doubt Him or His Word. The only caveat is that to know His Word we must read it and become familiar with it. Then we will ask according to His will and it will be answered (1 John 5:14-15). The gift of faith will stand you stalwart in the face of double-mindedness, the niggling uncertainty that what we most believe for that is in line with God’s will may not come to pass. Psalm 33:3-7 tells us how to receive the desires He places on our hearts (gives to us):

3 Trust in the Lord, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.

4 Delight thyself also in the Lord: and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.

5 Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass.

6 And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday.

7 Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for him… Can we trust that God has given us faith, that he grows it within us so we are not dissuaded and distracted from His purpose for us? We can if we know who blesses us with faith and shows us how to rely on it. Christmas is here and the gift of salvation, deliverance, healing, prosperity – wholeness came to earth in the form of Man. The Creator took on the skin of His creation in order to know us by living as one of us, yet without ever straying from His faith, never allowing doubt to master the gift of faith. By Jesus’ example we better understand faith and learn how God’s gift will sustain us just as it did Our Savior, enabling Him to undertake the completion of the greatest work ever to be performed for our benefit… becoming the bearer of all sin, sacrificing all on the Cross and rising to everlasting life. We have much to be thankful for in receiving God’s wondrous gift of faith.

Glenn, you have perhaps no bigger fan of your philosophy, nor a more eager consumer of your many books, broadcasts and events, than me. One of the more memorable events in my life was attending your Restoring Honor rally in Washington, D.C., and sharing breakfast with you, several hundred supporters and Gov. Sarah Palin, in support of the Special Operations Warrior Fund. Never will I forget hearing you announce, “Ladies and gentleman, security just notified me that we should all go soon, because the crowd is already filled beyond the reflecting pool.” Thank you for the greatness of your vision and the amazing courage of your convictions.

The emotional turmoil and political strife swirling throughout our beloved country only grows in intensity by the day. The significance of 2012’s monumental election is creating an ever growing wedge between my political reasoning and yours. Our political divergence is something I - and my instincts tell me - millions of your God fearing, patriotic devotees are struggling with as well. Given this assumption, my personal request is simply this: Seek first to understand. Disagree with vigor, but please respect the intelligence, reasoning and conclusions of millions that disagree with you, without caustic sarcasm, demeaning ridicule or elitist derision. The spirit you exemplified on stage during your Restoring Honor rally is not being modeled in the heat of this debate.

The massive and ineffective spending that has given Americans the most incredibly un-payable debt the world has ever seen, is also super offensive, particularly when one considers that most beneficiaries of your largesse, are friends and/or donors to your campaign and/or your party.

The notion that “Obamacare” was not approved by an overwhelming majority of Americans, but was rammed down their throats anyway, is also infinitely more offensive than what you say.

White House, is more offensive than that. The fact that you appear to be an illegal president is infinitely more offensive to millions and millions of Americans; yet, it doesn’t seam to bother you in the least!

Your administration has shown an incredible ability to create scandals, lie, and harm the country in ways never imagined before. Congratulations, you have taken away from Jimmy Carter the title of the worst President ever!

In other words, millions of Americans believe that YOU are offensive to them!

Americans are not as stupid as you thought they were. On the contrary, they are now on to you and don’t believe, by and large, anything you say, if their lives depended on it.

There are those who believe that you were sincere and that you thought that you could change things around with your policies; I’m not one of them. I firmly believe that you know what you’re doing and that you purposely want to “fundamentally change the United States of America.” And so you have.

How many generations it will take to correct the mess you have placed the once richest country in the world is anyone’s guess, but the United States of America has unsuccessfully been the target for destruction by much better men than you’ll ever be. It won’t happen!

Now, if you stopped trying to sink the economy, perhaps history and the nation will have mercy on you to a certain extent; on the other hand, should you continue the sabotage of America until the bitter end, I’d bet you that you’ll end up in front of a Grand Jury.

Needless to say that, in my view, if you had the possibility of coming clean and show the documents that have been asked of you, you’d have done it long ago. The fact that your team has presented two “birth certificates” which appear concocted by electronic means indicates to me that you are unable to clear yourself.

Pity!

Nevertheless, I wish to thank you. The farcical Jurassic media could have helped you get re-elected and, without your invaluable help, you would have had a second term. Unfortunately for you, your narcissism is so unbelievable that you’re digging your own political grave.

Now it is too late but two years ago, if you had stop taking orders from “Spooky Dude…” who knows?

3141,3614,Govt Shutdown Followed False Flag Missile Warnings (Coincidence?) +Video,"B ertrand D aily R eport The War For Our Mind & Soul Continues

By Capt. Dave Bertrand, Ret.

The article / report below is a detailed report reference the Hawaii and Japan “Missile Warning” which many of us have been analyzing over the past week.

The speculation went from a coincidence with two “morons” accidently entering the “wrong warning” into the computer system that terrified millions of people, a 38 minute delay in Hawaii, before cancelling the alert…..media running with that narrative to the possibility a rogue sub had launched an ICBM and was shot-down. There’s not anything else speculated and the story line is leaning towards a rogue sub. But whose sub was it ?

It was reported on Channel 2 News (Honolulu) on that Saturday morning at about the same time as the alert, a group of 13 on a boat witnessed….of what appeared to be a “comet, but all of a sudden blew up” approximately 100 miles north of the Hawaiian chain.

We discussed the possibility of a CIA (rogue) sub to be the most obvious, while speculation also involves a rogue Israeli Dolphin Class sub, or a rogue Chinese sub involved.

The report below is proof that leans more towards a rogue (documented secret CIA operation) than Israeli or Chinese operations to distract President Trump’s “National Emergency Order / Executive Order” to begin rounding-up thousands of “human abuse / money laundering / child traffickers and pedophile rings” around the world. These type of operations just happens to fund the black projects of the CIA and their globalist counterparts worldwide, while the child trafficking and pedophilia is used to compromise presidents and others as blackmail tactics for future agendas.

We are at war like no other in the history of the United States, a covert war of such magnitude….the “bad guys” are willing to kill millions by a “False Flag” attack on American soil in-order to provoke WWIII via a Trump attack on North Korea. A similar tactic comes to mind, an inside job by rogue elements to justify the war on seven Arab nations…it was 9/11 and the globalists keep using the same play book.

The official list of worldwide false flag attacks for a hidden agenda

The GOAL is to destroy the Trump presidency by death or impeachment while brainwashing Americans into an “emergency presidential election” (if THEY can remove V.P. Pence as well) to open the door to a New World Order puppet. Globalist power houses, empires, bank accounts, companies worldwide, and their lives and freedoms are hanging by a thread because of President Trump. Of the five former U.S. Presidents….two will likely drop dead from stress this year and at least two others will be behind bars. The seriousness of that happening will cause a major blow-back beyond our comprehension as a complacent society of brainwashed morons are pushed to the streets by the globalist / Soros controllers with Obama taking the lead….if both and others are not arrested soon.

The “government shutdown” with Schumer taking the lead (IMO) was planned well before any negotiations between Democrats and Republicans began and is one of the distractions to weaken this presidency while creating a vulnerable National Security issue. The goal by DEMS, besides creating a distraction is to force DACA Dreamers to the streets and at the same time, the DEMS hope that Trump will concede to a DACA deal before the budget plan for a Wall. That would give the DEMS a little more clout for taking back seats in Congress in November. I hope that President Trump will just call their bluff and sign a (reasonable and fair) DACA Executive Order and put Schumer and the DEMS at shame.

I can’t emphasize the extreme and dangerous problems the globalist / “Deep State” criminal conspirators are facing.

The next phase soon will be another “False Flag” and could easily shadow the government shutdown, followed by massive arrests under the Executive order, and when the public sees their favorite leaders being “perp walked” to GITMO, all hell will break loose in America. The result will be Martial Law, while at the same time, we could easily (actually) be at war with North Korea and maybe China as well. America is very vulnerable now….

You can cut off the head of a snake and the snake will continue to wrap it’s body around the arm of the hunter. President Trump is the “hunter” and the snake is Satan, working behind the scenes to destroy America while eventually compromising every soul around the world.

The “Good Guys” under President Trump are continuing to put out the fires, but the “Deep State” arsons will continue at all costs to save their own hides. We are on the fringe of some very interesting and dangerous times. And if you think that a “Shadow Government” controlling a “Deep State” while both are joining forces with evil, then you cannot fathom the possibility that extraterrestrial influence on this planet is real. If you don’t believe that….I can assure you, the Globalist elites surely do. The spiritual realm has been at war for millions of years and it has finally reached our shores….

The Secret Navy behind the Ballistic Missile Attack on Hawaii

http://exopolitics.org/the-secret-navy-behind-the-ballistic-missile-attack-on-hawaii/

Written by Dr Michael Salla on January 20, 2018 . Posted in Featured, world politics

As information continues to emerge confirming that there was a ballistic missile attack against Hawaii that was intercepted on January 13, the investigation begins to shift from what happened, to who was responsible. In this article, I analyze various sources describing the attack, and identify the mysterious naval force that was most likely responsible for launching the ballistic missile, which presumably was nuclear armed.

In my January 17 article, I listed three alternative news sites referring to sources that all said that a ballistic missile was launched against Hawaii by a stealth submarine. The alternative news sources were radio host Dr. Dave Janda, Operation Disclosure (RV/Intelligence Alert), and the Public Intelligence Blog. The Operation Disclosure and Public Intelligence blog sites point to an Israeli submarine as responsible, while Dr. Janda said it was a submarine belonging to a rogue Chinese Navy faction.

Further corroboration for the ballistic missile attack explanation comes from former Forbes Magazine writer, Benjamin Fulford, who saysthat according to his insider sources, there was a submarine based attack:

One sign of this extreme tension came last week when “a missile from a cabal submarine was stopped from hitting Hawaii and the submarine was sunk,” Pentagon sources say. Media outlets around the world have reported that Hawaiian residents all received the following warning on their mobile phones: “BALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII, SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER, THIS IS NOT A DRILL,” but later this was reported to be a false alarm. It was not—it was an attempt by “the cabal” to blame the attack on North Korea and use it as a trigger for their long-desired World War III, CIA sources say.

Both Fulford and the Public Intelligence claim that the ballistic missile was intended to simulate a North Korean attack suggesting the responsible submarine was in the vicinity of North Korea, either in the Sea of Japan or off the Japanese coastline.

In determining the type of missile attack against Hawaii, yet another source refers to a Hawaii tourist boat about 100 miles out at sea that saw what appeared to be a meteorite exploding in the air shortly before the Hawaii Emergency alert went out Saturday morning, January 13. The additional source appeared as an update to the original Public Intelligence blogsite article about the Hawaii missile attack:

Word here in Hawaii is that a group of tourists and tour guides were on a boat 100 miles off shore Saturday morning around 8 AM when they witnessed what they thought to be a meteor blowing up over the ocean. It was reported on Hawaiian channel 2 but then removed from their website. Rumor is the launch came from an Israel Dolphin 2 submarine. Some college basketball games had a red alert across the screen from US Pacific Command declaring a missile launch in the Pacific near Hawaii.

This additional Hawaii source is vital in understanding what happened since it reveals that the missile was coming down from the upper atmosphere following a ballistic trajectory similar to a meteor. This helps confirm that a ballistic missile was involved rather than another type of nuclear delivery system such as a cruise missile which fly much closer to ground and have a far more limited range.

Of the sources cited so far, aside from Dr. Janda, all believe a faction of the Israeli Navy was behind the attack using a dolphin class submarine supplied by Germany. The USS Liberty attack during the 1967 Arab Israeli war is often cited as an example of Israel launching a false flag attack against the U.S. to embroil it in wars against Israel’s regional enemies.

In a private email received on January 19, former CIA covert operative and Marine Intelligence Officer, Robert David Steele, says that the attack was a “Zionist submarine doing a USS Liberty on Hawaii”.

In considering the possibility of a rogue Israeli submarine being responsible, it’s important to review the armaments possessed by the class of submarines belonging to the Israeli Navy. In a news story describing Israel’s possession of Dolphin class submarines purchased from Germany, its armaments are described as follows:

The Dolphin boats are equipped with six 533mm standard torpedo tubes and four 650mm jumbo tubes and can carry 16 weapons. The smaller tubes can fire torpedoes and Harpoon anti-ship missiles as well as other conventional weaponry, but its larger tubes are what makes the Dolphin class so special. From them, frogmen, remotely operated vehicles and especially large cruise missiles capable of carrying nuclear payloads can be deployed.

Israel’s Dolphin Class submarines can carry cruise missiles which are well suited for Middle East operations, rather than ballistic missiles which are better suited for long distance targets thousands of miles away. Ballistic missiles require much larger “boomer submarines” to launch them, rather than the smaller Dolphin class submarines possessed by Israel.

The Dolphin 2 submarine is 69 meters (225 feet) in length, which is less than half the size of the Ohio class boomer submarines (170 meters/560 feet long) used by the US Navy to carry Trident ballistic nuclear missiles. Sea Launched Ballistic Missiles need vertical missile tubes as opposed to the more traditional horizontal torpedo tubes used for Sea Launched Cruise Missiles located at the front of the smaller Dolphin class submarine.

Consequently, it’s unlikely that a renegade faction of the Israeli Navy launched the ballistic missile attack since their Dolphin class submarines simply don’t have the capacity.

Furthermore, it’s hard to imagine how a U.S. war against North Korea and/or China would advance Israel’s national security interests, which are far more concerned about threats posed by major regional rivals such as Iran.

Dr. Janda describes a rogue faction of the Chinese Navy being responsible, and that after the missile had been intercepted and destroyed by the US. Missile defense system, the regular Chinese Navy destroyed the submarine.

This explanation is perhaps the scariest to consider since the US national security apparatus would almost certainly hold China responsible for such an attack despite any genuine factional divisions within the Chinese Navy.

The immediate U.S. response would have been, at the very least, a direct retaliatory nuclear attack against China’s main regional ally North Korea, which would have been scapegoated for a Hawaii attack. After destroying North Korea’s military infrastructure, the country would have then been subsequently overrun and occupied by the U.S. Military and its South Korean ally in an analogous way to Afghanistan after the 9/11 attack.

China’s strategic interests would have been severely setback in such a scenario. It’s hard to imagine any Chinese military commander, rogue Navy faction or not, would risk a nuclear retaliatory strike by the U.S. that would set back China’s steady emergence into a global superpower over the next decade or so. Patience is a characteristic that China’s political leaders possess in abundance.

Consequently, I find it unlikely that a rogue faction of the Chinese Navy was behind the ballistic missile attack.

So who then launched the attack against Hawaii?

For an answer we need to consider legendary Hawaii Senator Daniel Inouye who in 1987 described the existence of a shadowy government within the U.S. with its own separate military assets.

There exists a shadowy Government with its own Air Force, its own Navy, its own fundraising mechanism, and the ability to pursue its own ideas of the national interest, free from all checks and balances, and free from the law itself.

Inouye was clearly convinced of a very highly classified U.S. agency that had the independent funding and wherewithal to develop its own Air Force and Navy outside the regular chain of military command.

In contrast to the assets of the regular U.S. Air Force and Navy, this covert fleet of ships and aircraft would be “dark”, in terms of its security classification. It would therefore be appropriate to call it the “Dark Fleet” which is what secret space program insider Corey Goode says it is called by the U.S. military according to his confidential sources [Skype Communication Jan 18). He says that it is separate to another “Dark Fleet” which is a Secret Space Program that operates in Deep Space.

I need to point out that in 2017, I personally met some of Goode’s confidential Earth Alliance sources. They provided many documents to prove they are deeply connected to NATO security operations and the European intelligence community. They have continued to provide Goode intelligence information since they consider him to be a genuine extraterrestrial contactee, and asset of a Secret Space Program Alliance known to exist by NATO officials.

What U.S. Government agency would have the ability to raise its own “Dark Fleet” outside the regular chain of military command and Presidential executive authority? The only U.S. agency capable of doing so is the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). More specifically, we are talking about the CIA’s Directorate of Operations (formally Clandestine Service) which runs all its global covert operations, where a Dark Fleet would have been developed to meet operational requirements.

The 1949 CIA Act comprised additions to those sections of the 1947 National Security Act that dealt with the creation of CIA. The 1949 CIA Act gave a Congressional stamp of approval to the creation of a ‘black budget’ it could spend without recourse to U.S. law as the following section make clear:

… any other Government agency is authorized to transfer to or receive from the Agency such sums without regard to any provisions of law limiting or prohibiting transfers between appropriations [emphasis added]. Sums transferred to the Agency in accordance with this paragraph may be expended for the purposes and under the authority of sections 403a to 403s of this title without regard to limitations of appropriations from which transferred. [50 U.S.C. 403f(a)]

Essentially, this gave the CIA the power to generate large amounts of money through covert means and launder it however it wished through the Pentagon and the U.S. bureaucracy. The funding was used for an unofficial “black budget” that by 2001 was estimated to be as high as $1.7 trillion annually.

In addition to having the financial means, the CIA has long been developing its own covert Air Force. This began in the mid-1950’s when the CIA established Area 51, as the location to develop future fleets of spy planes with the aid of companies such as Lockheed, which today is the world’s largest defense contractor.

In the 1960’s the CIA began training personnel to develop skills necessary to operate its spy planes on U.S. aircraft carriers. CIA documents confirm that the U.S. Navy was training the CIA on how to operate spy planes on their carriers:

The above document went on to discuss how Kelly Johnson, Director of Lockheed’s Skunkworks, helped the CIA launch its U-2 spy plane from the USS Kitty Hawk

Another CIA document shows the Navy’s reluctance to allow the CIA to use its aircraft carriers to carry spy planes in trouble spots like the Mediterranean, thereby creating the operational necessity for the CIA to eventually acquire its own aircraft carrier to carry fleets of spy planes around the world.

These official CIA documents support the conclusion that by the 1970’s the CIA’s Directorate of Operations had its own squadrons of spy planes, and would have acquired its own aircraft carrier out of operational necessity that it could operate anywhere around the world without any kind of government oversight.

As far as the CIA having its own submarines, a Washington Times article from January 3, 1985 shows that two ballistic missile submarines, USS John Marshall and Sam Houston were handed over to a 2000 man Special Operations Force.

It can be guaranteed that the CIA’s Directorate of Operations would have similarly justified the acquisition of ballistic missile capable submarines for its own covert operations around the world.

With the CIA’s role in generating multiple black budgets, it could easily have diverted some of these funds to defense contractors for building ballistic missile capable submarines for exclusive use in clandestine operations. It’s worth noting that Lockheed Martin builds the Trident II ballistic missiles for the Ohio class submarines currently possessed for by U.S. Navy.

As noted earlier, the CIA and Lockheed have developed a long and close relationship since their joint efforts to develop Area 51 for spy planes and other advanced technologies in the 1950’s. Therefore it is very possible that the CIA’s Dark Fleet possesses Trident II ballistic nuclear missiles developed by Lockheed Martin.

Consequently, Inouye’s claims of a shadowy government possessing its own Air Force and Navy is very feasible given what we know about the CIA’s history, and official documents showing its military assets, training and close relationship with defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin.

The CIA had the independent funding to create squadrons of spy planes that could operate from an aircraft carrier with the necessary support craft that altogether constituted a CIA controlled aircraft carrier battle group that included nuclear submarines.

So was the CIA’s Dark Fleet behind the ballistic missile attack on Hawaii? I put this question to Corey Goode and he responded:

Yes, They DO have an Air Craft Carrier and destroyers and support vessels, a whole fleet….This stuff has been a part of recent briefings in the form of informed speculation as to what occurred in Hawaii/Japan. All are pretty convinced that rogue CIA sub fired missiles and MIC SSP [USAF/NRO/DIA Secret Space Program] took the missiles out. We are all waiting for specifics and confirmation but these are “read in” General/Colonel types doing the speculating.[Skype Communication 1/19/18)

The CIA’s Directorate of Operations has long been the primary asset of what Inouye called the Shadow Government, but today is referred to as the “Deep State”. Due to President Trump’s December 21, 2017, Executive Order freezing the financial assets of all involved in human rights abuses and corruption, Trump was not only declaring war against U.S. global elites involved, but also against the funding sources for the CIA’s covert operations.

The CIA’s black budget is made possible by human rights abuses and corruption around the planet that provides almost unlimited funds for its covert operations, including its Dark Fleet. Consequently, the CIA’s Dark Fleet had the means, motive and opportunity to attack Hawaii with a ballistic nuclear missile that would embroil the Trump administration in a major regional war with North Korea and possibly China.

Significantly, on January 16, Japan’s major public broadcaster also warned the public about an incoming ballistic missile attack. Once again, a false alarm was issued shortly after by government authorities.

It’s quite possible that the same submarine responsible for the Hawaii attack, launched another missile attack, this time against Japan, presumably Tokyo. It was also brought down, probably by the same defense forces that tracked and destroyed the Hawaii bound missile. Again, the purpose would have been to simulate a North Korean attack thereby triggering a major regional war.

Such a war would distract the Trump administration and U.S. military from going after Deep State assets, and tie down the U.S. in a serious regional confrontation. Thankfully, the U.S. Navy and Air Force, along with the USAF run secret space program, were able to neutralize the attacks on Hawaii and Japan.

The multiple sources and documents cited above lead to a remarkable conclusion. A CIA created secret Navy launched ballistic missile attacks against Hawaii and Japan using a Dark Fleet created in the 1970’s to support covert operations around the world.

Consequently, neutralizing the “Dark Fleet” and reigning in the CIA’s Directorate of Operations must become a high priority goal for the Trump Administration and the Pentagon. A major step in doing so is for the truth to be officially released about ballistic missile attacks against Hawaii and Japan.

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

While we published both the full text(1,097 pages) and the “explanatory” statement (only 570 pages) released by the House-Senate conference committee on the final Republican Tax Bill, also known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), we are confident not many readers – or anyone else for that matter – will read the full text.

So, as we previewded yesterday, here again is the Cliff Notes version of what the GOP agreed on late on Friday, and which will be voted early to mid-next week by both the House and the Senate:

CORPORATE TAX RATE : Cuts corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent , beginning Jan. 1, 2018.

: Cuts corporate , beginning Jan. 1, 2018. PASS-THROUGHS: Creates a 20 percent deduction for the first $315,000 of qualified business income for joint filers of pass-through businesses such as partnerships and sole proprietorships. For income above that threshold, the legislation phases in limits that produce an effective marginal tax rate of no more than 29.6 percent.

REPATRIATION: Sets a one-time mandatory tax of 8 percent for illiquid assets and 15.5 percent for cash and cash equivalents on $2.6 trillion in U.S. business profits currently held overseas. That foreign cash pile was created by a rule that allowed foreign profits to be tax-deferred if they were not brought into the United States, or repatriated, a tax rule that would be rendered obsolete by the territorial system.

Leaves in place tax credits for producing electricity from wind, biomass, geothermal, solar, municipal waste and hydropower. CARRIED INTEREST: Largely leaves in place the “carried interest” loophole that benefits private equity fund managers and some hedge fund managers, despite pledges by Republicans including Trump to close it. These financiers can now claim a lower capital gains rate on much of their income from investments held more than a year. The new legislation would extend that holding period to three years, putting the loophole out of reach for some fund managers, but preserving its availability for many.

Naturally, without context the above bullets mean little, so here is a quick walkrhough from Goldman’s chief political economist, Alec Philips, who writes that in the latest good news for the economy, the tax cuts in the final bill are larger in 2018 and 2019 than the Senate-passed version, though most of this is due to pulling forward the effective date for the 21% corporate tax rate to 2018 rather than 2019. Offsetting this, however, is that a preliminary read of the bill leads Goldman to believe that the effect on growth from the tax bill will not be substantially different than the minimal 0.3% boost in 2018 and 2019 the bank previously estimated.

In other words, for all the talk – and Treasury promises – of a sharp economic rebound, and the tax plan paying for itself, Goldman is quite skeptical; so much so in fact that it barely see a material increase in GDP forecasts relative to baseline; to wit: “compared to policy as it stands today, the tax cut would equal 0.75% of GDP in 2018 and 1% of GDP in 2019. This is 0.6% of GDP greater in 2018 and 0.2% greater in 2019 than our assumption based on the Senate-passed bill. However, since most of the difference relates to the corporate tax cut taking effect in 2018 rather than 2019 as under the Senate bill, our preliminary take is that the growth effect should not be substantially different than the roughly 0.3% of GDP boost in 2018 and 2019 we previously estimated.”

Below are the main points from Goldman:

The tax cuts would be somewhat more front-loaded than Senate-passed plan and our own estimates. The revenue estimates of the conference agreement released by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) suggest that, on a calendar year basis, the tax cut will be equal to 1% of GDP in 2018 and 1.3% of GDP in 2019 compared to a “current law” baseline that assumes several tax incentives expire on schedule (left panel of Exhibit 1). However, compared to policy as it stands today, the tax cut would equal 0.75% of GDP in 2018 and 1% of GDP in 2019. This is 0.6% of GDP greater in 2018 and 0.2% greater in 2019 than our assumption based on the Senate-passed bill. However, since most of the difference relates to the corporate tax cut taking effect in 2018 rather than 2019 as under the Senate bill, our preliminary take is that the growth effect should not be substantially different than the roughly 0.3% of GDP boost in 2018 and 2019 we previously estimated.

The corporate tax rate would be reduced to 21% starting in 2018. This increases the aggregate size of the tax in 2018 but does not create an incentive for businesses to pull forward capex and other deductible expenses as had appeared likely if the tax cut had taken effect with a delay starting in 2019 . The corporate alternative minimum tax would be repealed, as expected. The limitation on business interest deductibility represents a compromise between the House and Senate. For the next four years, through 2021, businesses (corporations as well as passthroughs) may deduct interest up to 30% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Starting in 2022, this limit would become more restrictive, at 30% of earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). The restriction on net operating losses (NOLs) became incrementally more restrictive than prior versions. Under the final agreement, NOLs could not be carried back, as expected, and while they could still be carried forward, they could be used to offset only 80% of a company’s income , rather than the 90% previously proposed. The international corporate provisions largely resemble the Senate’s provisions, as had appeared likely. The final bill includes a modified version of the Senate’s Base Erosion and Anti-Avoidance Tax (BEAT) as well as a modified version of the tax on global intangible low-tax income (GILTI). The minimum tax rate on such income would be set at an effective minimum tax of 13.125%. The agreement also imposes a slightly higher tax rate on accumulated untaxed foreign earnings (“deemed repatriation”) than the House or Senate bills; the final version would tax earnings held in liquid investments at 15.5%, other untaxed foreign earnings at 8%. Future foreign earnings (whether repatriated or not) would not be taxed by the US unless they are subject to the GILTI tax. On the individual side, the top marginal rate declines to 37%, as opposed to 38.5% under the Senate bill and 39.6% in the House bill. Additionally, it allows state and local tax deductibility – including property as well as income – up to $10k. The final agreement allows mortgage interest deductibility with mortgage principal capped at $750k (existing loans will be grandfathered), but it disallows home equity debt-related interest. The individual AMT remains in the conference agreement, but with increased exemption amounts and phaseout thresholds. Pass-through provisions are similar to the Senate version, but the deduction rate is lowered to 20% (from 23%) of eligible income. Taxpayers with income over a threshold of $315k (down from $500k) face additional restrictions. This further deters high-income taxpayers from using the deduction for wage income. Qualified REIT dividends, cooperative dividends, and publicly traded partnership income is eligible for the 20% deduction. We expect the House to vote on the plan Tuesday, Dec. 19, and the Senate to vote on Wednesday, Dec. 20. With public announcements from Sens. Corker (R-TN) and Rubio (R-FL) that they plan to vote for the bill, the probability of passage looks very high. That said, Sens. McCain (R-AZ) and Cochran (R-MS) have missed votes recently due to health issues and there has not yet been any formal announcements from Sens. Collins (R-ME), Flake (R-AZ), or McCain (R-AZ) on how they plan to vote. While there is still some uncertainty, all of these senators look more likely than not to support the final bill. The bill needs 50 senators to vote for the bill, assuming Vice President Pence breaks the tie, meaning that the bill can pass as long as no more than 2 of the 52 Senate Republicans votes against the bill or is absent. Prediction markets now put the odds of enactment before year end at around 90%.

Finally, a tangent from the WSJ, on the repatriated cash provision. Citing analyst calculations, the newspaper writes that while Republican lawmakers say their tax overhaul would spur companies to hire more employees and build factories in the U.S, one key provision, which could free up hundreds of billions of dollars for companies to spend, probably would benefit shareholders.

The provision changes the tax rules on the profits that U.S.-based companies make overseas. Under current law, companies must pay a 35% tax on the earnings if they bring them to the U.S., though they can get credit for overseas taxes. To avoid the bill, companies have left $1.9 trillion abroad, according to Moody’s Investors Service. The GOP plan would eliminate the tax on ex-U.S. profits going forward, while requiring companies pay a levy on earnings currently offshore at a much-reduced rate.

Based on analyses of past programs to repatriate overseas corporate earnings, Wall Street analysts and tax experts expect companies would use the money for purposes such as buying back shares and mergers. Instead of adding jobs, they say, companies might cut them if they use their cash to buy rivals and then take out costs.

“There will be increased share repurchases, but limited impact on building new plants, real investment activity and employment,” said Dhammika Dharmapala, a University of Chicago law professor who has studied what U.S. companies have done with repatriated cash.

What this means is that when Trump said this morning that:

TRUMP SAYS $4 TRLN TO BE REPATRIATED IN `GREATEST XMAS GIFT’

… he meant for shareholders.

“Shareholders will get the cash” from repatriation, said Kimberly Clausing, a Reed College economics professor and an expert in international tax policy. Executives at U.S.-based companies have complained for years that the country’s tax code makes it hard for them to compete with foreign rivals whose overseas earnings aren’t taxed by their home countries and who in some instances pay lower tax rates on their domestic profits.

And now that the tax will be drastically smaller, instead of issuing domestic debt to fund buybacks, management teams will simply repatriate offshore cash in order to boost their stock price, augment their equity-linked comp and generally make the rich even richer. Some more details:

“We expect technology issuers will use repatriated off shore cash largely for shareholder returns,” Fitch Ratings said in a recent research note. Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said he expects the drug companies he follows to use repatriated cash for share buybacks and acquisitions. “I think we’re going to see the consolidation in the industry we’ve been waiting for,” Dr. Divan said. Analysts predict Pfizer Inc., would use repatriated money to do a big deal. The company has about $22 billion in cash overseas, and Chief Financial Officer Frank D’Amelio has said its priorities for using any money brought to the U.S. following tax changes “are dividends, share buybacks, investing in the business and M&A.”

As for the rest of the economy, Goldman said it best: “we do not believe the effect on growth from the tax bill will be substantial. “

9989,11266,Obama’s Proposed Capital Gains Rate Hikes Will Hurt the Economy,"President Obama just told the country during his State of the Union address that he is going to increase the capital gains rate again in order to raise revenue for new spending programs. Given that Obama already knows that raising the capital gains rate actually REDUCES revenue, we are left with a President who believes that we can pay for increased spending by reducing revenue.

He acknowledged this in 2008 during a televised debate against Hillary Clinton, but went on to state that rates should be hiked – despite its effect of reducing revenue – because it was more “fair” taxation (ludicrous, but a subject for another day).

Extraordinarily and equally disappointing about this fundamental economic error is that no one in the major press outlets, on the day after the State of the Union speech, pointed out the President’s gaffe. Do we really have a President who pushes for paying for increased spending projects with policies that reduce revenue? Or do we have a President who puts forth an initiative that he knows has very little chance of realization, but chooses to do so anyway so he can characterize the Republicans as protecting the wealthy while he can claim to protect the middle class? And did he believe that the media was so clueless that they would not laugh at him the following day?

Capital gains are unusual in that the taxpayer has the ultimate decision as to whether and when to sell his asset (stock, his business, a work of art, etc.) The higher the tax rate, the LESS likely he is to sell, seeing as he will only be able to enjoy or reinvest what is left of the proceeds AFTER TAX. History has borne this out – capital gains tax collections go down in the periods after increases, and go up in the years after decreases.",http://canadafreepress.com/print_friendly/obamas-proposed-capital-gains-rate-hikes-will-hurt-the-economy,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

A member of a radical feminist group attempted to steal a statue of the baby Jesus from the Vatican’s nativity scene on Christmas day but was intercepted by police as she grabbed it.

A Reuters photographer happened to witness the incident as the topless woman, shouting “God is woman,” climbed over a guard rail and scrambled up to the scene in a brazen attempt to take the statue of Jesus from its crib.

The photographer, Alessandro Bianchi, snapped a picture showing a Vatican gendarme closing in on the woman, who also had the slogan scrawled across her bare back.

On its website, the Ukranian-French radical feminist group FEMEN identified the would-be thief as Alisa Vinogradova and described her as a “sextremist.”

The group says its goal is “complete victory over patriarchy.”

In a statement released Monday, FEMEN said Vinogradova’s stunt was a protest against the Vatican’s stance on abortion and contraception.

“The FEMEN act was directed against the Vatican’s infringement of the rights of women to their own bodies,” the group stated. “In particular, against the policy of the ‘Holy See’ associated with the promotion of the ban on abortion and ‘sacred condemnation’ of contraception.”

The incident occurred about two hours before Pope Francis delivered his Christmas message to 50,000 people gathered in St. Peter’s Square, reports Reuters.

FEMEN staged a similar protest in 2014, when a member successfully snatched the statue of Jesus from its crib.

Meanwhile, the genesis of the vulgar “pussyhats” has been battened down to “pink cat’s ears”, and no one looks more comfortable in a pink cat’s ear hat than Women’s march prop-providing Senator Chuckie Schumer

Senator Chuck Schumer Providing Backdrop for Women’s March 2018



The Biggest Star of Women’s March 2018 is (drum roll, please): Senator Chuck Schumer, a male-#MeToo-er of which there now seem to be so many. It was Schumer who managed to pull off the timely shutdown of the government—one day before the march—providing the march its main backdrop: “Against the backdrop of the U.S. government shutdown that took hold Saturday, many marchers pointed to the irony of the closure of iconic sites associated with the fight for liberty and equality, such as the Statue of Liberty and the visitor center at the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site in Atlanta. (LA Times, Jan.20, 2018)

“Like last year’s protests, these overspilled U.S. borders, with dozens of overseas gatherings. At a linked event Saturday in Rome, Italian actress-director Asia Argento, one of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein’s accusers, called on women to “speak out and change things.” Nothing’s dramatically changed since their first march:



The Democrats are still willing to shut the government down (in this case for a weekend) in order to hold the country hostage. The loudest screams of outrage in this year’s Women’s March are coming from the #MeToo Movement, 30 some years in the making; ‘Power to the Polls’, the overriding chant even though the masses remember all too well how it was the presidential election campaign polls that overwhelmingly incorrectly predicted Hillary Clinton was the inevitable winner when Donald Trump (screech and scream!) ended up as America’s duly elected president instead. Even the symbolic pink pussy cap of Women’s March 2017 has been flattened down to “caps with cat’s ears.” The L.A. Times calls it “the genesis of the pussyhats or pink cat’s ears hats”. Worst of all for the millions frustrated by Women’s marches, the same old, same OLD celebrities dominate the soap box. No wonder they needed Schumer this time out!

This is the scene of Women’s March 2018 hidden well behind the media hype: “In a boisterous coast-to-coast outpouring, hundreds of thousands of marchers in dozens of cities staged a reprise of last year’s massive Women’s March, seeking to not only deliver a powerful rebuke to the policies of President Trump, but also mount a crucial mobilization for this year’s midterm election.(LA Times) “Hundreds of thousands of marchers in dozens of cities”; “staged a reprise of last year’s Women’s March”? Their numbers are dwindling one year later. “Because of you, the revolution is rolling!” actress Natalie Portman told marchers in downtown Los Angeles, drawing — like many speakers in the #MeToo movement — on the drive to hold powerful men accountable for sexual misconduct, a galvanizing force at many of the rallies. (LA Times) How can the revolution be “rolling” when self-appointed, Artful Dodger-like ‘Leader of the Resistance’ former President Barack Obama is spending the lion’s share of his time building a $1-billion-plus vanity library he dares to call his Chicago Presidential Centre? “Everything is at stake,” actress Jane Fonda told marchers in snowy Park City, Utah, scene of the Sundance Film Festival, in another nod to the #MeToo movement. “We’ve got to give it all we’ve got. Time is up!” (LA Times)

Continued below... Someone should tell Hanoi Jane that “confronting” accused sexual molesters some 30 years after is hardly “giving it all that you got.” “In addition to the roll call of major American cities where marches took place — including New York, Washington, Los Angeles, Dallas, Philadelphia, Chicago, San Francisco, Atlanta — protesters also raised their voices in suburbs and small towns, reflecting the aim of coalescing a broad-based movement on the anniversary of Trump’s inauguration to oppose the president’s stance on immigration, healthcare, racial divides and an array of other issues. (LA Times) Talking about “the irony of the closure of iconic sites such as the Statue of Liberty, the visitor center at the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site in Atlanta is the exploitation of the sites to make a political point. No one at the marches intended to take their children to the iconic sites, they took them out on the Women’s March instead. “There was a short confrontation between supporters of President Trump and some marchers near the end of the march route near Los Angeles Police Department headquarters, where a group of eight Trump supporters stood waving flags and speaking through bullhorns. (LA Times) “Women’s March volunteers stood in a line holding hands in front of the pro-Trump crowd, separating them from the bulk of the marchers. Dozens of police officers kept watch.”

To some MSM, eight people can be described as “a crowd”. “Despite the gravity of the issues at hand, the mood at many of the rallies was lighthearted. Marchers vied to outdo one another with droll signs — “Ugh where do I start,” read one, while another declared: “If you take away my birth control, I’ll just make more feminists.” The age spectrum ranged from babies in strollers to elders helping one another along, with large numbers of men marching along with women.” (LA Times) The “large numbers of men marching along with women” are men who self-identify as “feminists” and should be MSM-pointed out as such. “Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), who was the target of a recent Twitter attack by the president in which he appeared to insinuate that she was willing to trade sexual favors in exchange for financial support, addressed the crowd in the capital, telling them: “It is women who are holding our democracy together in these dangerous times.” (LA Times) Starting in their own homes, women have always been “holding democracy together in these dangerous times” long before #MeToo opportunists came along to swipe their age-old status. In Portland, Ore they’re still out there shouting themselves hoarse with the tiresome old chant: “Hey, hey, ho, ho, Donald Trump’s got to go!” But shamefully raised at Women’s March 2018 is the #MeToo accusation—which the president denies—that he paid off porn actress Stephanie Clifford, known professionally as Stormy Daniels, late in the 2016 campaign to remain silent about an affair they had around the time that Melania Trump gave birth to their son, Barron. (LA Times) “Stormy Daniels, Secretary of Internal Affairs,” read one sign in Los Angeles.” Meanwhile, the genesis of the vulgar “pussyhats” has been battened down to “pink cat’s ears”, and no one looks more comfortable in a pink cat’s ear hat than Women’s march prop-providing Senator Chuckie Schumer.

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

By John Rubino / Dollar Collapse

For at least the past decade the behavior of the people who trade gold futures contracts – and thereby determine the metal’s price – has been generally predictable: The “commercials” – big banks and companies that buy gold to do things with it – have suckered the speculators – mostly hedge funds who chase trends – into going very long and very short at exactly the wrong time.

Which means the price action in gold six or so months in the future was broadly predictable. When the speculators were way long, it was going down and vice versa.

But this year the action – as portrayed in the commitment of traders report (COT) – has departed from the script. After taking on near-record long positions early in the year, the speculators have barely scaled them back from levels that are extremely bearish for gold. Meanwhile gold, instead of tanking as recent history says it should, has been treading water.

And now both the speculators and the commercials have started ramping up their current bets, with speculators going from very long to even more long and commercials going from very short to even more short.

Here’s the same data in graphical form. Where historically the silver bars on top (speculator longs) and the red bars below (commercial shorts) would be expected to converge at the middle of the chart, they’ve diverged and stayed far apart. So the speculators have not been washed out and instead are becoming even more bullish.

If history still matters (a big if in today’s world) the COT trends point to a bad six or so months for precious metals. Though – and this might be the rationale for many speculators – the global financial system has become so fragile that betting on a crisis that sends capital pouring into safe havens is now a permanently good idea.

In that case the solution for individuals is easy: Just buy silver and let nature take its course.

3322,3828,Guv’nuh,"Just as we stepped into a field of rice stubble in which we had built a blind, I looked down and spotted a shivering puppy, crying pitifully. He resembled a Doberman pinscher — solid black with rust-colored jaw patches and feet, and a long nose. When I squatted before him, his dull, mucous-clouded eyes, filled with fear and hopelessness, looked straight into mine.

Wintertime winds are brutal in the Mississippi Delta. They are soaking with humidity, and howl unchecked across ironing-board flat fields. Delta folks call these winds “cuttin’ body hawks.” At daybreak one freezing January morning, the body hawk unleashed its full fury upon us two duck hunters: my lifelong best friend and mentor, the beloved old black man everyone called Jaybird, and me.

That was all it took. Abandoning this starving, helpless little creature was out of the question. Gently, I picked him up, wrapped him in a warm blanket, and put him in the truck.



Later that day, I took the puppy to Old Doc Tom, the local veterinarian. After examining him, the doctor said, “He’s feverish, dehydrated, malnourished, sounds like he’s got severe respiratory problems, and is obviously more dead than alive. You might consider letting me put him to sleep.”

“Let’s give him a fightin’ chance, Doc,” I answered.

“Okay. We’ll do all we can for him, but I wouldn’t get my hopes up if I were you.”



A few days later, Doc Tom called. “Believe it or not, this puppy is still alive, and with proper care, might survive. He is definitely a Doberman.”

I named him Governor, or as we Southerners pronounce it, “Guv’nuh.”



The puppy grew at a rapid pace, as did the bond between us. When I took him to have his tail and ears cropped, Doc Tom said, “Surely that isn’t the same emaciated runt that I had all but given up on! And judging by the size of his paws, he’s going to be huge.”



Huge indeed. In two years’ time he stood about two feet tall and weighed nearly a hundred pounds. As he grew, his faithfulness and obedience to me grew proportionately.

That beautiful animal and I were constant companions. Riding in my pickup, he’d hang out of the window on warm days, snapping at the wind; on cold days, he’d snuggle up against me and drift off to sleep.



Guv’nuh and I enjoyed many happy years together. Reflecting on our love for each other, I can’t help but think … if people were just half as obedient to the Creator of dogs and men as that Doberman was to me, if they served the one true God of the universe with the same unfaltering attitude of faith and love as that dog had for me, what a far better world this would be.

When he died, I removed the collar he had worn all his life and attached it to my pickup’s rearview mirror. It reminds me of the best dog who ever owned a man: Guv’nuh.",http://canadafreepress.com/article/guvnuh,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
9171,10367,Bitcoin Crashes 20% Amid Growing Fears Of Crypto Crackdown,"Bitcoin Crashes 20% Amid Growing Fears Of Crypto Crackdown

% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

As first discussed last night, the selling in bitcoin and across cryptocurrencies – which began as Asia opened, and appeared to be catalyzed by headlines from South Korea’s finance ministry that a cryptocurrency exchange shutdown is still an option…

… accelerated overnight with bitcoin plunging as much as 20% as the prospect of regulatory crackdowns appeared to spread across Asia. Having traded just above $11,000 this morning, the lowest level since late December, and down more than 40% from its all-time high of $20,000 set just a month ago, bitcoin fell 12.3% to $12,130 as at 7:30am ET.

As bitcoin halted a two-day rally, rival cryptocurrencies also plunged, and the losses in bitcoin are largely in line with those seen across the cryptocurrency space. As of writing, Ripple (XRP), stellar lumens (STR) and cardano (ADA) are down at least 25 percent on the day each. Ethereum’s ether (ETH) token has shed 18 percent in value in the last 24 hours.

As discussed last night, traders continue to focus largely on South Korea, one of the busiest markets around the globe for cryptocurrencies, where finance minister Kim Dong-yeon said overnight that shutting down cryptocurrency exchanges is still an option, but in what appeared a backtracking from last week’s vow to crack down on bitcoin by the Justice Ministry, Kim said that measures first need “serious” discussion among ministries, holding out hope for traders that a crackdown won’t go that far. Kim said there’s irrational speculation and that rational regulation was needed.

“The finance minister made it clear they’re definitely considering banning crypto trading – and it’s probably the third-largest market,” said Neil Wilson, senior market analyst in London for online trading platform ETX Capital. “The news is hitting prices and broader sentiment, and it follows China’s move to shutter mines.”

Meanwhile, according to Bloomberg, China – which first began targeting the industry last year – is escalating its clampdown on cryptocurrency trading, particularly online platforms and mobile apps that offer exchange-like services, although with China no longer a notable player in the crypto space, it is unclear what if any impact further halts of China’s already halted exchanges will have, besides just making cryptos that much more attractive of course.

As Reuters adds, a report today says that a PBoC official has said that centralized trading of virtual currencies should be banned, as well as individuals and businesses that provide related services. This is according to an internal memo that refers to PBoC Vice Governor Pan Gongsheng who reportedly said the government would continue to apply pressure to the virtual currency trade and prevent the build up of risks in that market.

“We’ve heard reports that South Korea, China and Japan have considered a shared approach, a path, to regulation,” ETX’s Wilson said, also citing a challenge to digital coins from a bill in the U.S Senate. “It looks like the light touch that has allowed the crypto-boom to explode may be coming to an end,” he wrote in a note to investors.

Also on Monday night, Steven Maijoor, chairman of the European Securities and Markets Authority, said investors “should be prepared to lose all their money” in bitcoin, in a Bloomberg TV interview in Hong Kong. “It has an extremely volatile value, which undermines its use as a currency,” he said. “It’s also not broadly accepted.”

What he really meant is that unlike stocks, traders should not expect a central bank bailout on their crypto investment when things turn rough. Which, of course, is the biggest part of the attraction.

So to summarize the speculated catalysts behind the selloff from CoinDesk:

Firstly, comments on social media indicate there is unease in the investor community over talk of a cryptocurrency trading ban in South Korea and further possible crackdowns on trading and mining in China.

And secondly, BTC futures contracts are trading at a discount to bitcoin’s global average calculated by CoinMarketCap. The January expiry futures contract on the CBOE is trading at $11,510 and CME’s is changing hands at $11,530. Meanwhile, BTC spot is trading at $11,816. The discount (futures price lower than spot price) indicates that the market participants are bearish on the underlying asset (BTC).

For the technicians, the chart analysis indicates scope for a drop to below $10,000 levels if the bulls can’t muster a response today.

The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows:

The rising trendline (blue line) has been breached.

A downside break of the triangle pattern, indicating the sell-off from the record high of $19,891.99 9 (Dec. 17 high) has resumed.

The relative strength index (RSI) has turned bearish (below 50.00), indicating scope for further losses.

The 50-day moving average (MA) has shed bullish bias (flattened).

The 5-day and 10-day MAs carry a strong bearish bias (downward sloping).

* * *

Finally, the selling wasn’t confined to tokens: U.S. stocks with exposure to cryptocurrencies also plunged in pre-market trading:

Riot Blockchain, a diagnostic machinery maker that rebranded as a blockchain company in October, falls 8.1% pre- market

Overstock.com, which has a blockchain subsidiary called Medici Ventures, falls 7.5%

Kodak, which said this month it’s working with WENN Digital to offer a blockchain-based service for paying photographers, drops 8.7%

Metropolitan Bank, the issuing bank for a bitcoin debit card called Shift Card, is down 4.5%. On Jan. 14, Fortune reported that the bank halted all cryptocurrency-related international wires, citing an unidentified Metropolitan customer

Seven Stars Cloud Group, which operated as an on-demand video service in China before buying a 51% stake in a blockchain company in June, drops 3.4%

Square, which has a bitcoin service on its Square Cash app, falls 2.6%

Other cryptocurrency-exposed stocks to watch, according to Bloomberg, include: OTIV, SRAX, XNET, CRCW, RCGR, AMD, NVDA, MARA, MGTI.

As we reported last week, Sweden may or may not be preparing for civil conflict – as Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said that the government would do whatever it takes – including deploying the military – to end the wave of gang violence coming primarily from young migrants in the country’s “no-go” zones.

“It’s not my first action to put in a military, but I’m prepared to do what it takes to ensure that the seriously organized crime goes away,” Lofven said after the party leadership discussion in parliament, adding “it is also obvious that there are social problems… …We see criminals with total lack of respect for human life, it’s a terrible development I’m determined to turn around.”

Lofven’s comments come on the heels of a spate of gang related murders, including that of a 21-year-old man in Malmö last weekend, shot in the head as he stepped out of a taxi near a grocery store.

The same weekend, a 16 year old boy found shot in Rosengård district of Malmö died in the hospital next to a bus stop. Two people were taken in for questioning by the police.

And on January 3rd a 22-year-old man was shot in the Fosie district of Malmö, the day after an 18-year-old woman was taken to the hospital with gunshot wounds ten minutes away in Rosengård.

In Malmö, where a fifth of the 340,000 inhabitants are under 18, children as young as 14 roam the streets with Kalashnikov assault rifles and bulletproof vests. The average age of gang members is 22, the vast majority of them hailing from migrant families. –thetimes.co.uk

The increase in crime has been so overwhelming that Swedish authorities admit they are unable to investigate rape cases right now because of the enormous backlog of gang crime under investigation. “We are forced to choose between two evils,” said police.

Prime Minister Lofven’s strong language also follows an attack on the Rosengård police station last Wednesday after an explosive device was lobbed at the electric-fenced building – the latest in ongoing violence against Swedish peacekeepers.



Rosengard police station was attacked (thetimes.co.uk)

Last August, Stockholm police officer Ted Eriksson, 34, was stabbed in the neck by an Afghan asylum seeker who claimed to be 17 but was suspected of being in his late twenties. The man said he wanted to kill a policeman, however officer Eriksson fortunately suffered minor injuries.

In April, 2017, three Swedish female police officers were beaten as they attempted to apprehend a violent refugee.

In 2013, Swedish police were targeted several times during the Stockholm riots – which saw a police station burned down, several officers injured, and rocks thrown at firefighters and other first responders.

And in 2016, migrants even attacked the crew of ’60 Minutes’ while they were filming a segment on… migrants.

Meanwhile, increasingly powerful weapons have been turning up in Swedish neighborhoods. In 2015, anti-tank missiles were found in a basement of a 36-year-old man suspected of smuggling guns from his brothers in Bosnia into the Swedish no-go zone of Örebro – considered an “Especially vulnerable area” according to a 2017 police report.

The man and five others – described by Bosnian media as linked to the Muslim Brotherhood, were arrested in a series of seven raids. Bosnian Authorities, however, told SVT News that the smugglers are not members of any extremist organizations and have no known links to terrorist activities.

After an investigation following seven raids in mid-2016, Swedish authorities dropped the smuggling charges and prosecuted the Örebro man for possession. He is currently in prison for drug offenses during his ongoing arms-related prosecution.

Police also found a trove of firearms, 16 hand grenades, the four anti-tank missiles pictured above and various other armaments.

Speaking of explosive devices, grenade attacks in Sweden have been on the rise since 2012, although 2017 was a considerably better year, at 10 attacks vs. 34 in 2016.

That year, an 8 year old boy sleeping in the Gothenburg, Sweden living room of relatives was killed by a grenade thrown into the room. “At least five children and several adults were in the flat when the grenade was hurled inside,” according to the BBC, who added that the boy died in his mother’s arms.

And in February, 2017 a man was injured outside of a residence after a grenade was thrown:

It seems, perhaps, that Sweden’s ultra-liberal, open-border, self-described feminist government is realizing they may have screwed up by allowing unchecked migration from Islamic countries associated with terrorism, violence, and perhaps containing people with an axe to grind against the West. As The Times notes:

Sweden has pursued a liberal immigration policy for more than a generation; its government speaks of being a “humanitarian superpower” for having taken in a large number of asylum seekers. After the migrant crisis of 2015, when more than 160,000 people sought asylum, the policy was abruptly changed. Yet there is little debate or reliable data about the integration of the 12% of the population that derive from non-western countries. For a long time the Swedish establishment played down the decay of immigrant-dominated suburbs, but it can no longer ignore the explosion of violence.

It should also be noted that 70% of migrants coming into Europe as of 2015 were men of fighting age according to a Pew Research Center study.

Even Swedish Democratic party leader Jimmie Akesson “declared war” against organized crime and suggested that Sweden should deploy the military to no-go zones to counter the out of control violence.

“People are shot to death in pizza restaurants, people are killed by hand grenades they find on the street,” Akesson said in parliament on Wednesday.

“This is the new Sweden; the new, exciting dynamic, multicultural paradise that so many here in this assembly … have fought to create for so many years,” he said sarcastically.

And now the Swedish government is distributing survivalism pamphlets (for war with Russia, of course) and considering deploying the military to deal with idealistic gun-toting migrant youth gangs from brutally war-torn countries.

Who could have possibly seen this coming?

7254,8264,Jesus to Judas,"For 15 years, Michel Aoun and the Free Patriotic Movement were the symbol, the inspiration, and the dream of Free Lebanon. The flame was kept alive through the few pure souls who believed in something greater than themselves; Free Lebanon. During those dark years, Michel Aoun was revered as our Nelson Mandela, or Che Guevara, our George Washington.

When he returned to Lebanon, he was met by hundreds of thousands. It was hoped that he would become the “Guardian of the Revolution”, instead, he sank into the narrow alleys of local politics, and then his true dimension was revealed.

The great Michel Aoun is gone forever. Today, in his place, we see a monster, a distortion, a maimed face, an ugly sight, a Syrian collaborator, a mentally deranged man, a border-line traitor and putchist. What happened to the platform upon which we elected the FPM members of parliament on? To move from self-sacrifice to self-benefit on national live-or-die issues is utterly unacceptable. Such betrayal of our people cannot be forgiven. The Lebanese did not elect Michel Aoun so that he bargains away our votes to the Syrian and Iranian dictatorships for his personal gain or vendetta. And none of your arguments sir, fool us. What Christian privileges are you trying to restore? We thought you were defending all Lebanese and not just the Christians.

Is it perhaps the first republic which you swore to protect and failed in that mission which you may be continuing to pursue? Perhaps you have never forgiven Walid Jumblat and all those who destroyed the first republic ushering the Syrian occupation, as by their own admission, then subsequently grabbing power at the expense of the country’s independence until stepped upon by the Syrian boot. Why can’t you forgive the new Walid Jumblat ?

He has repented publicly. Saint Paul, was a persecutor of Christians before he repented, but he did repent, and we revere him today. So why not forgive your past enemies as you claim to be doing today with the Syrian butchers who are still slaughtering us. Mr. Hariri, Mr. Jumblat, Amine Gemayel, and Samir Geagea are today the spearheads of the Cedars Revolution and they are fighting for our independence. The Christian constituency reveres true defenders of Lebanon regardless of their religion or background.

This is not to say that we need to be blind to the possible irregularities that occurred under occupation and all the ensuing corruption. Solidere, a multi-billion and now-global organization, owes to the old Beirut downtown owners to settle their grievances fairly and swiftly. Investigations should be launched into the corruption regime which prospered under the Syrian occupation. Such inquisitions would surely implicate many Syrian officials. Also investigations should be launched into the FPM transactions today as well. How did it acquire its radio and TV stations?

Is it really currently training a militia? How did Michel Aoun finance his party and did he receive any funds from Iranian or Syrian sources or their proxies? These investigations should be applied to all Lebanese parties and not just the FPM. The Lebanese people are owed integrity, decent, and honest political life and structures.

He swapped the austerity of idealism for the reality of materialism. He shed the holy robe of sacrifice then wore the mask of extortion. He transformed himself from a justice seeker to a vendetta vigilante. He threw away reason and adopted empty and opportunistic dogmatism. He left the temple and the heavens, for the catacombs and hell. He changed from a “Jesus” to a “Judas”, right in front of our eyes and history, shamelessly and brazenly. The amount of anger we have now towards Michel Aoun is far greater than any gratitude we may have had for his past stances. He is deeply divisive and despised today, and there is no way in heaven or hell that we will accept him as president",http://canadafreepress.com/article/jesus-to-judas,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

“Dan hears the screaming, rushes in, wrestles Alex into the bathtub, and seemingly drowns her. She suddenly emerges from the water, swinging the knife.” (Wikipedia summary of the 1987 movie, Fatal Attraction)

Favorable views of capitalism were 47% among Gen-Z; 42% among Millennials; and 45% among Generation X.

Marxism is like Alex in the movie Fatal Attraction. We thought it was dead as an ideology, but it keeps returning, swinging its hammer and sickle.

Bernie Sanders ran as a socialist and got much of the Democratic vote. A 2016 Harvard Youth Poll found that 51 percent of millennials rejected capitalism. A 2016 poll by YouGov found that favorable views of capitalism were 47 percent among Generation Z; 42 percent among Millennials; and 45 percent among Generation X.

Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York, the center of American capitalism, has recently complained that “private property rights” limit his ability to plan for New York. Yet he has just won a second term.

In the United Kingdom, the Labor Party’s Shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell, quoted from Mao Zedong on the floor of the House of Commons in 2015. He said, “To assist [Conservative Chancellor] comrade Osborne about dealing with his newfound comrades, I have brought him along Mao’s Little Red Book.”

Try. Fail. Repeat.

Communism’s failures are legion and well known. In the 20th century, Communist regimes killed about 100 million people: 20 million in Russia, 65 million in China, and the rest from a miscellany of countries including Vietnam, Cambodia, North Korea and others. North Korea is a failed country; South Korea is rich and prosperous. Similarly, East Germany was poor, and West Germany highly economically successful. Cuba is still poor. China’s economy has been growing as the Marxist influence has declined.

For those born after 1985, this is all ancient history.

But young people do not know this or ignore it. After all, the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, the Soviet Union was dissolved in 1991. For those born after about 1985, this is all ancient history. North Korea remains a failure, but that is nothing new if it is even known. The Cold War is before millennials’ time, and the fall of the Wall is something in a history book.

Of course, Venezuela is an ongoing disaster. People are starving, and even eating zoo animals. Professional women and young girls are turning to prostitution to make enough money to eat. Hundreds of thousands of people are leaving for Colombia or other countries, and the country has become a dictatorship.

But Bernie Sanders’ supporters may not know this, or may not know that it is the predictable result of the “socialism” that he advocates. And of course, the press does not generally indicate that the disaster is due to communism.

Folk Economics

Why do so many advocate a system which has failed whenever it has been tried? Communism is based on primitive economic thinking, what has been called “folk economics.” That is, Marxism appeals to those untrained in economics because it is consistent with our primitive beliefs about economics. This is ironic because Marx called his system “scientific socialism,” when in fact it is consistent with a pre-scientific view of the economy.

Zero-sum thinking is responsible for most of the major fallacies in economic policy.

Our intuitions about economics evolved in the long period called the Environment of Evolutionary Adaptedness when our ancestors were largely hunter-gatherers. During this period, societies were small, approximately 200 people or fewer; there was virtually no technological progress or economic growth, and the world was zero-sum. Because societies were mobile, there was little capital investment. This entire set of beliefs is exactly consistent with Marxism and its child, socialism.

One of the tenants of folk economics is that the world is largely zero-sum – economic values do not change in response to changes in prices. I have come to believe that this issue – zero-sum thinking – is responsible for most of the major fallacies in economic policy, such as tariffs and immigration restriction. One of the fundamental policies of Marxism is “From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.” Both halves of this proposal are based on zero-sum thinking. They ignore that output depends on incentives as well as ability and needs depend on prices as well as desires.

In a zero-sum world, the only way to become rich is to steal from others. There was no technological change and no investment, and so no possibilities of becoming rich by inventing a new stone ax, or investing in a growing industry. Therefore, prejudice against the rich is part of our evolved mental architecture. Class conflict (capital versus labor, or today’s version, race, class, and gender) is also a product of zero-sum thinking – the pie is viewed fixed, and the only relevant issues are the division of the pie. In fact, of course, labor and capital cooperate to produce output, and the amount of output depends on the rules governing use of inputs.

Another pillar of folk economics is that labor is the only source of value. This was true when our minds were evolving and there was relatively little capital but certainly is not true now. But the labor theory of value is part of communism. Folk economics does not understand invisible hand theories of social organization, and so communism requires central planning.

Advocates of scientific socialism are advocating a primitive view of the world.

While these primitive views are part of our evolved mental structure, it is certainly possible to learn that they are false. But the modern view of economics is not a natural way of thinking. Think of flat earth thinking: our intuition is that the earth is flat, but we can learn that it is not.

However, it is particularly ironic that those who profess a “deep” understanding of the economy, and the advocates of what Marx called scientific socialism, are actually advocating a primitive view of the world. Perhaps the best way to counter these views is to point out that they are primitive. Intellectuals do not want to be “on the wrong side of history” nor do they want to be science deniers.

Episode One of FEE’s new video series “How We Thrive” (for more on the series, see below) explores one of the world’s leading banjo manufacturing companies. Gold Tone Music Group was started by Robyn and Wayne Rogers, after many years of owning a music store in the small beachtown of Titusville, FL. Follow Robyn’s journey from owning a 1970s music store to entering the world of instrument manufacturing and pioneering the movement for affordable banjos and imaginative folk acoustic instruments. Her unique perspective and experience makes for an entertaining and empowering story of a modern day small business, who has made a respected name for itself in the extremely competitive world of music.

From the Director:

This episode is particularly special to me because I grew up with the Rogers family in Titusville, FL. Robyn is like a second mother to me, as she is to so many in this community. Over the years of starting my own company, I have called her countless times at different speed bumps and hoops I have come up to in my own journey.

Robyn has such an amazing intuition about business, knows how to tell it straight, but leaves you feeling empowered and hopeful to move forward. She is the perfect role model for Female Entrepreneurs, and I’m so grateful to get to share her story with the world. It took some convincing for her to agree to be a part of “How We Thrive”, saying she’s nothing special… She is truly one of the most humble people I know. I can’t wait for you to see this episode and see for yourself, what an inspiring businesswoman she is and reep the benefits of hearing her thoughts.

About the Series

“How We Thrive” is a docuseries profiling female entrepreneurs and the impact their businesses have made on the world. From one of the world’s more prolific banjo companies to a Senegalese entrepreneur trying to combat the poverty image – each episode follows the creation and growth of a specific company, the trials and tribulations experienced, and the knowledge gained – with the hopes of inspiring the next generation of entrepreneurs. After all, learning through the experience of others is one of the cornerstones of business. And while not always the easiest path, watching how each business learned to thrive in their specific environments shows just how rewarding taking such a risk can be. The idea is to show, while each company provides a different narrative, the similarities and common threads shared across each industry, location, and time. In short, there are specific characteristics shared by all entrepreneurs.

It’s also important to showcase the hardships each businesswoman faced – that the path to success is often wrought with hard work, sacrifice, perseverance, and a tenacity that would scare away most nine-to-fivers. Furthermore, business doesn’t happen in a vacuum. Business happens out of relationships, trial, failures, and a whole heck of a lot of determination. “How We Thrive” aims to expose the authentic journey to the top, avoiding society’s sugarcoated portrayal of success. Those who have created thriving businesses did not do so easily, and it’s truly inspiring to hear their stories and share in these victories.

We chose women who not only do business well, despite all of the roadblocks: funding, regulation, competitive markets, but women who are passionate about what they do – women who are striving to make a difference. They are not only making a living as their own boss, they are running companies that have purpose, societal impact, and are run with compassion for their employees as well as their clients.

Knowledge is a valuable resource to new entrepreneurs, and I saw a lack of it when I started my own company. To have a docuseries that can offer a little guidance in the entrepreneurial realm, in my mind, would benefit any company. These films are meant to help fill the void, and I truly hope many are inspired and challenged to, if not reevaluate their own motives for creating a business, at least have a broader understanding of the entrepreneurial life.

Read part 1 in this series here.

For those of us living in northerly regions, using an unheated greenhouse in the winter may seem far-fetched. And yet, it’s perfectly feasible. Even way up north in hardiness zone 3, a simple greenhouse covered with flimsy plastic sheeting can give you a winter harvest. Greenhouse “glazing” (be it plastic sheeting, or polycarbonate or glass panels) can help replicate the climate 1.5 zones to your south; and further coverings inside the greenhouse (such as floating row covers) can give you the leeway of another 1.5 zones. In this way, a zone 3 winter becomes a zone 6 winter. While zone 6 isn’t exactly tropical, its climate supports the growth of cold-hardy vegetables.

The key here is “cold-hardy.” An unheated greenhouse won’t do for heat- and sun-loving plants like tomatoes, peppers, or melons. But with a little thought, planning, and experimentation, you should be able to harvest salad greens, leeks, hardy root vegetables, and cool-weather Chinese greens during the winter months.

Building the Best Greenhouse

The location of your greenhouse and how it’s constructed will have a huge impact on your harvests. Before you start building, consider the following:

Ideally, a winter greenhouse should be situated against the south-facing wall of a house, garage, or outbuilding (such as a shed or chicken coop). That way, it will be protected from northerly winds while also benefiting from ambient heat.

If it’s not possible to build your greenhouse against an existing wall, its freestanding north-facing wall should be opaque (ideally painted black) so that it absorbs and retains heat.

Make sure the location isn’t shaded.

A foundation laid below the frost line will both protect against frost heave and insulate the soil within it.

The angle of the roof is crucial to capture the maximum amount of sunlight. Optimal roof angles differ depending on latitude. To figure out the best angle for your location, consult the Cold Climate Greenhouse Resource published by the University of Minnesota.

How Cold is Too Cold?

Depending on your hardiness zone, you may be able to get by solely with passive solar and ambient heating. In colder regions, you may need to supplement some warmth. There are a number of ways that you can generate and/or trap heat without resorting to electricity or fuel.

Especially if you are setting a foundation below the frost line anyway, a sunken greenhouse can provide the warmth plants — especially root vegetables — need. As the Cold Climate Greenhouse Resource explains, soil located 4 feet below the surface stays at a steady 40-50℉ regardless of air temperature.

Alternately, a trench or hole in the center of your greenhouse, filled with manure, will generate heat as the manure breaks down; and as a bonus, you will always have fertilizer easily at hand! Another option is to create heat sinks by filling black 55-gallon drums with water. The barrels absorb heat from the sun during the day and slowly release that heat at night. If you’re up for it, more complicated systems include solar heating and circulating water heated with solar power.

Regardless of how — or even if — you provide supplemental heat to your greenhouse, keep in mind that plants also need sunlight to thrive. During the shortest days of the year, growth will come to a standstill regardless of how warm your greenhouse is.

Choosing the Best Vegetable Varieties

As noted above, it’s essential to focus on cold-hardy vegetables for your unheated winter greenhouse. It may take some experimenting to find which varieties work best in your zone and your greenhouse’s microclimate, but to help you get started, consider these:

Cold-hardy salad greens, including endive, radicchio, kale, Swiss chard, spinach, arugula, collard, and mustard greens. Plant your greens in succession (perhaps one tray a week) and, when ready for harvest, cut what you need, leaving some green behind. The plants will continue to grow so that you get a second (and possibly third) harvest.

Root vegetables such as parsnips, beets, turnips, and carrots. As an added bonus, to deal with cold temperatures, root vegetables convert their starches to sugars, which act as a sort of natural anti-freeze. The increased sugars mean sweeter-tasting veggies.

Pak choi, Chinese cabbage, and other similar cool-weather Chinese greens.

Timing your Seedlings

It’s best to start your seeds in late summer or early fall so that your seedlings are well established before extreme cold hits. However, you can sow throughout the winter. If you choose to plant during the coldest months, start your seeds indoors or use a heat mat for seed propagation. Tender seedlings are more sensitive to the cold and need a solid start before they’re left 24/7 in an unheated greenhouse.

Why Bother?

You’re not alone if you’re wondering whether digging a four-foot “basement” for a greenhouse and calculating the optimal roof slant is more work than it’s worth. But, if you’re reading this, it goes without saying that you already know the benefits of gardening, whether in winter or summer: the joy of dirt under your fingernails; putting tasty, nutrient-dense produce on your table; cost-savings compared to purchasing bland supermarket vegetables; and self-sufficiency. Using an unheated greenhouse in the winter brings extra benefits, including the cost-savings over a heated greenhouse, supporting the environment, and the joy of proving those folks wrong, who think it’s impossible to grow fresh vegetables in the depths of winter.

9036,10225,The Cronyism behind Your Contact Lenses,"The Cronyism behind Your Contact Lenses

% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

Nothing is as frustrating than not being able to see. According to the The Vision Council Research (2015), 76 percent of the adult population in the US uses some sort of vision correction. About 40 million Americans use contact lenses, making it a $4.6 billion retail industry.

The production cost of contact lenses are fairly low, however, many people spend considerable amounts on, what is for them, a vital item in their daily lives. What holds people back from accessing affordable vision correction?

You Should (Literally) See through the Market

Patients who are unaware of their exact prescription will not choose to compare prices on the market.

In a Consumer Action survey released this year, it was revealed that close to one-third of respondents (31 percent) were not given a copy of their prescription after getting their contact lens exams at the eye doctor’s office. A poll by the same organization earlier this year revealed that 60 percent of patients are unaware that they have a legal right to their prescription copy.

In order to remedy against this intransparent handling, the Federal Trade Commission is proposing an update to the contact lens rules. The FTC wants to make it compulsory for practitioners to get a signature from the patient that he has understood that he holds the right to his files.

In a world in which people own (and realize that they own) access to their personal information, this would seem self-evident. Yet, in the absence of the general right to your own data, the FTC rule is actually a sensible solution. The American Optometric Association, “Big contact lens” if you like, lobbied D.C. against the change, for the reason that it would add bureaucracy.

It happens that Europe is actually ahead of the United States in this instance. With countries having virtually no prescription mandates (with the notable exception of the UK, which does require a valid prescription), lenses are as accessible as buying them through a vending machine, making the retail of these vending machine a business on its own.

Patients who are unaware of their exact prescription will not choose to compare prices on the market, which increases the bills for their vision corrections. As Consumer Action puts it:

They [consumers] should not be pressured to purchase during the exam process and they should leave their eye doctor’s office with a copy of their prescription in hand allowing them to comparison shop for the best price on the lenses they need.

It so happens that the financial services bill was rushed through the Senate committee: no hearing or vote took place. The Senate Is Blind

Appropriations Chairman Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-NJ) and Financial Services Subcommittee Chairman Tom Graves lead the House on the markup process, siding with consumers instead of lobbyists. No issue on this side. In the Senate however, things look very differently.

The American Optometric Association (AOA) calls for more “patient safety” instead of transparency into the process. Remember how this lobby group also called the FTC-change in the rules “increased bureaucracy”? If you do, then this passage (page 66) from the Senate’s appropriations report will sound oddly familiar:

The Committee is disappointed in the FTC’s decision not to include the proposed patient safety improvements related to the prescription verification process in its draft contact lens rule and instead impose new paperwork requirements on patients and doctors that are unnecessarily burdensome.”

The AOA’s $1.8 million lobbying expenses seem to be well invested indeed.

Could it be that Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.V.) is deliberately trying to keep the process intransparent for consumers, so that certain industries will continue to make money off of uninformed patients?

In fact, it so happens that the financial services bill was rushed through the Senate committee: no hearing or vote took place, as Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) said there was only “little time” to finalize the appropriations bills for the fiscal year 2018. The senators even conclusively tapped themselves on the back as Cochran called the process “careful and deliberative.” The senator supposedly uses a very different dictionary.

No Rules, No Cronyism

Ultimately, the political process in Washington D.C. requires transparency as much as any other, and in fact, the House needs to be congratulated for combatting special interests on this issue.

The larger point, however, must be no rules, no cronies. Americans can look to Europe and its absence of prescription rules as a solution to the problems of cronies invading the nation’s capital.

119,143,Guy Exposes Scam Popular Restaurant Pulls On Millions Of People A Year (video),"If you are educated in advertising then you probably know a bit about the mind games that advertisers play in order to get their customers to get hooked and become consumers of their products. Advertisers are so gifted that they can even make you think that drinking alcohol is healthy and will make you more successful in both the bedroom and the office.When it comes to advertising, it’s all about the image. It’s for this reason that billboards across America show a sexy woman drinking a martini or a glass of wine, eluding to the fact that she booze will give her liquid courage and make her appear like she’s got it all together.

The same goes for those old-school cigarette commercials. Remember when they made it look like you’d instantly transform into a strong and healthy cowboy. Considering smokers are much more likely to lose their lives to lung cancer, then these ads are far from believable.

A similar trick of the eye scheme was exposed at a fast food restaurant recently, and it was all caught on camera. When one clever person realized that the unknown restaurant was selling three different sized beverages, that were essentially the same size, they decided to film it and show the world exactly how the soda fit into the small, medium and large sizes. Yet, the company was selling them for three different prices, the largest one costing the most amount of money of course.

In the video, you can see that the three cups are all shaped different, yet they give the appearance that the large is the tallest of the three, as to be expected. But if you look closely, the largest cup has a very narrow bottom, making it appear that it is tall but it is actually very thin at the bottom. The smallest cup appears to be very similar to the medium sized cup, however; it must be a tad wider than the medium cup in order to fit the same amount.

In any event, if you are a lover of fast food, then you should beware of this type of scam. These restaurants are probably making loads of dough all because of this little trick of the eye. Be smarter than them and ask to see the cups up close before you make a purchase and decide on a drink size. It may be in your best interest to always pay for a small cup, considering it’s essentially the exact same size as the large for the same amount of money. Or, you can really be sure and purchase yourself a bottle of soda at a nearby convenience store.

There is a good chance that restaurants are doing this type of advertising with their other products as well. Maybe that super-sized meal isn’t as super-sized as you thought it was. As they say….looks can be deceiving. Sometimes it’s best to do your homework when it comes to sizes and prices at restaurants before you fork over your hard-earned cash.",http://awm.com/guy-exposes-scam-popular-restaurant-pulls-on-millions-of-people-a-year-video/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
6328,7242,Why America Is One Nation Under God - Not a Nation of Lawyers,"Opinions vary on the topic, between those of religion and those without. They vary between the politically motivated - those who believe in morality based self-governance versus those who seek mans dominion over men through man-made, man-interpreted and man-enforced laws. They even vary among believers, some of whom believe in an unwritten separation of church and state versus others who believe only in that which was actually written into our Constitution by the founders.

If you are looking for a debate, few topics will so readily attract opposition. Is it a question of faith or historical fact? It’s hard to get folks to even agree on that. Then you will have to somehow separate fact from fiction, as the reporting of these facts is often more hysterical than historical.

Those who wish America a godless society have developed a plethora of arguments to support their agenda. But arguments are not facts… We watch as lawyers make arguments every day, seldom concerned with any facts or even any sense of real justice. But they can make an argument, sometimes a very successful argument. If their argument is not true, has justice been served? Is the argument right if it was made on a premise that was all wrong, even though the argument is effective?

America is and has always been One Nation Under God. Though the founders used generic terms like Creator to describe that God, the God they meant was their God, of the Christian faith. Atheists and agnostics have long argued that many of the founders were deists, using Washington, Jefferson, Franklin, Paine, Hamilton, and Madison as proof. However, in each of these cases, a study of their personal writings will debunk the myth.

How did America become One Nation Under God? In dictionaries, the terms “deist,” “agnostic,” and “atheist” appear as synonyms. On this basis, the term deists would include those who believe there is no God, those who believe in a distant, impersonal creator of the universe and those who believe there is no way to know if God exists.

A brief study of the founders own writings prove beyond any reasonable doubt that none of the notable founders fit this description. Thomas Paine talked about “the error of schools” to teach sciences without “reference to the Being who is author of them: for all the principles of science are of Divine origin.” He stated that “the evil that has resulted from the error of the schools in teaching [science without God] has been that of generating in the pupils a species of atheism.”

Benjamin Franklin’s 1749 plan of education for public schools in Pennsylvania insisted that schools teach “the necessity of a public religion . . . and the excellency of the Christian religion above all others, ancient or modern.” Franklin proposed a Biblical inscription for the Seal of the United States; he chose a New Testament verse for the motto of the Philadelphia Hospital; he was one of the chief proponents of a paid chaplain in Congress; and when Franklin helped found the college which bore his name in 1787, it was dedicated as “a nursery of religion and learning” built “on Christ, the Corner-Stone.”

On May 2, 1778, George Washington charged his soldiers at Valley Forge that “To the distinguished character of patriot, it should be our highest glory to add the more distinguished character of Christian.” In a speech on May 12, 1779, he claimed that what children needed to learn “above all” was the “religion of Jesus Christ,” and that to learn this would make them “greater and happier than they already are.” On June 8, 1783, he reminded the nation that “without a humble imitation” of “the Divine Author of our blessed religion” we “can never hope to be a happy nation”, as he resigned his post as Commander-in-Chief. Washington’s own adopted daughter declared of Washington that you might as well question his patriotism as to question his Christianity.

Hamilton began work with the Rev. James Bayard to form the Christian Constitutional Society to help spread over the world the two things which Hamilton said made America great: (1) Christianity and (2) a Constitution formed under Christianity. Only Hamilton’s death two months later thwarted his plan of starting a missionary society to promote Christian government.

Thomas Jefferson himself declared, “I am a real Christian, that is to say, a disciple of the doctrines of Jesus.” As President of the United States, Jefferson signed a treaty with the Kaskaskia tribe wherein he provided—at the government’s expense—Christian missionaries.

James Madison trained for ministry with the Rev. Dr. John Witherspoon, and Madison’s writings are replete with declarations of his faith in God and in Christ. In his letter to Attorney General Bradford, Madison laments that public officials are not bold enough about their Christian faith in public and that public officials should be “fervent advocates in the cause of Christ.” Madison did allude to a “wall of separation,” but contemporary writers frequently omit Madison’s own definition of that “wall”, which according to Madison, was only to prevent Congress from passing a national law to establish a national religion.

There you have it… Do any of these men sound like deists to you? It is not hard to demonstrate that America was indeed born One Nation under God or that the God or Creator they were referring to was in fact, Jesus Christ. This alone should lay to rest any honest debate over how America became a nation built upon Judeo-Christian principles and values. We can go on and on, founder after founder if you want, but these are the men named by most who argue that the founders were at best, deists.

Why was America formed as One Nation Under God? The answer is simple, yet of vital importance to every American, regardless of their religious beliefs. The answer begins with these two words, “self-governance”.

Patrick Henry put it this way, “It cannot be emphasized too strongly or too often that this great nation was founded not by religionists but by Christians, not on religions but on the Gospel of Jesus Christ”.

John Adams said it this way, “We Recognize No Sovereign but God, and no King but Jesus! [April 18, 1775] and he later explained, “We have no government armed with power capable of contending with human passions unbridled by morality and religion. Avarice, ambition, revenge, or gallantry, would break the strongest cords of our Constitution as a whale goes through a net. Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.”—October 11, 1798

The point is this - it is historically indisputable that America was born One Nation under God. It does not require faith, but instead common logic to understand why. Men without a moral compass are incapable of long-term self-governance. The founders knew it because they had seen it. Few modern Americans have experienced what life would be like in a godless society, void of morality, so they question it. Many Americans place their trust in man over God, so they pursue it.

But there is no question what America was, is, should be or must be in order to retain its position of strength as the freest nation of self-governed individuals on earth. We will either be free as One Nation under God, or we will be a nation of fools unaware of our common heritage and on the road to ruin under men in search of power. One does not have to be a Christian to understand this. One must only understand man and his insatiable hunger for power.

Those in search of that power must remove God from society in order to gain access to that power. Those who allow them, do so at their own peril. You are of course free to not like this simple truth. But this truth will never change. It is as it has always been…and shall always be.

(Naturalhealth365) Nearly 610,000 Americans die of heart disease in the United States every year, making it the leading cause of mortality in the nation. According to holistic cardiologist Joel Kahn, MD, many of these deaths are completely avoidable. (and, I couldn’t agree more with that statement)

In fact, Dr. Kahn asserts that almost 80 percent of heart disease is preventable with simple lifestyle changes. Obviously, the right nutrition (and attitude) is essential to healing the heart and maintaining a strong cardiovascular system. Yet, too many people remain in the dark about the proper way to effectively prevent cardiovascular issues. (plus, in many cases, the significance of “prevention” is often overlooked)

Discover a natural way to avoid heart disease. On the next NaturalHealth365 Talk Hour, Jonathan Landsman and Joel Kahn, MD, will talk about the role of a plant-based diet in healing and reversing heart disease. Learn how “eating clean” can ward off serious chronic health problems and lead to increased vitality and well-being. If you’re concerned about cardiovascular disease – or simply want to explore the anti-aging health benefits of a comprehensive lifestyle approach – this show is a great place to start.

Plant-based nutrition slashes the risk of heart disease – without harming the body

According to Dr. Kahn, diets laden with animal products – such as conventional meat, eggs and dairy – can exact a heavy toll on the health of humans and the environment. This is largely due to the fact that commercially produced animal-based foods are often loaded with pesticides, herbicides, antibiotics and synthetic hormones – which are used within the production process. (not to mention the inhumane treatment of all these animals)

In addition, animal-based diets increase the odds of developing potentially life-threatening diseases – which is why we often hear such great health outcomes from the replacement of these toxic foods with better choices. (none of which will occur without the right information)

For example, studies have shown that replacing even a small amount of animal proteins in the diet with plant proteins dramatically reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes.

Another example: NAFLD – or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease – is characterized by excess fat in the liver, and is rapidly reaching epidemic proportions in the United States. (NAFLD can lead to more serious liver conditions, including liver cancer). Dr. Kahn notes that increased dietary proteins from animal sources can cause a 50 percent rise in the risk of developing NAFLD.

The statistics speak for themselves…

Eating cured red meat — such as bacon or hot dogs — over four times a week raises risk of asthma by 76 percent.

The World Health Organization analysis reveals that eating cured meats substantially raises the risk of colorectal cancer. (Eating plant-based foods will most definitely help to keep the colon clean and dramatically lower the risk)

And, finally, eating red meat can raise risk of stomach cancer by up to 80 percent – and the risk of head and neck cancers by 50 percent.

The good news: healthier, plant-based diets are catching on with the general population. Dr. Kahn reports that nearly 40 percent of Americans choose to avoid meat entirely when eating out at restaurants and opting for plant-based choices instead.

Forewarned is fore-armed: Learn the surprising warning signs of “silent” heart disease

While Dr. Kahn reports that his goal is to prevent heart attacks completely, he characterizes early detection of cardiovascular disease as the “next best thing.”

Underlying “silent” (symptomless) coronary heart disease can cause problems years before an actual heart attack. Catching heart disease early allows patients time to make the changes in lifestyle and medical therapies that can delay – or even prevent – the onset of a heart attack.

Keep in mind, too often, the first sign of heart disease is a heart attack!

So, let’s talk about some of the ‘lesser known’ (early) warning signs. Severe baldness at the crown of the head can be a warning sign of heart disease. And it applies to women as well. In one study of over 7,000 participants (including 4,000 women), researchers found that moderate to severe baldness doubled the risk of dying from heart disease.

Graying hair can indicate a risk for heart atherosclerosis – or clogging of the coronary arteries. Although graying is sometimes just a symptom of getting older, scientists have found that having equal amounts of gray and dark hair — or mainly gray and white hair – corresponded with incidence of symptomless heart blockages.

Another odd sign of possible heart disease is having a diagonal crease in the earlobe. This phenomenon, which may be caused by poor circulation, is associated with raised heart disease risk. Pain in the calf when walking is another possible sign of atherosclerosis that should not be ignored – particularly if the patient smokes cigarettes.

And, finally, (as I have often warned over the year) dental issues like root canal treated teeth can dramatically increase your risk of a heart attack – due to the constant toxic load of bacteria that stem from ‘dead teeth.’

Don’t become an unwanted medical statistic. Tune into the next NaturalHealth365 Talk Hour for some great advice about strengthening the heart and improving the quality of your life.

6653,7610,Rutland: How a Mayor Conspired in Secret to Resettle Syrians in Small Vermont Town,"Last year, the mayor of a small town in Vermont met in secret with representatives of the refugee resettlement industry, offering his town as a new resettlement destination for unvetted Syrian migrants. In beginning these negotiations, Rutland mayor Chris Louras violated the city charter and set off a firestorm of protest throughout the city and in surrounding communities.

The mayor announced the proposal in late April to resettle a hundred Syrian refugees beginning in October of this year. While he hid the negotiations from the rest of the local government and its citizens, Louras engaged with the Vermont Refugee Resettlement Program (VRRP), a field office of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants (USCRI). USCRI is one of nine private contractors called “Voluntary Agencies” or VOLAGs, authorized by the State Department to resettle refugees.

A public records request has revealed extensive details of how this plan was hatched.

From the start, those involved stressed secrecy in order to prevent criticism from voices in the community. Vermont Refugee Resettlement Program Director Amila Merdzanovic said “I cannot emphasize enough the importance of not sharing the information… move slowly, keep it to a small circle of people, and then expand.” In an email to Louras, she stated, “if we open it up to anybody and everybody, all sorts of people will come out of the woodwork. Anti-immigrant, anti-anything.”

Merdzanovic later told ABC News that, “in this work, you’re gonna offend people. Whether you include them or not include them, you’re gonna offend them. So sometimes you just have to make that hard decision” to deceive the citizens who will be impacted by these decisions.

Secrecy is also essential because those involved need to line up support from vendors, non-profits and others who will feed off the flood of taxpayer dollars that accompany refugee resettlement.

The U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants received $52 million in 2015 to resettle approximately 9,000 refugees, translating to about $5,800 per head. This doesn’t take into account taxpayer spending on welfare programs for refugees or the many grants available to refugees through the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement.

The secrecy in which the refugee resettlement process is conducted lends itself to the appearance of conflicts of interest, fraud and pay-for-play allegations. There is virtually no transparency and a lot of money in government contracts at stake.

In an email dated March 8, 2016, retrieved through a public records request, the mayor wrote to Merdzanovic, “We have expanded the group of ‘those who know,’ and are ready to have those discussions you’ve requested with potential employers and landlords…”

Merdzanovic responds excitedly in a later email, “As it turns out, one of our English teacher’s brothers is a major landlord and an employer in Rutland…”

On May 25, Rutland’s Board of Aldermen invited the Vermont Refugee Resettlement Program’s Merdzanovic and USCRI’s Director of Community Relations Stacie Blake to answer questions at a public meeting. The meeting revealed a well of hostility toward the resettlement agencies and the mayor for deliberately going behind their backs.

Residents repeatedly complained about the secrecy shrouding the resettlement process, and demanded the mayor and the resettlement contractors allow the community to decide the issue.

A citizen’s organization called Rutland First rapidly formed to protest the mayor’s actions. It has petitions for both the town and city to put the resettlement program to a vote.

4270,4838,The Ultimate In Irony: Syrian Army Rolls Into Idlib With US Weapons Captured From ISIS,"The Ultimate In Irony: Syrian Army Rolls Into Idlib With US Weapons Captured From ISIS

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

Authored by Leith Fadel and Andrew Illingworth of Al-Masdar News,

The Syrian Arab Army’s (SAA) Tiger Forces arrived in northern Hama this week with a big surprise from their previous operations in the Deir Ezzor Governorate. Units from the Tiger Forces were seen armed with US-manufactured weapons that were seized from the Islamic State (ISIS) during the two month long battle in Deir Ezzor.

According to a military source in Hama, the Syrian Army’s Tiger Forces are planning to use the US-manufactured weapons against the jihadist rebels in the upcoming battle for the Idlib Governorate. Among the US-manufactured weapons transferred to the Idlib front were a large number of TOW missiles that were previously supplied by Washington to the rebel forces in Syria before they were later sold to the Islamic State.



Screenshot via Conflict Armament Research video documentation of weapons recovered from ISIS initially supplied through a CIA program to arm anti-Assad militants.

The rapid defeat of Islamic State forces in eastern Syria over the last several months has seen the Syrian Arab Army capture untold quantities of military equipment from the terrorist group, most of which will likely go into the raising of new pro-government formations. As Syrian pro-government forces chased ISIS out of its main strongholds along the western shore of Euphrates River, the jihadist faction never had the time to re-locate its weapons stockpiles. The inevitable result of this was that such stockpiles came into the possession of the Syrian Army.

As video evidence has shown time and time again, the vast loot accumulated thus far comprises not only small arms, but also heavy weapons including mortars, howitzers, field guns, technicals, armored personnel carriers, main battle tanks and guided missiles.

https://twitter.com/TheArabSource/status/941481070419152896

Despite the fact that some Western-made weapon systems (particularly artillery and anti-tank missiles) were found, by far most of the equipment is of Soviet design (the CIA/Pentagon program to arm anti-Assad militants shipped mostly Soviet arms via Eastern Europe to US-backed groups). This means that the Syrian Army, itself possessing Soviet-made/Russian weapons, has compatible ammunition and spare parts to maintain the captured weapons and thus has the ability to press them into service.

Utilizing this huge captured arsenal, it is expected that the Syrian Army will raise new formations, not only within its own service, but also within pro-government militias – namely the National Defense Forces. In addition to raising new units of local fighters whose job it is to protect recently liberated territories throughout the provinces of Homs, Hama and Deir Ezzor, the army’s 5th Assault Corps formation is also predicted to expand.

To this end, the sheer amount of arms captured from ISIS ensures that many thousands of fresh recruits can be quickly provided with assault rifles and rocket launchers as well as the fire support assets their new units will require.

There isn’t a giant that God can’t handle. The Blood of Jesus is mightier than ANYTHING! Apply it.

ARE YOU COMPLETELY PREPARED & PROTECTED?

The Bible tells us that every human has sinned and fallen short of the glory of God which is is a heart-penetrating truth. He has provided a way to cleanse us of our sins since we can never be “good enough” to cleanse ourselves. That avenue to God’s grace, mercy and forgiveness (the cleansing of our sins) is through His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ of Nazareth Who is equally God.

Not one of us are guaranteed a “tomorrow”. Has your time run out? Will you continue to ignore the promptings of God the Holy Spirit or have you awakened to the essential need for God, risking eternal damnation?

​​God the Holy Father, God the Holy Son and God the Holy Spirit are One God, the true, living, uncreated God Who is ever-present, all knowing, all powerful and all loving. He desires that every single person be forgiven, saved and to live eternally with Him. He is our only real protection and His love for you is unchanging. Accept Jesus Christ as your Savior, the true Messiah, today.

You can’t take your salvation for a test drive. You’re all-in or not.

Admit to Him that you are a sinner in need of forgiveness, that you are truly sorry for your sins. Acknowledge that He died for your sins, rose from the dead and lives forevermore. Invite Him into your life and to help you to turn from sin. Rejoice! You just became a Christian! Now trust in Him and get to know Him through the Bible which tells us everything we need to know and through prayer/talking to Him. He eagerly desires relationship with you.

7347,8379,The Right to Resist Evil Leaders—The Christian History,"In the previous article we asked, “Do Americans have a right to oppose unjust authority?” Such a right was obviously assumed by the Founders. We likewise examined whether Christians have such a right, as well. In answer, we found the earliest theories regarding what became Resistance Theory resulted from the assumptions of the Protestant Reformation being applied to society during various crises involving early Protestant communities. Therefore, whether such a right truly exists, the entire theory was proposed by Protestants, using biblical, historic and classical arguments, ostensibly to achieve Christian ends.

The St Bartholomew’s Day Massacre , on August 24, 1572, put the French Calvinists, or Huguenots of France, in a precarious position, according to Quentin Skinner in The Foundations of Modern Political Thought, Vol. 2: The Age of Reformation . Up to the point of the massacre, the Huguenots had been able to negotiate the relationship between themselves and the French Catholics. In fact, it is not clear what happened that caused such an utter breakdown that all Huguenots became endangered, and more than 10,000 slaughtered during the ensuing days. But Catherine de Medici, leader of France, ordered the death of the leader of the French Huguenots, sparking the massacre.

Yet, as we shall see below, and against the popular perceptions—not only do Lutherans claim the glory for outlining Resistance Theory, but the actual foundation of the idea was ¬†built from Catholic theologians. The idea of Resistance, which in its Calvinist incarnation includes the transition from a religious to a secular argument for the basis of society, the concept of Popular Sovereignty, and the right of individual, versus state resistance. The option of armed revolt to remove an unjust leader was also developed, and the possibility of a tyrannicide, or the potential killing of a tyrant as a last option, was even justified.

The St Bartholomew’s Day Massacre began when Admiral Gaspard de Coligny, leader of the Huguenots, was assassinated in his room, and his body dragged through the streets, bereft of head, hands and genitals, according to John Witte, Jr. in The Reformation of Rights. It did not help to tamp down conspiracy speculations that the head of the government was Catherine de Medici, daughter of the man to whom Niccolo Machiavelli dedicated his infamous, godless masterpiece, The Prince.

Francois Hotman

Francois Hotman, in his immortal Francogallia, helped broaden the appeal of Huguenot Right of Resistance theory by suggesting that the lesser officials the Lutherans termed “magistrates,” that they stated were appointed by God, were just as importantly man-chosen representatives. This presaged a larger move away from religious to secular theories in the Huguenot defensive strategy. But Hotman’s work, which used an historical approach to suggest ancient kings were chosen by the people, and therefore should be seen as representative authorities, was simply not up to the task of creating a modern argument for Resistance against current, unjust authority.

But a need for such a cutting-edge theory bubbled under the surface of French society. Suffice it to say that the intrigue which surrounded Catherine de Medici made certain as to stoke the fires of fear and create an incipient sense of the need for a theory of self-defense. This, as much as any other factor, helped push the Calvinist Huguenots towards developing a robust theory of self-defense and Right of Resistance.

II. Calvin, Beza & Mornay: Natural Law Theory

The need for an updated theory of the Right of Resistance was acutely felt by the Huguenot community, certain another government-sponsored massacre was right around the corner.

John Calvin

John Calvin, regarded the greatest Protestant theologian in history, and the leader of the church in Geneva, was a reluctant supporter of Resistance Theory. Yet, toward the end of his life, the famously cautious author moved closer to embracing the need for allowing spirited rejection of the powers that be, under certain, well-proscribed circumstances.

Needing a strong fix, the next generation of rights theory turned to the Natural Law, scholasticism and Roman law radical constitutionalism, claims Skinner. They argued that earliest mankind lived a nomadic existence of radical liberty. Humans were consumed with simple survival, unencumbered by society or legal restriction. And it was only when men began to live a settled existence, that some tried to deprive the liberty of others. In such a society of total freedom, any legitimate government must be built from the consent of all members.

Theodore Beza

These writers of the new Calvinist Resistance Theory, such as Theodore Beza and Philippe de Mornay, hearkened back to Catholic Concilliar Theory, which placed the locus of authority not in the Pope, but in the see of Cardinals. It is therefore ironic that the materials used to build Calvinist Resistance Theory were all borrowed from earlier Catholic thinkers. This is easier to understand when we consider the Huguenots needed to persuade the French society at large, still mostly Catholic in its sentiments.

Theodore Beza (1519-1605) was a French Protestant Christian theologian and scholar was the handpicked successor to Calvin. He wrote,

If the magistrate rules properly, the people, must obey him. But if the magistrate exceeds his authority, the people, through their representatives, have not only the right but also the duty of conscience to resist such tyranny. No magistrate should be suffered who has fundamentally breached the covenant he had sworn to God and his people. To suffer such a tyrant would insult God who had called all rulers to represent his divine being and authority on earth and to strive for divine justice and equity for all of God’s people.

Philippe de Mornay

Philippe de Mornay (1549-1623) was a French military captain, a diplomat, a man of letters and a theologian. He offered a sophisticated view of a proper society, stating that a good commonwealth is established by at least the consent of the majority, which he based upon the installation of Saul as King in Israel. In the Quaestio of his Defense, Mornay establishes that all persons were living in a state of liberty before entering society. Further, that the only purpose for the existence of leaders is the protection and security of the people, especially of their natural rights. And that whenever the leader fails to protect these rights, but menaces them, the people have a natural right to remove the leader. John Locke would take up these same themes a century later.

Mornay details that in a large state, it is acceptable, and even inevitable that representatives be chosen for the people. Further, the relationship is stated as a contract, with covenants between the king and God, the people and God, and the people and the king. The contract, or Lex Regia, is explicitly set up between the king and the people, and is predicated upon the king pursuing the welfare of the people and protecting their rights. But the agreement between the people and the king is a secular contract, or a pactum, and not a religious agreement, or foedus—covenant.

Mornay goes on to explain the duty of the people to the king is conditional, but the reciprocal duty of the king to the people is absolute—because the king arises from the people, but not the people from the king. The king who fails to protect the people and their rights is a tyrant, whereas if the people act without fidelity, they are seditious. The doctrine of Popular Sovereignty naturally arises from such an understanding, while the Right of Resistance is merely a natural outcome of the leader’s manifest failure.

Calvinist Resistance Theory v. Thomism

And herein lies a disagreement between two rival camps. The Huguenots taught that since all persons naturally live in freedom, until entering society—but will only remain as long as their king is not a tyrant, then the authority always lies with the people. Conversely, the Thomist camp, which contains Aquinas, Grotius and Pufendorf teach the king, as legibus solutus, is an absolute sovereign. He enjoys an absolute right to all actions, and is above even his own laws, while in office.

This pseudo-papist argument is confuted by the church’s Conciliar Theory. Further, John Locke decisively rejects this argument from the pen of Robert Filmer and his Divine Right of Kings, first articulated by the French Bodin. Beza teaches that the king, as a servant of the commonwealth—servus republicae—is under every single law, just as any other citizen. Beza writes, “there is not a single law to which the ruler is not bound in the conduct of his government, since he has sworn to be the protector and preserver of them all.” Thus, the right of popular resistance is also a duty.

The works of Beza and Mornay signaled the end of the notion that the only acceptable theory of the Right of Resistance was religious. Instead, two covenants existed in the society, representing both religion and secular rule. Therefore arose a theory of defensible popular revolt based upon natural law and the natural rights of citizens in defense of their popular sovereignty and natural rights.

III. Scotland, Buchanan & the Secular Right of Popular Resistance

George Buchanan

Scotland became the most Calvinist of nations in spite of Catholic Queen Mary. This caused the Calvinists to restate their religious duties as secular rights, until she was deposed. And it was the humanist trained, Reform minded George Buchanan (1506-1582) who helped create the arguments necessary for the first Calvinist revolution, in his Right of the Kingdom in Scotland. Buchanan criticized corruption in church and state during the Scottish Reformation. He was famed as a scholar and a Latin poet.

As a humanist, Buchanan accepted the stoic version of the rise of mankind, quoting Cicero, who wrote, “There was a time when men wandered at large in the fields like animals,” until society finally arose. Interestingly, Buchanan evolves the theory so completely from the Huguenots that he never even mentions the covenant with God, making society’s relationship with its king purely secular. This maneuver was echoed by Johannes Althuis in his highly influential Politics. This maneuver allowed the Reformers to present a theory which not only avoided sectarianism, but also represented every member of society, religious, or not.

This sea-change represents the transition from theology to politics, and from religious duties to natural rights. Buchanan then developed a radical theory of popular sovereignty. While there may be intermediary leaders who assist in the duties of the kingdom, these are mere secular ministers, who do not claim sovereignty, which stays with the people. Therefore, leaders are chosen directly by the people, who also retain the right to be directly involved with his removal for cause.

IV. Mariana’s Jesuit Catholic Right of Popular Resistance

Finally, the radical Jesuit Father Juan de Mariana (1536-1624), in his work The King and the Education of the King, in Book VI, asks if a tyrannical king can be removed? After mentioning the preferred method of removal by Assembly, Mariana then states that since it is the people that seat the king, they can also remove him, because a king is merely on the level of a paid employee, being a helmsman and guide (gubernator, rector). Further, while exploring what happens when the Assembly does not remove the king, Mariana allows that a private citizen may do any action himself to remove the king without fear of breaking the law or acting immorally.

Conclusion

In this second installment of the development of the Right of Resistance to bad rulers, we see how the Reformers created a theory which was based upon Natural Law and Roman jurisprudence, not merely biblical precepts. By the time Buchanan and Mariana were finished, there was no more agreement between God, only the people and the king. And this was based wholly upon the free will of the people. Moreover, the king could be removed directly by the people, who no longer needed to wait for the lesser-magistrates to act. This is because the people had a radical version of popular sovereignty, and acted directly to install the king—who if he did not protect the safety and natural rights of the people—could be directly removed.

In the next essay, the last in the series, we will consider how John Locke put the theory of Right to Resistance into his own words, which the American Founders then used to justify the US War of Independence, which merely changed the entire world.",http://canadafreepress.com/article/the-right-to-resist-evil-leaders-the-christian-history1,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

No foreign aid to Palestinians—a US interest!



President Trump should cut/suspend/terminate foreign aid to the Palestinian Authority and UNRWA, since they have undermined US values and national security interests, by abusing US foreign aid to promote hate-education and terrorism. President Trump should follow in the footsteps of effective and moral law-enforcement and homeland security authorities, who sustain and intensify their pursuit of criminals and terrorists, in defiance of the latter’s threats to escalate rogue operations. Western national leaders and police chiefs who succumb to—rather than defy and uproot - threats by rogue and criminal elements betray their constituents.

Suspending/ending foreign aid to the Palestinian Authority and UNRWA would reflect a decision to avoid - rather than repeat - failed policies by previous US Presidents, which provided a financial tailwind to Palestinian terrorism and hate-education, thus undermining US interests, including the pursuit of peace. If implemented, President Trump’s policy may trigger short-term aggravation of violence, but would bolster the long-term US posture of deterrence and homeland security, by delivering a lucid message of determination to combat—rather than appease—terrorism. A realistic worldview should be aware that there is no free lunch… If implemented, Trump’s policy may reflect the realization that funding and tolerating terror-oriented regimes (just like indulging crime-lords) does not transform them into democratic and law-abiding regimes, but adds fuel to the fire of hate-education, veneration of suicide-bombers, financial support of terrorists’ families and overall violence. Sacrificing realism—as costly, challenging and complex as it may be - on the altar of simplistic and tempting wishful-thinking transmits a message of vacillation, which generates a tailwind to anti-US - and a headwind to pro-US - entities throughout the globe. President Trump may become the first US President to realize that UNRWA has not solved—but exasperated, inflated and misrepresented—the Palestinian refugee reality at the expense of the US taxpayer and the war on terrorism. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has resolved and settled - since 1945 - the refugee status of almost 100MN refugees throughout the globe with 6,400 employees. In contrast, UNRWA—which was established in 1949 as a 2-3 year relief agency - has perpetuated and misrepresented the refugee status of the 320,000 1948 Palestinian refugees, employing 30,000 people.

While the UNHCR forbids the inheritance/perpetuation of refugee status, UNRWA applies the refugee status liberally and in perpetuity to future generations, including Arab foreign laborers who were in the country for only two years before the eruption of the 1948/49 War. President Trump’s position is based on US national security interests, realizing that the Palestinians have systematically sided with anti-US regimes, beginning with Nazi Germany, through the Soviet Bloc, the Ayatollahs, Saddam Hussein, Bin-Laden, North Korea, Venezuela, Cuba and China, training anti-US international terrorists from Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America, subverting and terrorizing Arab regimes. Therefore, Arabs have limited their support of the Palestinians to mostly talk, refraining from (any) military and (significant) financial walk. Withholding financial support from the Palestinian Authority may reflect the growing awareness of the marginal role played by the Palestinian issue, compared to the prime challenges facing the US in the Middle East (none of which is related to the Palestinian issue, either directly or indirectly): the Ayatollahs’ conventional machete at the throat of the pro-US Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Oman; the Ayatollahs’ violent expansion—facilitated by US policy - through Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen; the Ayatollahs’ subversive and terror involvement in Africa and Latin America; the nuclearization of the Ayatollahs (through collaboration with North Korea); the inherent vulnerability of the pro-US regimes in Jordan and Egypt; and the burgeoning profile of Russia and China in the Middle East and the Persian Gulf. The dramatic transformation of US policy toward foreign aid to the Palestinians, may express the realization that the Palestinian issue is not the crux of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Furthermore, it may signal the awakening of US policy-makers to the fact that US interests, and the Arab-Israeli peace process, may be better served by the US refraining from the introduction of initiatives, which have never been successful. In fact, the only two successful peace initiatives were directly initiated between Israel-Egypt (1977-1979) and Israel-Jordan (1994), with the US playing a most critical role in the conclusion—not initiation—of the processes. Learning from—rather than repeating—past mistakes should lead the US to cut/suspend/terminate its foreign aid to the Palestinian Authority and UNRWA. Moreover, according to the 2017 annual poll by Gallup, it would be consistent with the state-of-mind of the American people: 71% favorability of Israel, compared with 24% of the Palestinian Authority.

8016,9087,14 Common Gum Ingredients That Are Worse Than Chewing Tobacco,"Source: www.healthwyze.org | Original Post Date: April 23, 2010 –

We’re committed to offering our readers the best possible information to help everyone live and enjoy a happier and healthier life. This means that we’re always searching for the next solution for any of life’s many problems and exploring it in a way that best applies to your everyday life.

Sometimes, there is content that’s perfect just the way it is. In this case, we are very lucky to be collaborating with the people behind this valuable article and have been granted permission to republish it. We encourage you to visit their website at the end of this post.

People do not typically ingest gum, so they pay very little attention to its ingredients. The assumption is that if the gum is not swallowed, then the ingredients should not be a concern. However, the ingredients in gum travel into the bloodstream faster and in higher concentrations than food ingredients, because they absorb directly through the walls of the mouth, and these ingredients do not undergo the normal filtration process of digestion.

Gum is typically the most toxic product in supermarkets that is intended for internal use, and it is likely to kill any pet that eats it. Commercial gum products contain roughly the same list of toxic ingredients, with differing labeling, which is virtually always designed to mislead.

Common Ingredients of Gum

After looking at several different brands of chewing gum, we found that these were the most common ingredients:

– Sorbitol

– Gum base

– Aspartame

– Acacia

– Acesulfame Potassium

– Xylitol

– Artificial and Natural Flavoring

– Sodium Stearate

– Calcium Casein Peptone-Calcium Phosphate

– Titanium Dioxide

– BHT

– Candelilla Wax

– Mannitol

– Maltitol

The “Sugar-Free” Sugar AlcoholsTitanium dioxide is so cancerous that external skin contact is enough to cause cancer. Be reminded that all of these ingredients absorb directly into the bloodstream through the walls of the mouth. Some of these ingredients are explained in-depth, because it is prudent to correct the myth that chewing gum is harmless and even good for you (e.g. “it strengthens the teeth”).

Sorbitol, maltitol, and mannitol are sugar alcohols. These are usually made from sugar, and they frequently increase the blood sugar just as much as eating sugar. However, manufacturers make deceptive “sugar-free” claims about sugar alcohols, since these ingredients are not pure sugar anymore. While such sugar derivatives are technically “sugar free” when the manipulative word games are employed, they nonetheless remain dangerous for diabetics, who are the very audience that these gums are marketed to.

Let us not forget that the sugar alcohol containing gums are also marketed to improve our dental health. The sugar alcohols are even more chemically processed than white sugar is; and thus much more foreign to the body by virtue of its artificial nature, so we have reason to believe that these forms of chemical industry sugars will stimulate even more weight gain and inflammation than regular sugar. All of the evidence points in this direction.

These chemically-extracted sugar alcohols are documented to cause abdominal pains and diarrhea, whilst aggravating various health conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome. Therefore, the immune system takes a huge hit from exposure to them. This immune suppression will in turn cause greater yeast development in the body, which will lead to cavities and allergies.

Gum Base

Instead of telling customers what they are really chewing, the phrase “gum base” is used to generalize a list of ingredients that is never actually published. As the name implies, it is the foundation agent of chewing gum. We have tried exhaustively to find exactly what modern “gum base” is made from. We found the following babble repeatedly regurgitated by all of the major gum companies. It was obviously meant to derail serious research:

“Gum base is produced through a blend of raw materials which can be categorized in five classes:

1. Elastomers, act as the key ingredient and provide elasticity

2. Resins act as binders and softeners

3. Plasticizers render the elastomer soft to ensure thorough blending of the gum base

4. Fillers contribute to the overall texture

5. Antioxidants prevent oxidation of the gum base and flavors during shelf life”

Since this was repeated identically at all websites that we looked at, we can only assume that all of these companies are actually owned by the same people, or at least they are working together as a cartel to cover-up an honest disclosure of what is in gum. We eventually confirmed that the ingredients of gum base are commercial trade secrets. None of the websites told us the full ingredients. For instance, exactly what plasticizer is used? Are people chewing on super-toxic PVC? The plasticizing agents could contain dioxins, and quite frankly, they probably do.

After much more research, we found one Chinese company who told us about their ingredients.Wuxi Yueda Gum Base Manufacture Co, Ltd said:

“It is made of several food grade raw materials, which are rubber (food grade), glycerol ester of rosin, paraffin waxes, polyvinyl acetates, talc powder and calcium carbonate.”

Glycerol ester of rosin is often made from the stumps of pine trees. It is used industrially to create fast-drying varnishes. The Internet is riddled with stories of people who had severe allergic reactions to it, usually causing a swollen throat that led to difficulty breathing. Glycerol ester of rosin is now being added to soft drinks, though federal limits ensure that its quantity remains under 100 P.P.M. This safety limitation does not apply to chewing gum.

Talc has been linked to lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and fibrotic pneumoconiosis with just transdermal exposure. It is very rarely put into products that are to be consumed. The only other consumable products that we have seen containing talc are diet aids (most are extremely toxic). Talcum powder was once used on small children, but it has now been replaced with cornstarch, due to safety concerns. It is too dangerous to touch the skin, but absorbing it straight into the bloodstream is apparently acceptable.

Polyvinyl acetate is not quite PVC. It is PVA. PVA is frequently referred to as “Carpenter’s glue” or simply “white glue”. Remember that this is not being used as an industrial product, but as something that children are frequently given to chew on (gum base is in bubble gum too). This ingredient compliments the paraffin wax, which is derived from refined petroleum.

Aspartame is one of the most controversial additives of all time, and sits alongside MSG and saccharin in terms of both consumer distrust and poor safety. Its presence in foods has nothing to do with safety, but everything to do with politics and money. Aspartame has been linked to just about every health condition known, from seizures to brain tumors. Some epileptic patients have recovered from their condition simply by eliminating this toxin from their diets. It is found in diet foods, diet drinks, and sugar-free products as an alternative to sugar. Aspartame is a solution that remains worse than the problem.

Aspartame is an excitotoxin, which means that it over-excites the neurons in the brain, until they burn out, causing lowered intelligence and a host of neurological problems. Aspartame causes diabetes, fibromyalgia, lowered I.Q., obesity, multiple sclerosis,asthma, insomnia, muscle spasms, and a total of 92 known symptoms.

Acesulfame potassium (acesulfame K) has similar properties to aspartame, and it is believed to be a carcinogen. The Center for Science in the Public Interest petitioned the F.D.A. for a stay of approval, due to the lack of testing done on this substance. Studies on animals have shown a correlation between acesulfame potassium and various tumors.

While we would love to be able to provide information about calcium casein peptone (calcium phosphate), we cannot. We simply do not know. Its only appearance is in Trident gum (the worst brand), and we were unable to find studies or any other information about it. It might be a whitening agent. It is important to note that casein is a milk extract that was linked with the Chinese baby formula poisonings. Trust this ingredient at your own risk, but we would never encourage the use of something that has its research censored from the public. That tends to be a bad sign.

BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene) is a preservative that has been linked to cancer. It was banned in the United Kingdom and Japan. It is unbelievably sold as a “dietary supplement”, and some people believe that it has anti-viral effects. So do gasoline and rat poison. We do not recommend it, because of the safety implications. It causes kidney and liver damage. Benjamin Feingold (creator of the Feingold Diet) linked it to hyperactivity in children in the 1970’s, as a large component of A.D.H.D.

For the sake of brevity, we shall discontinue examining the ingredients in chewing gum. Chewing gum is easily one of the most toxic products available, and it is difficult to ever know exactly what it contains due to vague terms such as “gum base” and “artificial flavors”. These reflect trade secrets, and the ingredients probably are made of hundreds of other ingredients that they are unwilling to disclose. Manufacturers maintain that customers have no right to know.

Natural gum is available, which is made from chicle, a tree that is native to Central America. There was a time when all chewing gum was made from it, but using it incurs more manufacturing expense. Natural gum can be purchased online or from health food stores.

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

By Trace Mayer / GoldSeek

I just got back from a two week vacation without Internet as I was scouring some archeological ruins. I hardly thought about Bitcoin at all because there were so many other interesting things and it would be there when I got back.

Jimmy Song suggested I do an article on the current state of Bitcoin. A great suggestion but he is really smart (he worked on Armory after all!) so I better be thorough and accurate!

Therefore, this article will be pretty lengthy and meticulous.

BACKGROUND

As I completely expected, the 2X movement from the New York Agreement that was supposed to happen during the middle of my vacation flopped on its face because Jeff Garzik was driving the clown car with passengers willfully inside like Coinbase, Blockchain.info, Bitgo and Xapo and there were massive bugS and here in the code and miners like Bitmain did not want to allocate $150-350m to get it over the difficulty adjustments.

I am very disappointed in their lack of integrity with putting their money where their mouths are; myself and many others wanted to sell a lot of B2X for BTC!

On 7 December 2015, with Bitcoin trading at US$388.40, I wrote The Rise of the Fourth Great Bitcoin Bubble. On 4 December 2016, with Bitcoin trading at US$762.97, I did this interview:

As of 26 November 2017, Bitcoin is trading around US$9,250.00. That is an increase of about 2,400% since I wrote the article prognosticating this fourth great Bitcoin bull market. I sure like being right, like usual (19 Dec 2011, 1 Jul 2013), especially when there are financial and economic consequences.

With such massive gains in such a short period of time the speculative question becomes: Buy, Hold or Sell?

FUNDAMENTALS

Bitcoin is the decentralized censorship-resistant Internet Protocol for transferring value over a communications channel.

The Bitcoin network can use traditional Internet infrastructure. However, it is even more resilient because it has custom infrastructure including, thanks to Bitcoin Core developer Matt Corrallo, the FIBRE network and, thanks to Blockstream, satellites which reduce the cost of running a full-node anywhere in the world to essentially nothing in terms of money or privacy. Transactions can be cheaply broadcast via SMS messages.

SECURITY

The Bitcoin network has a difficulty of 1,347,001,430,559 which suggests about 9,642,211 TH/s of custom ASIC hardware deployed.

At a retail price of approximately US$105/THs that implies about $650m of custom ASIC hardware deployed (35% discount applied).

This custom hardware consumes approximately 30 TWh per year. That could power about 2.8m US households or the entire country of Morocco which has a population of 33.85m.

This Bitcoin mining generates approximately 12.5 bitcoins every 10 minutes or approximately 1,800 per day worth approximately US$16,650,000.

Bitcoin currently has a market capitalization greater than $150B which puts it solidly in the top-30 of M1 money stock countries and a 200 day moving average of about $65B which is increasing about $500m per day.

Average daily volumes for Bitcoin is around US$5B. That means multi-million dollar positions can be moved into and out of very easily with minimal slippage.

When my friend Andreas Antonopolous was unable to give his talk at a CRYPSA event I was invited to fill in and delivered this presentation, impromptu, on the Seven Network Effects of Bitcoin.

These seven network effects of Bitcoin are (1) Speculation, (2) Merchants, (3) Consumers, (4) Security [miners], (5) Developers, (6) Financialization and (7) Settlement Currency are all taking root at the same time and in an incredibly intertwined way.

With only the first network effect starting to take significant root; Bitcoin is no longer a little experiment of magic Internet money anymore. Bitcoin is monster growing at a tremendous rate!!

SPECULATION

For the Bitcoin price to remain at $9,250 it requires approximately US$16,650,000 per day of capital inflow from new hodlers.

Bitcoin is both a Giffen good and a Veblen good.

A Giffen good is a product that people consume more of as the price rises and vice versa — seemingly in violation of basic laws of demand in microeconomics such as with substitute goods and the income effect.

Veblen goods are types of luxury goods for which the quantity demanded increases as the price increases in an apparent contradiction of the law of demand.

There are approximately 16.5m bitcoins of which ~4m are lost, ~4-6m are in deep cold storage, ~4m are in cold storage and ~2-4m are salable.

And forks like BCash (BCH) should not be scary but instead be looked upon as an opportunity to take more territory on the Bitcoin blockchain by trading the forks for real bitcoins which dries up more salable supply by moving it, likely, into deep cold storage.

According to Wikipedia, there are approximately 15.4m millionaires in the United States and about 12m HNWIs ($30m+ net worth) in the world. In other words, if every HNWI in the world wanted to own an entire bitcoin as a ‘risk-free asset’ that cannot be confiscated, seized or have the balance other wise altered then they could not.

For wise portfolio management, these HNWIs should have at least about 2-5% in gold and 0.5-1% in bitcoin.

Why? Perhaps some of the 60+ Saudis with 1,700 frozen bank accounts and about $800B of assets being targetted might be able to explain it to you.

In other words, everyone loves to chase the rabbit and once they catch it then know that it will not get away.

RETAIL

There are approximately 150+ significant Bitcoin exchanges worldwide. Kraken, according to the CEO, was adding about 6,000 new funded accounts per day in July 2017.

Supposedly, Coinbase is currently adding about 75,000 new accounts per day. Based on some trade secret analytics I have access to; I would estimate Coinbase is adding approximately 17,500 new accounts per day that purchase at least US$100 of Bitcoin.

If we assume Coinbase accounts for 8% of new global Bitcoin users who purchase at least $100 of bitcoins (just pulled out of thin error and likely very conservative as the actual number is perhaps around 2%) then that is approximately $21,875,000 of new capital coming into Bitcoin every single day just from retail demand.

What I have found is that most new users start off buying US$100-500 and then after 3-4 months months they ramp up their capital allocation to $5,000+ if they have the funds available.

After all, it takes some time and practical experience to learn how to safely secure one’s private keys.

To do so, I highly recommend Bitcoin Core (network consensus and full validation of the blockchain), Armory (private key management), Glacier Protocol (operational procedures) and aPuri.sm laptop (secure non-specialized hardware).

WALL STREET

There has been no solution for large financial fiduciaries to invest in Bitcoin. This changed November 2017.

LedgerX, whose CEO I interviewed 23 March 2013, began trading as a CFTC regulated Swap Execution Facility and Derivatives Clearing Organization.

The CME Group announced they will begin trading in Q4 2017 Bitcoin futures.

The CBOE announced they will begin trading Bitcoin futures soon.

By analogy, these institutional products are like connecting a major metropolis’s water system (US$90.4T and US$2 quadrillion) via a nanoscopic shunt to a tiny blueberry ($150B) that is infinitely expandable.

This price discovery could be the most wild thing anyone has ever experienced in financial markets.

THE GREAT CREDIT CONTRACTION

The same week Bitcoin was released I published my book The Great Credit Contraction and asserted it had now begun and capital would burrow down the liquidity pyramid into safer and more liquid assets.

Thus, the critical question becomes: Is Bitcoin a possible solution to the Great Credit Contraction by becoming the safest and most liquid asset?

BITCOIN’S RISK PROFILE

At all times and in all circumstances gold remains money but, of course, there is alwaysexchange rate risk due to price ratios constantly fluctuating. If the metal is held with a third-party in allocated-allocated storage (safest possible) then there is performance risk (Morgan Stanley gold storage lawsuit).

But, if properly held then, there should be no counter-party risk which requires the financial ability of a third-party to perform like with a bank account deposit. And, since gold exists at a single point in space and time therefore it is subject to confiscation or seizure risk.

Bitcoin is a completely new asset type. As such, the storage container is nearly empty with only $150B.

And every Bitcoin transaction effectively melts down every BTC and recasts it; thus ensuring with 100% accuracy the quantity and quality of the bitcoins. If the transaction is not on the blockchain then it did not happen. This is the strictest regulation possible; by math and cryptography!

This new immutable asset, if properly secured, is subject only to exchange rate risk. There does exist the possibility that a software bug may exist that could shut down the network, like what has happened with Ethereum, but the probability is almost nil and getting lower everyday it does not happen.

Thus, Bitcoin arguably has a lower risk profile than even gold and is the only blockchain to achieve security, scalability and liquidity.

To remain decentralized, censorship-resistant and immutable requires scalability so as many users as possible can run full-nodes.

TRANSACTIONS

Some people, probably mostly those shilling alt-coins, think Bitcoin has a scalability problem that is so serious it requires a crude hard fork to solve.

On the other side of the debate, the Internet protocol and blockchain geniuses assert the scalability issues can, like other Internet Protocols have done, be solved in different layers which are now possible because of Segregated Witness which was activated in August 2017.

Whose code do you want to run: the JV benchwarmers or the championship Chicago Bulls?

As transaction fees rise, certain use cases of the Bitcoin blockchain are priced out of the market. And as the fees fall then they are economical again.

Additionally, as transaction fees rise, certain UTXOs are no longer economically usable thus destroying part of the money supply until fees decline and UTXOs become economical to move.

There are approximately 275,000-350,000 transactions per day with transaction fees currently about $2m/day and the 200 DMA is around $1.08m/day.

What I like about transaction fees is that they somewhat reveal the financial health of the network.

The security of the Bitcoin network results from the miners creating solutions to proof of work problems in the Bitcoin protocol and being rewarded from the (1) coinbase reward which is a form of inflation and (2) transaction fees which is a form of usage fee.

The higher the transaction fees then the greater implied value the Bitcoin network provides because users are willing to pay more for it.

I am highly skeptical of blockchains which have very low transaction fees. By Internet bubble analogy, Pets.com may have millions of page views but I am more interested in EBITDA.

DEVELOPERS

Bitcoin and blockchain programming is not an easy skill to acquire and master. Most developers who have the skill are also financially independent now and can work on whatever they want.

The best of the best work through the Bitcoin Core process. After all, if you are a world class mountain climber then you do not hang out in the MacDonalds play pen but instead climb Mount Everest because that is where the challenge is.

However, there are many talented developers who work in other areas besides the protocol. Wallet maintainers, exchange operators, payment processors, etc. all need competent developers to help build their businesses.

Consequently, there is a huge shortage of competent developers. This is probably the largest single scalability constraint for the ecosystem.

Nevertheless, the Bitcoin ecosystem is healthier than ever before.

SETTLEMENT CURRENCY

There are no significant global reserve settlement currency use cases for Bitcoin yet.

Perhaps the closest is Blockstream’s Strong Federations via Liquid.

PRICE

There is a tremendous amount of disagreement in the marketplace about the value proposition of Bitcoin. Price discovery for this asset will be intense and likely take many cycles of which this is the fourth.

Since the supply is known the exchange rate of Bitcoins is composed of (1) transactional demand and (2) speculative demand.

On 4 May 2017, Lightspeed Venture Partners partner Jeremy Liew who was among the early Facebook investors and the first Snapchat investor laid out their case for bitcoin exploding to $500,000 by 2030.

On 2 November 2017, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein said, “Now we have paper that is just backed by fiat…Maybe in the new world, something gets backed by consensus.”

On 12 Sep 2017, JP Morgan CEO called Bitcoin a ‘fraud’ but conceded that “Bitcoin could reach $100,000“.

Thus, it is no surprise that the Bitcoin chart looks like a ferret on meth when there are such widely varying opinions on its value proposition.

I have been around this space for a long time. In my opinion, those who scoffed at the thought of $1 BTC, $10 BTC (Professor Bitcorn!), $100 BTC, $1,000 BTC are scoffing at $10,000 BTC and will scoff at $100,000 BTC, $1,000,000 BTC and even $10,000,000 BTC.

Interestingly, the people who understand it the best seem to think its financial dominance is destiny.

Meanwhile, those who understand it the least make emotionally charged, intellectually incoherent bearish arguments. A tremendous example of worldwide cognitive dissonance with regards to sound money, technology and the role or power of the State.

Consequently, I like looking at the 200 day moving average to filter out the daily noise and see the long-term trend.

Well, that chart of the long-term trend is pretty obvious and hard to dispute. Bitcoin is in a massive secular bull market.

The 200 day moving average is around $4,001 and rising about $30 per day.

So, what do some proforma situations look like where Bitcoin may be undervalued, average valued and overvalued? No, these are not prognostications.

Maybe Jamie Dimon is not so off his rocker after all with a $100,000 price prediction.

We are in a very unique period of human history where the collective globe is rethinking what money is and Bitcoin is in the ring battling for complete domination. Is or will it be fit for purpose?

As I have said many times before, if Bitcoin is fit for this purpose then this is the largest wealth transfer in the history of the world.

CONCLUSION

Well, this has been a brief analysis of where I think Bitcoin is at the end of November 2017.

The seven network effects are taking root extremely fast and exponentially reinforcing each other. The technological dominance of Bitcoin is unrivaled.

The world is rethinking what money is. Even CEOs of the largest banks and partners of the largest VC funds are honing in on Bitcoin’s beacon.

While no one has a crystal ball; when I look in mine I see Bitcoin’s future being very bright.

Currently, almost everyone who has bought Bitcoin and hodled is sitting on unrealized gains as measured in fiat currency. That is, after all, what uncharted territory with daily all-time highs do!

But perhaps there is a larger lesson to be learned here.

Riches are getting increasingly slippery because no one has a reliable defined tool to measure them with. Times like these require incredible amounts of humility and intelligence guided by macro instincts.

Perhaps everyone should start keeping books in three numéraires: USD, gold and Bitcoin.

Both gold and Bitcoin have never been worth nothing. But USD is a fiat currency and there are thousands of those in the fiat currency graveyard. How low can the world reserve currency go?

After all, what is the risk-free asset? And, whatever it is, in The Great Credit Contraction you want it!

What do you think? Disagree with some of my arguments or assertions? Please, eviscerate them on Twitter!

1141,1304,BreakPoint: A Healthy Dose of Religious Freedom,"For healthcare providers facing restrictions on their rights of conscience, reinforcements are on the way.

On January 18th, the Trump Administration announced the creation of the Conscience and Religious Freedom Division of Health and Human Services.

According to Roger Severino, the head of the Civil Rights Office at HHS, the division’s purpose is to protect doctors, nurses, and other health care providers “from being coerced into participating in activities that violate their consciences, such as abortion, sterilization, or assisted suicide.”

This is very good news. Not only does it further the cause of religious freedom, but it recognizes that religious freedom is more than just the right to believe what we want in the privacy of our heads, homes and houses of worship. Instead it’s the right to orient our lives, including our public lives, around those beliefs. And it also shines a much-needed light on what is a frontline in the battle to protect freedom of conscience and religion: hospitals and doctors’ offices.

As Severino put it, “America’s doctors and nurses are dedicated to saving lives and should not be bullied out of the practice of medicine simply because they object to performing abortions against their conscience . . .”

Last week, his office released a 216-page proposed regulation entitled “Protecting Statutory Conscience Rights in Health Care.”

Now predictably, critics jumped on the announcement. Lambda Legal said that the Division and the proposed rule “[weaponizes] HHS’s Office of Civil Rights against [the LGBT community].”

If you’re wondering what on earth they’re talking about, you’re not alone. Somehow, a proposal about abortion and physician-assisted suicide is actually about the LGBT community?

The proposed rule mentions “abortion” 155 times and “suicide” 29 times. We know because we counted. Now how many time does it use “LGBT,” or “transgender,” or any related term? Zero.

Someone whose response to the announcement made sense was the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. They expressed gratitude to HHS for “taking seriously its charge to protect these fundamental civil rights.” “For too long,” they said, “we have seen medical professionals, including pro-life nurses like Cathy DeCarlo, who have been coerced by their employers into participating in abortion.” DeCarlo, a nurse at New York’s Mt. Sinai Hospital, was threatened with disciplinary action “in May 2009 if she did not honor a last-minute summons to assist in a scheduled late-term abortion.”

This was despite the fact that, one, DeCarlo’s objection to abortion was on record, and two, there was no medical emergency involved. The Alliance Defending Freedom, representing DeCarlo, asked HHS to investigate, and it did. The result was a change in the policy at the hospital. Unfortunately, by then the damage to DeCarlo’s religious freedom had already been done.

There are more than 600 Catholic hospitals in the United States, which provide one in six of the nation’s hospital beds. Many view this as a terrible thing precisely because these institutions, not to mention the Protestant ones, will not go along with John Paul II called “the culture of death.”

The Manhattan Declaration specifically cited “the effort to compel pro-life institutions (including religiously affiliated hospitals and clinics), and pro-life physicians, surgeons, nurses, and other health care professionals, to refer for abortions and, in certain cases, even to perform or participate in abortions.”

If people can be compelled to participate in the taking of innocent human life, there’s no limit to what can be done to violate the conscience.

I’m grateful for the Administration’s and Severino’s commitment to protecting this religious freedom of health care workers. In doing so, they’ve taken an important step in protecting ours, as well.

He reveals the secret settlements they built as they moved westward across the vast wilderness of North America, evading the European church and royal houses. He explains how the Templars found refuge in the sacred medicine lodges of the Algonquins, whose ceremonies bear striking resemblance to initiations of Freemasonry. Explores how Sinclair built sacred monuments, including the Newport Tower.

9845,11107,Chuck Schumer to GOP: Expect a 'reckoning next November',"Republicans may have passed a sweeping tax bill, but Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is bullish about Democrats' prospects in 2018.

Schumer says the unpopularity of Republicans' once-in-a-generation tax overhaul, which he said tilts heavily toward corporations, isn’t going away.

“The only major thing they can point to is the tax bill and even on that bill the public doesn’t like it,” the New York Democrat said. “I believe it will be an anchor around the ankles of every Republican who voted for it.”

Schumer said Republicans should be worried, and pointed to Democrats' election victories in Virginia, New Jersey, and Alabama.

“The political problems they’re having now are only going to get worse,” Schumer said. “People are standing up and rejecting the Republican agenda across the country including in states that have been ruby red for years.”

“We’re seeing an incredible swing away from Republicans and toward the Democrats from one end of the country to the other,” he added. “If Republicans continue to hurt the middle class, if they continue to kowtow to the powerful corporations and the wealthy, then they’re in for a reckoning next November.”

Democrats' historic upset in Alabama improved their chances of flipping control of the Senate, but the math is still tricky. Ten of the Senate Democrats up for re-election next cycle are in states Trump won. They will have to hold all of them and win two Republican-held seats. Some of their best pickup options are in Arizona and Nevada.

The House landscape is much more favorable. Democrats are plus-13 on a generic ballot for 2018, according to RealClearPolitics. CNN put Democrats up 18 points on a generic ballot. They only need to be up roughly eight points to have a shot at capturing the House. Still, November is 11 months away.

Asked if Democrats would try to repeal the GOP tax overhaul if they gained control, Schumer said an overhaul was likely.

“There are probably a small number of provisions we might not repeal but it certainly would need drastic overhaul, aiming it at the middle class and not the wealthy and powerful,” Schumer said.

Pressed on what parts Democrats like, Schumer said “very few.”

“I would just say this even the parts we like aren’t good enough — child tax credit, measly,” he said. “We proposed a bigger one. We wouldn’t repeal what they did; we’d try to make it better.”",http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/chuck-schumer-to-gop-expect-a-reckoning-next-november/article/2644164,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

Goodbye Ritz Carlton. Saudi Arabia’s billionaire prince Alwaleed Bin Talal, has been carted off to Al Ha’ir prison, south of Riyadh, after refusing to pay a reported $6 billion to Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman to secure his freedom, following a massive consolidation of power on November 4, 2017 in which over 300 princes, ministers and other elites were rounded up in an “anti-corruption” purge.

Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal

Sources told the Middle East Montior that nearly 60 detainees were transferred to the most high security prison in the Kingdom. The prisoners include Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal as Prince Turki Bin Abdullah and a number of government officials who refused to make the large financial payments for their release.

Al’hair prison

Among those arrested on allegations of corruption is Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal, the Saudi King’s nephew who is worth more than $17bn according to Forbes, and owns stakes in Twitter, Lyft and Citigroup. According to a Daily Mail source, the crown prince had lulled Alwaleed into a false sense of security, inviting him to a meeting at his Al Yamamah palace, then sent officers to arrest him the night before the meeting.

‘Suddenly at 2.45am all his guards were disarmed, the royal guards of MBS storm in,’ said the source. ‘He’s dragged from his own bedroom in his pajamas, handcuffed, put in the back of an SUV, and interrogated like a criminal. ‘They hung them upside down, just to send a message.

Purged princes and the like were taken to the Riydah Ritz Carlton Hotel, where they have reportedly been allowed to buy their freedom by giving up their billions in oil wealth for their lives.



Purged Royals inside Riydah Ritz Carlton

As the Daily Mail reported in November, mercenaries purportedly employed by Academi – a successor to infamous US security contractor Blackwater, have been stringing up some of MBS’s “guests” at the Riyadh Ritz Carlton by their feet and savagely beating them during interrogations. The claims have spread rapidly on Arabic-language social media, and even Lebanon’s president Michel Aoun has accused MbS of using mercenaries.

Meanwhile, none of Prince Alwaleed’s powerful friends appear to be coming to his defense. As CNBC points out:

One of the most stunning aspects of bin Talal’s detention is how quiet his long list of influential friends have been about it. This week brought at least some mention of his plight with a statement from two former French presidents who expressed concern over Alwaleed’s status. But let’s face it: a few words from a couple of French ex-presidents is peanuts. So now we have bin Alwaleed in an actual prison, with a government aggressively taking cash and assets, and still no significant outcry from his foreign friends.

Bin Salman came to power last summer after King Salman changed the order of succession and made Bin Salman crown prince. In addition to his “anti-corruption” puge to consolidate power and wealth, the country has embarked on an ambitious plan called “Vision 2030“- which aims to modernize Saudi Arabia and break its dependence on oil production, as well as combat human rights violations.

In late September, Saudi Arabia took the unprecedented step of allowing women to drive. “The royal decree will implement the provisions of traffic regulations, including the issuance of driving licenses for men and women alike,” the Saudi Press Agency said, according to Al Aribaya

Meanwhile, A Saudi Government panel has asked that all marriage contracts for girls under the age of 18 be approved by family courts – the latest step in a series of sweeping reforms under the lead of their new Crown Prince, Mohammad bin Salman. While falling short of outlawing child marriage, the request marks the first major legislation involving the long-standing practice primarily overseen by Saudi clerics and local judges – not family courts.

The proposed legislation was part of a series of recommendations by the Committee of Islamic and Judiciary Affairs last Monday, which also called for “competent” family courts to oversee premarital virginity tests for girls under 18.

“The committee acceded to have those under 18 submit their marriage contracts, as well as a pre-marital tests to a competent court to determine their case” –Councilwoman Dr. Eqbal Darandari

“Some Shoura members disagreed with this decision because they believed it meant we condone underage marriage,” said Darandari, adding “Others suggested that only those between the ages of 16-18 can transfer their cases to a judge, and those below 16 cannot get married. Some members demanded this be applied to underage boys, as well.”

Dr. Darandari is among several Saudi legislators who believe in an an age limit for underage girls’ to marry. “Girls’ voices must be heard and their opinions taken into consideration. I don’t believe a pre-marital test is enough. In my opinion, I think we need a female committee — made of a doctor, lawyer, psychologist and social worker — that studies the girl’s state in order to assess whether or not she can get married.”

She also warned of the damage which can occur to children who are forced into marriage.

“Those that are fifteen or younger can undergo severe physical and psychological damage through marriage, and they’re probably unequipped for it. I believe there should be sanctions to those who do not adhere to that, and in the case of a marriage during that delicate age, a girl’s right to demand a divorce if things don’t work out should be guaranteed.” –Dr. Eqbal Darandari

So there you have it – Bin Salman is attempting to modernize his country, while wrestling power from long-standing oil families. And for those who don’t comply, it’s off to prison where the beatings shall continue until morale improves.

Today a premium is placed on being sensitive, understanding, and tolerant. For those of us in the know, we recognize this malady as political correctness. This disease of PC softens truth with the goal of changing it, or at least rendering truth ineffective. Softened words are used to protect the feelings of individuals. Words such as “stupid” are looked down upon with disdain, yet what better word could be used to describe the ones who have created the sorry mess in government that filters down into every day life?

The fourth circuit court of appeals ruled recently that the name Jesus could only be spoken once or twice in legislative prayers. The US Supreme Court was petitioned to hear the case for a reverse ruling, but on January 17, 2012, they have officially refused to hear the case, which means the lower court ruling stands and is now law in the five states of the fourth circuit district. To state it plainly, a court can now determine the content of an individual’s prayer to God. Whatever happened to that separation of church and state thing when you really need it?

5666,6479,He Visited All 201 Countries In The World… WITHOUT Using A Plane,"Source: www.endoriot.com | Original Post Date: January 25, 2014 –

Graham Hughes, a 33-year-old adventurer from Liverpool, England, has become the first person to visit all 201 countries in the world – WITHOUT using a plane.

Hughes used buses, taxis, trains and his own two feet to travel 160,000 miles in exactly 1,426 days – all on a shoestring of just $100 a week. And it was no easy task.

He spent four days “crossing open ocean in a leaky boat” to reach Cape Verde.

He was jailed for a week in the Congo for being a “spy.” He was arrested trying to “sneak into” Russia and had to be “rescued from Muslim fundamentalists by a Filipino transsexual named Jenn.”

“I love travel, and I guess my reason for doing it was I wanted to see if this could be done, by one person traveling on a shoestring,” he told the Christian Science Monitor. “I think I also wanted to show that the world is not some big, scary place, but in fact is full of people who want to help you even if you are a stranger.”

He has traversed the borders of all 193 members of the United Nations plus Taiwan, Vatican City, Palestine, Kosovo, Western Sahara and the four home nations of The United Kingdom – all without flying.

Guinness World Records has now confirmed that Hughes, who filmed the expedition for a documentary and raised money for charity WaterAid, has achieved the world record for the “Most countries visited in one year by scheduled ground transport”.

While all land transport had to have either wheels, hooves or sturdy rubber soles, he made the longer-haul voyages mostly by hitching lifts on cargo ships.

He even managed to get a lift on a friendly cruise ship to the Dominican Republic.

Other highlights include dancing with the Highlanders of Papua New Guinea, befriending orangutans in Borneo, riding through the badlands of Kenya on an 18-wheel truck, meeting the Prime Minister of Tuvalu – and “warning schoolchildren in Afghanistan about the dangers of men with beards”.

He says people tend to wonder how he got into the further-out countries like North Korea, Iraq and Afghanistan, but he says they were the easy ones.

Far tougher was negotiating routes into tiny island nations like Nauru, in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, the Maldives and the Seychelles “where there were sometimes pirate threats”.

He says there were low points on the trip such as “sitting in a bus station in Cambodia at one in the morning or riding some awful truck over bad roads” when he thought: “Why am I doing this?”

The lowest point came when his sister, Nicole, died of cancer at just 39 years old. He broke the trip to hurry home to see her.

“I’d done 184 countries and had only 17 to go and I thought why not leave it there? (…but) she told me not to stop,” he added.

Now having finished his journey, he has no intention of buying a plane ticket any time soon and says he plans to “keep in the spirit of the adventure.”

Here is the list of countries visited in order:

2692,3069,"Uh-oh, American church: Here comes Gen Z – Baptist News Global","Congregational and worship consultants are practically guaranteed job security in the coming decades thanks to the coming of Generation Z, aka Gen Z.

Experts anticipate that churches which have long used coaches, books and seminars just to tread water with Millennials will be even more challenged by that up-and-coming group whose older members are just reaching college age.

And while still young — they were born from about 2000 and 2015 — consultants and demographers who track membership, faith and worship trends are alerting clients to the coming impacts Gen Z.

One wake-up call is coming from the polling firm Barna, which teamed up this year with a national teen and college-age ministry to study Gen Z. They are set to announce the results of their study in January 2018.

“America has been wringing its hands over Millennials for a while now,” Barna editor in chief Roxanne Stone said in an announcement of the release.

There are so many questions about the generation.

“Who are they?” Stone asked. “Will they carry on the Millennial trends we’ve been studying for decades? How are they different? What is their relationship to faith, to parents, to institutions? How has culture and society shaped them?”

One thing for certain about Gen Z is the complexity of the different age groups within it, says George Bullard, director of missions for the Columbia-Metro Baptist Association in South Carolina and a long-time church consultant.

The first group, or phase, of the generation became increasingly savvy with technology as it developed, he said. However, technology was more fully entrenched and available to those born closer to 2015.

Bullard said he has seen this with three grandchildren who are members of the generation.

“The oldest was born in the early 2000s and adapted to new technology as it came along,” he said. “The youngest has never known anything but an iPad. And none of the three watch television anymore — it’s all on their iPads and phones.”

That means there will be no easy technological fix for churches wishing to accommodate Gen Z.

The generation has already had an impact on churches. Bullard said he’s heard of churches abandoning the traditional three-year cycle in youth ministry in favor of 18-month cycles to keep with the pace of generational change.

Congregations can also be expected to be challenged by the openness most members of the generation share toward racial, gender and same-sex diversity.

And this up-and-coming generation will be hard to stereotype.

“They are complicated,” he said. “There will be multiple themes and it won’t be as simple to define them as it was when we first started with Boomers.”

But encountering Gen Z doesn’t have to be any more stressful or chaotic than it was for churches attempting to reach Millennials, says Mark Tidsworth, founder and president of Pinnacle Leadership Associates and author of Shift: Three Big Moves for the 21st Century Church.

Then as now, he said, it’s important that congregations remember, and remain faithful to, their core values and mission.

“We should want to be true to our identity and not change with everything new that comes along.”

Besides, change is inevitable — just has it has been throughout the history of the church.

“The kernel of truth helpful for churches is that demographics are always changing and generations are always changing,” Tidsworth says. “The key is to be as adaptive as we can but not let it overwhelm or overload us.”",https://baptistnews.com/article/uh-oh-american-church-comes-gen-z/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

A ground-breaking way to fund international space projects, which makes space exploration available to the public, is launching today (January 24) during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

A community-led crowdfunding platform run by Spacebit, under the watchful eye of a team of consultants, astronauts, engineers and rocket scientists, will enable the public to vote on large scale space exploration projects.

The Spacebit Foundation has been developing and building an ecosystem to allow people and small enterprise to take advantage of recent giant leaps in launch technology and satellite platforms for five years, and has already gained support from top scientists, industry leaders and public figures.

Today marks the launch of a new platform, on which the public can participate and financially support future space missions.

Spacebit has strong, existing financial backing from venture capital. From now on and for the first time, individuals can fully and financially participate in the project, becoming part of this new space community. Once launch costs are met, Spacebit will begin the next exciting stage of its vision: The first publicly crypto-funded space mission.

Pavlo Tanasyuk, founder of Spacebit explains: “The future of space exploration is currently reliant on Governments and commercial investors. However, with available public money for space exploration on an inevitable decline, we believe that individuals and private stakeholders will become the new space pioneers, and blockchain technology can make it happen. We believe that technologies like blockchain and a new kind of crowdfunding, using cryptocurrency, is the future of space exploration.”

“Our ultimate goal is a mission to the Moon, but first we aim to launch a satellite within the next year. Launching a satellite will prove that community funded missions are viable and will ensure that the future of space exploration can be privately funded. Once the doors to space are open – the possibilities are endless. But you have to get involved, to find out more about our funding community and be a part of open space exploration.”

Spacebit will propose several missions to its community of participants. The missions to the Moon are currently being developed and will include a lunar drone mission to explore the volcanic caves and to put a radio telescope on the back side of the moon using a rover and utilising a lunar orbiting satellite to relay the data back to Earth.

Apollo 15 Lunar Command Module Pilot, Col. Al Worden commented on Spacebit’s plans to put telescope on the Moon: “Since my flight in 1971, I’ve commented many times, that the back side of moon would be a perfect place to put a telescope, in order to observe more of our universe.”

Spacebit is a unique space company with offices across the globe. Spacebit is changing the way large space projects and missions are funded. Its ultimate goal is to democratise space exploration, unshackled by state or national sponsorship, which allows everyone to participate in the future of humanity in our universe.

For more information or to join the Spacebit community visit, www.spacebit.com.

Founders of Spacebit are in Davos for the launch which takes place at 22.00 on January 24 at the Hub Culture Pavilion, Promenade 93, 7270 Davos Platz, Switzerland. Interviews and a Q&A sheet are available on request.

“L’Oréal Paris UK are both proud and excited to be launching such a unique and disruptive campaign for the haircare market, a category which in previous years has been perceived as the cliché of beauty advertising,” she said.

Democrats downplay memo ahead of release

A classified memo purporting to show the Obama Justice Department illegally spied on the Trump campaign is nothing but a conspiracy theory, according to a top Democrat representative.

In a letter addressed to the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Tuesday, Rep. Jerry Nadler said the “so-called ‘Nunes Memo’” has been distorted by Republicans to their political advantage and distracts from the special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

“It is a profoundly misleading document. The House Committee on the Judiciary must act without delay to correct the record – and in your words – to permit Special Counsel Mueller to complete his investigation ‘without interference,’” Nadler says.

Asking for a copy of the memo to be made available to the committee, Nadler tells House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte that the four-page memo is being misrepresented and that Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes has concocted a “conspiracy theory.”

“You and I have had the opportunity to review many of the documents that the intelligence committee claims are the basis for its memo. Those materials tell a very different story than the conspiracy theory concocted by Chairman Nunes and being repeated in the press.”

Nadler also notes concerns with reports that Russian bots are promoting the #releasethememo hashtag and “attempting to amplify this message.”

Rep. Nadler isn’t the first Democrat to come out against the memo ahead of its release.

Ranking House Intelligence Committee member Adam Schiff also pushed back against it, saying Nunes’ memo was “rife with factual inaccuracies,” and “is meant only to give Republican House members a distorted view of the FBI.”

Meanwhile Republicans including Rep. Matt Gaetz say the memo highlights injustices that go “to the very foundations of democracy.”

“I think that this will not end just with firings,” Gaetz told Fox News last week. “I believe there are people who will go to jail.”

The House may vote as early as next week on whether to release the memo, which the president would then have to sign off on.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders on Tuesday said President Trump would likely be inclined to sign off on a release of the memo in the interest of “full transparency.”

“We certainly support full transparency and we believe that is at the House Intel committee to make that decision at this point,” Sanders said. “It sounds like there are some members in the House that have some real concerns with what is in that memo and feel very strongly that the American public should be privy to see it.”

6459,7397,FBI Blocked Information About Peter Strzok From Its Website,"The FBI seal is seen outside the headquarters building in Washington, DC on July 5, 2016. (Photo: YURI GRIPAS/AFP/Getty Images)The FBI said Tuesday it will not recommend charges over Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server as secretary of state, but said she had been ""extremely careless"" in her handling of top secret data. The decision not to recommend prosecution will come as a huge relief for the presumptive Democratic nominee whose White House campaign has been dogged by the months-long probe. / AFP PHOTO / YURI GRIPAS (Photo credit should read YURI GRIPAS/AFP/Getty Images)

The FBI blocked all information on its website about a top counterterrorism official who was kicked off of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation for sending politically-biased text messages to an FBI lawyer.

“FBI site blocked all the information about him,” reads a Google response to a search conducted of the FBI website for Peter Strzok, the embattled FBI agent.

It was revealed on Saturday that Strzok was removed from Mueller’s team in August after the Department of Justice’s inspector general discovered that he exchanged anti-Trump and pro-Hillary Clinton text messages with his mistress, an FBI lawyer named Lisa Page who also worked on the Mueller team. (RELATED: 6 Questions That Mueller Should Answer About Anti-Trump Investigator)

Strzok was sent to the FBI’s human resources department. The circumstances of the demotion remained a mystery for several months, with Mueller’s office refusing to provide background information on the personnel move.

The revelation of Strzok’s biased texts is significant because of his central role in both the Russia investigation and the Clinton email probe. As the FBI’s No. 2 counter-terrorism official, Strzok helped start both of the investigations. He also conducted interviews with former national security adviser Michael Flynn in the Russia investigation and with Clinton and several of her top aides in the email inquiry.

It is not known when the FBI blocked information about Strzok on its website. A request for comment submitted to the bureau was not returned.

The Google search for information on Strzok returns one document involving the FBI employee — a May 16, 2016 email in which FBI officials were asked to review a draft of a statement that then-FBI Director James Comey planned to give at the conclusion of the Clinton email investigation.

The FBI published that document on its Freedom of Information Act portal. Strzok was identified on Monday as the FBI official who edited the language in Comey’s so-called exoneration statement. He changed a phrase referring to Clinton’s email actions as “grossly negligent” to “extremely careless.”

The change was significant because gross negligence in the handling of classified information is a federal crime, whereas extreme carelessness is not a legal term.

The FBI has not blocked information for other FBI officials listed in the Comey draft email.

Update: A spokesman for the FBI contacted The Daily Caller after this article was published to say that the bureau did not block information about Strzok from the bureau’s website.

6478,7416,Trump Announces Massive Expansion In Offshore Drilling; Environmentalists Outraged,"Trump Announces Massive Expansion In Offshore Drilling; Environmentalists Outraged

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

In December 2017, during the twilight days of the previous administration, as one of Barack Obama’s last executive actions the former president formally blocked offshore oil and gas drilling in most of the Atlantic and Arctic Ocean, responding to a call from environmentalists who say the government needs to do more to prevent drilling in environmentally sensitive areas of U.S.-controlled oceans.

The move was not surprising: Obama had been expected to take the action by invoking a provision in a 1953 law that governs Outer Continental Shelf offshore leases, and he did just that to block drilling in federal waters in the Arctic’s Chukchi Sea and most of its Beaufort Sea. He also protected 21 underwater canyons in the Atlantic Ocean from drilling.

At the time, we said that the “move will likely be overturned promptly by the administration of Donald Trump.” And, a little over a year later, this is precisely what happened on Thursday afternoon, when the Trump administration announced it is proposing to greatly expand the areas available for offshore oil and natural gas drilling, including off the Pacific and Atlantic coasts.

Speaking to reporters, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said that “the Trump administration is proposing to make more than 90 percent of the U.S. outer continental shelf available for oil leasing” adding that he is “proposing 25 of 26 planning areas on the Outer Continental Shelf be considered for responsible and regulated leasing” and that “nearly all of the nation’s outer continental shelf is being considered for drilling, including areas off the coasts of Maine, California, Florida and Alaska” in the first major step toward the administration’s promised expansion of offshore drilling.

The proposal, which environmentalists immediately panned as an environmental disaster and giveaway to the fossil fuel industry, is far larger than what was envisioned in President Trump’s executive order last year seeking a new plan for the future of auctions of offshore drilling rights. That order asked Zinke to consider drilling expansions in the Atlantic and Arctic oceans, according to The Hill.

The plan is part of Trump’s agenda to boost domestic oil and natural gas production to create “energy dominance” and unlock the nation’s “great energy wealth.”

There’s more to come as Thursday’s announcement was just one of three major steps the administration must take to write a new plan for offshore drilling rights sales. After taking public comments on the proposal, officials must revise it and put out a new proposal and then finalize it, a process that could take more than a year.



At each of those steps, Interior can remove areas from consideration for drilling, but cannot make new areas available.

* * *

In the immediate aftermath of the announcement, environmentalists slammed the proposal as a giveaway to the oil industry.



“The Trump administration’s dramatic expansion of offshore oil drilling is beyond reckless,” said Alex Taurel, deputy legislative director at the League of Conservation Voters.”Seaside communities, businesses, and elected officials from both parties have consistently opposed risky offshore drilling because of the grave threat it poses to their way of life, our climate, and local economies that rely on tourism and fishing,” he said quoted by The Hill.

“This radical offshore drilling free-for-all is a clear example of politics over people, ignoring widespread local and state opposition,” said Diane Hoskins, campaign director at Oceana.

The announcement also garnered some Republican opposition. Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) said he would fight attempts to allow drilling near his state. “I have already asked to immediately meet with Secretary Zinke to discuss the concerns I have with this plan and the crucial need to remove Florida from consideration,” Scott said in a statement.

1334,1558,Google’s AI Is Now Capable of Making Its Own Children,"As you may know, Google is quite interested in AI. That being said, they are working on some pretty amazing things.

They have as it seems, managed to create artificial intelligence that can then create its own artificial intelligence. Yes, their AI can pretty much make baby AI.

The company made a post on one of their blogs about this interesting feat months ago and I am completely amazed and surprised I didn’t see it till now. Their Automated Machine Learning system is given a controller AI and then it proposes the designs for the; as they called it ‘child’ AI. From this point, the child AI is given a task and feedback for this task is sent to the controller AI, AKA the parent.

According to their post, this approach can design models that achieve accuracies on par with ‘state-of-art’ models designed by machine learning experts. The parent is able to improve how the child is and can design a second or more. The parent could end up with thousands of children.

The machine-chosen architecture does share some common features with the human design, such as using addition to combine input and previous hidden states. However, there are some notable new elements — for example, the machine-chosen architecture incorporates a multiplicative combination (the left-most blue node on the right diagram labeled “elem_mult”). This type of combination is not common for recurrent networks, perhaps because researchers see no obvious benefit for having it. Interestingly, a simpler form of this approach was recently suggested by human designers, who also argued that this multiplicative combination can actually alleviate gradient vanishing/exploding issues, suggesting that the machine-chosen architecture was able to discover a useful new neural net architecture.

This approach may also teach us something about why certain types of neural nets work so well. The architecture on the right here has many channels so that the gradient can flow backwards, which may help explain why LSTM RNNs work better than standard RNNs.

These AI that were created by AI work quite well and are without a doubt more amazing that I would have ever imagined for them to be. They can make things more efficiently than some human engineers even. More recently the Automated Machine Learning System has been brought up, it seems there is much more to it than we thought.",http://awarenessact.com/googles-ai-is-now-capable-of-making-its-own-children/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

""Preston Sharp Thank You for Your Service""

Flags and Flowers Honor Veterans Every Day, Not just on a Holiday



When I called Preston Sharp, he answered the phone. I heard the voice of a very young person. However, as the conversation ensued, I heard words of commitment, well beyond the age of the person on the other end of the line. When I met Duane Ehmer in Red Bluff, California, he handed me the business card of Preston C. Sharp. He had obtained the card when he visited Preston at a cemetery where Sharp was busy planting flags and artificial flowers (Red Carnations) on the graves of military veterans. Duane, a veteran himself, knew that I was a Vietnam Veteran, and felt that I would be interested in this story. That has become an understatement, as I interviewed with Sharp.

When Preston, now 12 years old, started setting Flags and Flowers on graves back in 2015, he made a commitment that he has held to since then. But, more about that, later. On Veterans Day, 2015, he went to his grandfather’s grave. His grandfather had been in the Navy. He thought that there would be flags on the graves, but there weren’t. He was frustrated that they were not being properly honored on such a day. So, he decided that he wanted to get funding so that they would be honored for their service. When he returned home, he set up a GoFundMe account in which he raised $100.00 on the first day. With that and subsequent funding, he placed over 40,000 flags and flowers on Veteran’s graves. To place flags and flowers, he can spend two or more hours in a cemetery. If the headstone is dirty, he cleans it. He then says aloud the veteran’s name and a “Thank you for your service”. He was conducting visits every Sunday, from Redding, California, where he lives, to Sacramento. However, he has now branched out into other states; his goal is to eventually get to every state in the union. To his credit, he has placed flags and flowers in California, Nevada, Oregon, Virginia, and Florida. A commendable start with 10% of the states. This includes 30 to 35 cemeteries. Often, local people in his target location assist him with his work. This work includes replacing torn flags or replacing flowers, He told me, when asked how long he would continue doing “flags and flowers”, his answer, without hesitation, was, ” ‘til I can’t bend down anymore.”

However, his commitment to veterans does not stop with flags and flowers. Preston had occasion to visit with Tim Whiting, 71, a Vietnam Veteran from Oregon who because of deteriorating health, moved to a Redding facility. Tim had to leave his friend, a dog named Rusty, with friends in Oregon. However, the four-hour trip could only rarely be made. Preston, instead of asking for a laptop for Christmas, chose to adopt Rusty and bring him to Redding, thus allowing Tim to spend time with Rusty, whenever he wanted to. When asked why he did that to help Tim, he answered, “I would do anything to make a veteran happy,” As I told Preston, and the end of the interview, HE is what we were fighting for when we joined the service of our country. He is what America used to be about, and, hopefully, will return to being what it is about. At present, because of the distances he must travel, he can only travel when funds are available. His webpage, prestonsharp.net, has a link to donate to this very worthy cause. If you believe in America, as it should be, and you want to help this wonderful example of patriotism, please help by donating to help him reach the other 45 states, and, with such help, perhaps all of the veteran’s cemeteries in the country. So, with tears in my eyes, I say, “Preston Sharp Thank You for Your Service.”

In 1989, he began researching, investigating and studying history, law and events where the government was “pointing its guns in the wrong direction”. He began publishing a patriot newspaper, “Outpost of Freedom”, in February 1993.

Since that time, he has investigated numerous occurrences, including, Waco, the Murder of Michael Hill, Ohio Militia Chaplain, Oklahoma City Bombing, and other events. He has attended the sites to investigate the events, and has reported on his investigations.

7522,8563,Significant change is needed to make Senate function as intended,"In a more co-operative Parliament Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau’s vote, on an NDP motion last October that called for the release of Liberal and Conservative senators from their party affiliations, would have been in favour instead of against it.

While Trudeau’s comment above sheds no light on a possible divergence of views between himself and his father on a preference for strong central government, other comments on the Senate suggest there may be no divergence. Trudeau is on record as opposing the election of senators due to its potential to result in gridlock. An elected Senate, feeling its oats, may take exception to a law favoured by government in the House of Commons and in a revelation of sober second thought reject that law.

A cynic might suggest this comment was an attack on the current Prime Minister Stephen Harper with a caveat that it could be equally applied to former prime minister Jean Chretien and his infamous “stranglehold” on government. A realist would point out that the Senate’s real purpose is a regional check on an all-powerful central government – the kind of government Trudeau’s father, Pierre, championed.

Later, in a display of political one-upmanship he adopted the idea as his own. Trudeau commented in support of his new-found “idea”: “If the Senate serves a purpose at all, it is to act as a check on the extraordinary power of the prime minister and his office, especially in a majority government.”

Many commentators point to the United States for examples of this paralysis with an elected Senate. All of them fail to point out that this paralysis in not an ongoing historical phenomenon but a byproduct of what one should expect with debates as fundamental as the real world interpretation of the Second Amendment of their Constitution (a Constitution that all who hold office must swear to defend) and their deep spiral into debtor nation status – a paralysis that is eminently preferable to the potential civil strife a lack of careful consideration might bring.

Trudeau said if he were elected prime minister he would go further and appoint only independent senators. But independent in this case only means independent of party affiliation not independent to thwart government legislation. Senators would have no real independence without the democratic legitimacy conferred through being elected. An appointed senate of independents would have no more power or influence than one composed of party representatives.

Against this backdrop the Chronicle Herald ran a front page editorial – supported by The News and other Atlantic papers in the TC media chain – calling for Atlantic Canadian senators to act as a group to represent the interests of the region. The idea is to use the numerical advantage of a combined 30 senators in the 105 member Senate to advance the interests of the Atlantic provinces. The Herald likened this to a potential political “Senate Spring” that opened possibilities even Trudeau might not have imagined. While he might not have imagined every possibility surrounding this “Senate Spring” he did imagine the most important – elected senators – before he rejected it.

Independent votes would be an important component of an effectively reconstituted senate but in the absence of the legitimacy conferred by a popular vote little would change. Being able to amend, postpone and veto legislation, the Senate was constitutionally granted the power it needs to make it effective, but due to its appointed nature, the Senate has refrained from exercising its full powers. Putting the cart in front of horse may seem like a rational approach when constitutional change would be needed to make some of the more meaningful changes required but it draws attention away from the requirement of significant change: change that would make the Senate function as intended.

The oath of public office to uphold the Constitution in the United States stands in stark contrast to the Canadian experience where our constitutionally mandated, regionally representative, Senate requirement is totally ignored. Rather than politely pleading with senators to do the job they are supposed to be doing in the first place, righteous moral indignation is more appropriate.

If the Herald is serious about Senate reform they should be advocating for the election of senators.",http://canadafreepress.com/article/significant-change-is-needed-to-make-senate-function-as-intended,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

I love escapism.

But there’s a good kind and a bad kind.

The good kind is when you escape from a narrow world into a broader one. You allow your mind to take you where your body, for whatever reason, cannot go. You refuse to accept the shackles of external circumstance and exogenous suffering, and you cultivate freedom and adventure in your own heart.

The bad kind is when you escape from the possibility of a broader world into a narrower, “safer” one. You live in your mind as a way to avoid taking the difficult action your body could. You refuse to acknowledge that your shackles are the result of internal issues and self-imposed suffering, and you feed delusion and distraction in your heart.

The first kind helps us ascend the pain of this world.

The second kind prevents us from doing the hard work necessary to grow.

Escaping pain outside your domain of control is elevating. Escaping the pain inherent in self-betterment is debasing.

Dr. Leonard G. Horowitz

Honolulu, HI (1-22-18)–One week after the worst breach of civil defense security in history new evidence has emerged, beyond state and federal negligence, that confronts Hawaii officials, according to citizens and investigators attending the “Town Hall Meeting” sponsored by Governor Ige. Unanswered questions and public outrage over officials’ misrepresentations and unnerving “dumbfounding” raises probable cause to re-consider sabotage by cyber-hacking.

This report by Medical Veritas analysts for the public protection watchdog group concludes that “cyber-warfare” best explains how four well-trained staff in the civil defense control room issued the false “INCOMING” “Hawaii Ballistic Missile Alert,” after repeated “fail safe” prompts cautioned them. A supervisor even verified the “button pushing” preceding the deadly 38-minute delay in clearing the false broadcast. And days later, a similar crisis happened in Japan.

A new video published by Medical Veritas International, Inc.—the journal’s educational non-profit concerned about social distress, stress-related illnesses, and at least one death caused by the January 13, 2017 fright—shows concerned “Town Hall Hearing”-goers suffering from “post-traumatic stress disorder.” Investigators objected to FEMA procedure violations; and Space Pearl Harbor co-author, Sherri Kane received applause and smiles from Senators watching the Governor’s civil defense team being racked over the coals.

This independent cyber-crime report on the likely sabotage was sent to leading Hawaii legislators and FEMA officials by Harvard-trained public health expert and media intelligence analyst, Dr. Leonard G. Horowitz, Editor-in-Chief of Medical Veritas online.

Officials Lack Cyber-crime and Social Science Knowledge

Hawaii’s civil defense team is led by U.S. Army Retired Maj. General, Vern Miyagi and Maj. Gen. Arthur “Joe” Logan . Gross ignorance of cyber-warfare risks best explains their incompetence. Their blatant misrepresentation of their need for federal involvement in decision-making and correction-issuing caused the delay. And their concealment of the name of the falsely reported single “guy” who “pushed the wrong button” is generally maddening; while his monitored actions were likely sabotaged by cyber-hacking. Could the wrong message have been hacked into the vulnerable system causing the “right button” to broadcast a 38-minute statewide disaster? Nothing explains what happened better, according to growing evidence.

Gen. Miyagi incoherently evaded the most important procedural questions clearly phrased by distressed vacationing attorney Mitch Fine. In broken and inaudible English, Miyagi took responsibility for the crisis, but he wasn’t at the operations center at the time. He repeatedly diverted to justify his concealing the name of the single “guy” who has been falsely presumed responsible by the press, contrary to the emerging evidence of cyber security system sabotage.

Investigative journalist Kane dropped Miyagi’s mouth by asking whether the crisis was manufactured to abuse people in a “psychological experiment.” Applause and smiles followed Kane’s reasonable question to Miyagi after the Governor’s point man presented a poll measuring public attitudes requiring persuasion to counter the public’s general disinterest in nuclear preparedness.

“I’d like to see what happens to this poll after what we experienced last week,” Miyagi said during his ear-straining mind-boggling “pigeon language” forty-minute slide presentation that could not have been more difficult to discern.

Officially called “PSYOPS,” short for “psychological operations,” governments generate “polls” to gather intelligence for public persuasion; and when National Security is at stake officials turn to “military neuroscience” to better assess public perceptions and emergency response behaviors said to be critical.

“But no one is talking about this most important part of the public fright,” Kane said after the meeting. “It’s like the story of the Emperor’s New Clothes.” In that tale, everyone saw the king’s nudity, but his subjects fell silent under the spell of “evil obedience.” That is the phrase psychiatry experts use to describe the effect of fear and social programming using fear to generate apathy and silence.

Why Sabotage (Cyber-warfare) is Most Likely

There is a “preponderance of evidence” compelling the conclusion that the Governor’s team are ill-equipped to explain what happened, the likeliest explanation being sabotage:

(1) The Software Worked Fine Previously

The IPAWS warning system appeared to be operating fine. It provided ample opportunity for the four “well-trained” warning officers to stop the wrong message going out. Then there is no reasonable explanation for the excruciatingly-long delay in issuing the corrected message.

Senior HIEMA Executive Officer, Tony Clairmont, admitted being “dumbfounded” by what happened. Interviewed by the Honolulu Star Advertiser, that too is being criticized for publishing frightening, false and diversionary articles, Clairmont stated. “It’s not as simple as people think. . . . A supervisor “has to approve the action.” But it was one warning officer “who clicked the button.” And he was “a very well-trained and seasoned employee. He’s not someone we hired off the street. This was someone we could depend on. There had to be more to it.”

Precisely! A lot more to it than the superficial reporting victims are receiving.

“We’re just dumbstruck,” Clairmont said. “We owe it to ourselves and to the people of Hawaii to get to the bottom of what happened.”

The lack of intelligence within Gov. Ige’s administration is shown by Lt. Col. Charles Anthony, a spokesman for the Hawaii Department of Defense. He told the Huffington Post that it took more than 30 minutes to send a follow-up alert because their system did not have a feature that allowed employees to send follow-up alerts after one is already sent.

“Based on my investigation this does not appear to be correct,” Attorney Fine responded. Fine a California lawyer was at the Honolulu Airport airport at the time of the false alert. Fine, who completed the 2 hour FEMA online course to operate as a warning officer stated, “It took me two hours of study to complete the course, and after speaking with AlertSense–an IPAWS software originator,” Fine explained, “an all – clear message could have been easily generated by the system, it’s not a complicated process.”

This evidence leaves any reasonably intelligent investigator to consider the “single button pusher” probably pushed the right button, but was dumbfounded, like the rest of his team, with what happened.

The only reasonable explanation here is sabotage. That is, someone with hacking expertise breached the system online, and changed the code to issue the false message when the “right button” was pushed.

And given the fact that the same thing happened in Japan, and that there are relatively few agents with this hacking capability operating geo-politically and commercially, the field of suspects is narrow.

(2) The Pattern of Facts Evidences Sabotage and Commercial Crime

“They had the same message,” Kane told Miyagi. “So, how could Japan have the same message as Hawaii if it was an ‘accident’?” The government official had no audible answer, and Senator Clarence Nishihara quickly took the microphone from Kane and recessed the session.

Kane’s question opened a Pandora’s box of evil. The source of the Japanese alert was NHK. This company specializes in communications technologies for public persuasion. They research and develop spin-off technologies and companies for profit, a ploy learned from U.S. and British universities, although they are protected by the government. NHK works cooperatively with Western intelligence agencies and cyber-security companies likewise.

To have the same false unprecedented message go out twice on two far removed continents only days apart gives any reasonably intelligent person probable cause to consider an organized crime featuring cyber-sabotage. And the financial motives for doing so are spelled out on NHK online network of private (for profit) businesses supplying cyber-security services just as nuclear missile threats from North Korea jointly threaten America and Japan. Too convenient a “coincidence” to be dismissed.

Compounding the pattern and evidence the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suddenly, inexplicably, and damagingly cancelled a January 16 meeting that was scheduled to focus on the “Public Health Response to a Nuclear Detonation.” This was correctly interpreted as “the health body responding to heightened rhetoric of nuclear war between the U.S. and North Korea,” said the Washington Times. After six months of planning with FEMA officials to co-host the event, pay for speakers, pay for publicity, and arrange accommodations, the lame excuse given for the cancellation reported on January 12, 2018—one day before the Hawaii crisis—was that the flu was more important. Incredible.

A more reasonable explanation for the flu being more important than a nuclear crisis is the public perception and suspicion that the perfectly-timed federal event would have immediately following the Hawaii “accident” for some concealed conflict-of-interest.

And if all the above is not convincing conspiracy enough, NBC showed up at the Hawaii Emergency Management Civil Defense Bunker a few hours before the false alert. The timely appearance tied the CDC’s sudden switch to flu vaccines to the network’s partner, Bill Gates–co-founder of MicroSoft–the “MS” in MSNBC. Gates is a leading depopulation strategist and media persuasion artist. He has repeatedly proclaimed the benefits of vaccines to reduce 15% of the world’s population–approximately 800 million people. Not only is the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation leading this charge as the world’s leading vaccine distributor or “bio-hacker,” but the computer pioneer warned only a year ago that bioterrorism is likely to be more deadly than nuclear threats.

CNN published this link heralding: “Bill Gates warns the world to prep for bio-terrorism.” CNN was the “news network” banished from Trump’s White House press conferences as punishment for their “FAKE NEWS.” This news source paired this prophetic propaganda with the “Doomsday Clock” announcement about the risks from nuclear weapons being urgent.

Last, but not least, a world leader in intelligence crunching and population persuading, the Royal Institute of International Affairs, commonly known as Chatham House, has a mission to advance commerce in cyber-space war-making. The book Space Pearl Harbor presents the most advance intelligence in this field pursuant to the Thirty Meter Telescope planned for the Big Island of Hawaii. Chatham House’s foundational mission is to secure the markets as changing international issues and current affairs challenge global commerce. The global think tank’s scholarly treatment of the hottest topics in military “defense strategy” compounds the evidence we see compounding in Maj. Gen. Miyagi’s camp in Hawaii. Chatham House scholars best explain the assault Hawaii officials are ill-prepared to recognize as it hides beneath the mask of a civil defense cyber-fed video display prompting life-threatening actions. “Technological advances and the human factor mean it is no longer sufficient (or perhaps even possible) to isolate computer systems from the internet, a process known as air-gapping .” Chatham House gives several similar examples of cyber intrusions for espionage or sabotage much like what Hawaii witnessed on January 13, 2018. (1)

Governor Ige’s administrators are obviously out of their league when it comes to cyber-security, cyber-warfare, or even FEMA warning procedures based on their recent actions. Given information on a need to know basis only in military circles, they apparently have no knowledge of what’s happening across town at Booz Allen Hamilton, or even in their own “Fusion Center’s” intelligence operations supervised by the CIA and DHS in favor of the lucrative world of nuclear cyber-warfare and security systems commerce.

“Follow the money” to new contracts for social engineering, marketing, and gaining public acceptance of expensive defense technology, cyber security and warning systems administered through AT&T and its suppliers for stockholders. Depending on public support and legislative appropriations, AT&T’s “First Net” profits are expected to far exceed the $40 billion the stockholders investment to control all emergency alerts issued to and through first responders.

Also consider the Department of Defense’s intelligence agency Booz Allen Hamilton in Honolulu was given first $40 million to handle breaches of nuclear computer security, hacking opportunities, and social engineering, advertising, and marketing to control more than you will ever know. Later, the company was awarded a $5 billion contract for Department of Defense cybersecurity.(5)

Booz Allen is Pacific headquarters for the American military (especially U.S. Navy and National Security), and private multi-national businesses depend on their intelligence too, each desiring to know precisely what the public and defenders will do in the event of a real incoming ballistic missile. With the same “mistake” made by Japan’s leading behavioral science data collector and propaganda broadcaster, NHK TV, only days later the military importance of the “drill” to our Western allies opposing North Korea cannot be under-estimated.

Incredibly , Maj. Gen. Miyagi advised the Town Hall audience that to know if a nuclear missile alert is real or false, you need to keep up with current events. Watch more television, he advised. You will then know if diplomatic relations between N. Korea and the U.S. are favorable. If not, you will know that an alert at that time is false, or simply a drill. (You can’t make this up.)

It is public knowledge that Booz Allen is the firm spawned Edward Snowden. Therefore, this depth of cyber-crime capability might be expected, given the company’s history. You might recall Snowden’s Wikileaked news generated global terror that “Big Brother is Watching You!” That great advertising sold security systems using fear of the threat to generate the social control meme, forcing people to purchase all kinds of cyber-security software and equipment. This was wonderful for the agents holding concealed interests in abusing the intelligence firms cyber-capabilities.

Ironically, Booz Allen is only a few miles away from where this “Preparedness Meeting” took place, not far from Pearl Harbor where the U.S. Navy awarded Senator Daniel Inouye its Heritage Award for appropriating massive amounts of money to the military. Inouye also chaired the Senate Intelligence Committee between 1976 and 1979. Inouye succeeded Idaho Sen. Frank directing the Church Committee. That fascinating gathering blew the lid off the CIA’s illegal chemical and biological weapons experiments done on unwitting civilians and military personnel. The CIA’s classic MKULTRA “mind control” program featured propaganda and psycho-active chemicals. LSD, like the modern “DMT,” was opposed Inouye who was nonetheless blackmailed to temper his ethics.

After behaving himself, Inouye chaired the Senate Select Committee on Secret Military Assistance to Iran and the Nicaraguan Opposition from 1987 until 1989. Compromised by the Deep State of his age, Inouye admitted:

[There exists] a shadowy Government with its own Air Force, its own Navy, its own fundraising mechanism, and the ability to pursue its own ideas of the national interest, free from all checks and balances, and free from the law itself.[20]

And the pattern of abusing citizens of the United States in Hawaii beginning with those in the Territory of Hawaii, and before that the Kingdom of Hawaii, is neglected public knowledge; no different from the widespread victimization of Hawaii citizens by organized crime aided-and-abetted by the corrupted courts, bribed legislators, and crooked law enforcers here.

(3) Hawaii Officials’ Lacking Intelligence Makes Citizens Susceptible to Damage

Attorney Fine raised the third set of facts justifying citizens’ anger as evidence of cyber-warfare.

How so? Crisis capitalism uses public outrage to pursuade legislators to find and fund solutions.

Gov. Ige’s administration is so incompetent they were easy targets for this likely sabotage. Don’t forget, the Deep State is selling cyber-security systems and services. By showing how stupid Maj. Gen. Miyagi and Joe Logan can be made to look, the politicians will be moved to replace them. But who will replace them? Booz Allen of course, whose security system experts know best how to interface with AT&T for the successful launch of their First Net system, and then know best how to secure the system against hackers.

Tourist Fine announced at the public hearing that the FEMA license granted the state the authority to employ IPAWS procedures detailed in an easy to read follow manual. The e-book especially warned against false alerts referred to as “cry wolfs.” In the system Hawaii installed even if a “mistake” was made, the procedure required to correct the problem, the book explains, did not need federal input, unlike what Miyagi’s team thought. It was that negligence that delayed broadcasting the remedy.

Hawaii, and possibly FEMA officials too, share responsibility and liability for defying the IPAWS procedure book. The instructions empower licensees “to cancel, correct, and re-send the alert” as a public duty to remedy promptly any emergency. But the feds reserve the power to override the system in the event of the State’s inability or a damaging emergency.

The IPAWS section 6.3 addresses this question of whether federal agencies intervene when states make mistakes. The manual asks, “Does the project place limitations on re-dissemination?” The answer is “No.” And under exceptional circumstances endangering lives FEMA officials are responsible for intervening and correcting states’ mistakes.

Hawaii Emergency Management Agency spokesman Richard Rapoza told the Chicago Tribune following the event that his agency asked FEMA for clarification during the emergency about whether “rescinding an alert was an appropriate use of the warning system.” But that is a ridiculous statement given the express instructions in the IPAWS manual. Rapoza’s action caused more unnecessary delay, and is additional evidence of incompetence and negligence. Rapoza knew, or should have known, the State was authorized to immediately correct the mistake, and the warning system software was set up to immediately do that.

“There was no automatic way to send a false alarm cancellation,” Gov. Ige falsely informed the press on Saturday (at 9:05 in his first press conference broadcast). That statement defied the IPAWS procedure book.

Governor Ige extended his administration’s lie. “The [new] template will have a pre-scripted message [on it], saying ‘this is a false alarm’, and ‘the missile is not inbound.’” It will go out the same way the initial announcement went out. We didn’t have a process in place. Ige said. No automatic mechanism was in place. By falsely assuring the public this way, Ige vicariously campaigned for AT&T’s First Net deployment arranged only six (6) months earlier.

So not only do we have evidence of hacking and sabotage. We have evidence of lying or misrepresenting by Gov. Ige’s administration. We have evidence of gross incompetence of his emergency managers aiding-and-abetting what went wrong. And we have evidence of leveraging the crisis politically to advance AT&T’s (and Booz Allen Hamilton’s) security and emergency response commerce. (We also saw the abuse of this crisis for blaming President Trump for the threat coming from North Korea). (2) (3)

Instead of realizing they had probably been hacked, State officials in “damage-control” mode blamed the single fall “guy” at the switch.

Vern Miyagi took the blame personally, as any honorable military team leader would. But that didn’t help getting to the truth and final disposition of the matter. This “honorable” posture, under the circumstances, delays justice, possibly obstructs justice, and leaves citizens/victims in the dark, suspicious, resentful, and distressed.

The “fall guy” should come clean. He should be interviewed by the media. If his life is threatened, security should be provided as needed. Only when he publicly explains most candidly what he did, perhaps all correctly, will this matter be defused. The longer the public is made to suffer uncertainties, the greater the distress, social damage, and distrust of government.

(4) The Feds Also Neglected Their Duties During the State of Emergency

The State of Hawaii Emergency Operations Plan, (“HI-EOP”), Section 1.1 details the “Relationship to Federal Plans,” and federal duties to citizens during emergencies.

This section states:

“The HI‐EOP provides for integration of federal participation in state emergency operations when a federal agency is responding under its statutory authorities or when federal assistance is provided to the state following a presidentially declared disaster. This plan is intended to be compatible with the National Preparedness Framework (NPF), the National Response Framework (NRF), the National Disaster Recovery Framework (NDRF) and the National Incident Management System (NIMS).”

Gov. Ige’s duties under this plan included the following (in accordance with Section 3):

“Issuing an emergency proclamation to declare a state of emergency and exercising, as appropriate, emergency authorities . . .

“Providing strategic guidance for state response and recovery operations. . . .

“Requesting federal assistance, . . . when it is apparent state capabilities will be exceeded.”

Gov. Ige is accused of irresponsibly delaying sending out a correction because he had delegated his responsibility to his social media officials, and their delays further caused damage. Even worse, the Governor’s subsequent false statements diverted from the aforementioned facts, including false blame directed at the “fall guy” who may have been a hack victim, rather than simply negligent.

Under these circumstances of a highly probable cyber-attack committed for financial and political gains, the Governor was responsible for providing strategic guidance for state response and recovery, not “damage controlling” misrepresentations. He was to have investigated the cyber-sabotage possibility thoroughly given the “process of elimination” that dumbfounded his team. Their dumbfounding required them to obtain federal cyber-warfare expertise. A week after the event, no such efforts have been reported by the Governor’s office.

Under Section 3.3 of the HI-EOP, officials are to “[e]ngage with federal agencies with responsibilities for Federal Emergency Support Functions (FESFs) to develop and exercise integrated plans and processes that address emergency coordination across all levels of government,” but not delay in an emergency to provide local relief.

“During an emergency, the Homeland Security Division is part of the [State Emergency Response Team] SERT and performs functions described in sections 3.4.3 State Emergency Support Functions – Scope and Agency Assignments and 5.2.6 Intelligence Section.

Under Section 3.5, “Federal Government” duties the HI-EOP states:

The Federal government may become involved with a response “[w]hen Federal interests are involved, such as when incidents occur on Federal property. . . . State resources need to be augmented with federal capabilities, which are provided under the National Response Framework (NRF). . . . Federal agencies with responsibilities under the NRF also support emergency management programs on a day‐to‐day basis to help the state and its local jurisdictions to reduce the impact of disasters, increase their response capabilities and plan for the integration of federal assistance during a major disaster.”

But that statement proves negligence too, both state and federal, “because IPAWS Section 6.3 had already authorized Myagi’s team to cancel the alert and correct the message.” As soon as the feds realized the alert was false (and that occurred within a couple of minutes), they should have instantly realized Miyagi’s team was incompetent, especially after FEMA was contacted to instruct the “well trained” officials how to broadcast the “FALSE ALARM. NO MISSILE INCOMING.”

The so-called “Open Platform for Emergency Networks (IPAWS-OPEN) DHS/FEMA/PIA-046 July 17, 2017, expressly authorized Hawaii officials to immediately retract the alert.

Section 6.3 asks, “Does the project place limitations on re-dissemination?” It answers:

IPAWS-OPEN does not re-disseminate alerts. If a sent alert was incorrect, the Alerting Authority has the ability to cancel, correct, and re-send the alert. (4)

Miyagi added more irony during his “Nuclear Preparedness” slide presentation. He said “You have to know what to expect and what to do.” Myagi said the same thing during the first press conference. He said everyone is to plan ahead of time what to do.

In other words, U.S. Army Retired Maj. General, Vern Miyagi, Hawaii’s Emergency Management Agency (“EMA”) Administrator is not solely liable supervisor responsible for the unnamed “fall ‘guy’s’” “mistake,” nor is Governor Ige is where the buck stops. But new evidence from procedural manuals and FEMA licensing requirements show FEMA’s top officials.

(5) The Orchestrated Administration of False Messages by State and Federal Officials, Coupled with the Media’s Silence and Negligence Concerning Clear and Present Security Industry Conflicting Interests, Related and Obvious Political Overtones, and General Neglect of Public Duties Depriving People of their Rights Under the First Amendment, Compound Evidence of Sabotage.

Additional evidence of an orchestrated PSYOPS triggered by the proposed sabotage includes the false context of the crisis. Supposedly, the missile was incoming from China’s ally, North Korea. And Miyagi urged citizens to keep up with current political events unfolding in that region. But everyone neglected the “elephant under the carpet.” Korea nuking Oahu China’s would have grossly negative consequences on Korea, and great incentive to nuke especially Honolulu where Chinese industrialists have heavily invested during the past decade.

Nor did Miyagi and Logan know why some loud alarms went off in some communities, but others not. “They are separate systems,” Miyagi admitted.

And that admission gave more cause to realize a coordinated covert operation was being administered by a powerful federal agency beyond Miyagi’s knowledge.

Compounding this evidence of coordinated Deep State cyber-crime, Miyagi also admitted that certain cell phone companies broadcast the warning while others did not.

Only federal intelligence agencies and hacking experts have the power to automatically trigger some wireless companies, but not others, to broadcast phone alerts. Hawaii’s state police and civil defense officials lack this capability.

Certainly, the single “guy” was not the only responsible party. The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) must have known about this horrible mistake by 8:08AM. Their officials have cell phones, and they are supposed to be in steady contact with Hickam Air Force Base at Pearl Harbor. That Joint Base Pearl Harbor–Hickam organization serves the Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) that load planes with nuclear bombs that are supposed to be airborne within a few minutes of an alert coordinated with the Strategic Air Command (SAC).

On several occasions during the 1970s and 80s these groups made mistakes administering false alarms. Surely by 2018 they would have nearly instant access to false alarm correction systems linking federal and state emergency response personnel and their communications systems. Why did it take these forces nearly an hour to respond? Likewise with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA.

So the official excuse–the single “guy” at the switch–seems ridiculous, outrageous, certainly unreasonable, especially when compared with the social PSYOPS thesis and the news media’s abuse of the public for months prior to this event. As the unprecedented Star Advertiser image shown below evidences, covert interests launched this attack against peaceful enjoyment of life and property in Hawaii months ago.

Conclusion

The official excuses given for the 38-minute delay in correcting the false alarm don’t make sense, nor does the cancellation of the CDC nuclear preparedness conference scheduled for three days later, without considering commercial sabotage, crisis capitalism, and PSYOPS. (1)

Alternatively, if we accept the excuse that the “well-trained” warning official made a mistake, it shows the State of Hawaii hires gross incompetents to receive training, to push the government’s most important buttons. We’d have to accept how dysfunctional our civil defense and governmental security systems are in the wake of a ballistic missile threat. We would thus be appalled at the notion of nuclear annihilation and protest widely. If we accept the official story, it shows how taxpayers have been defrauded into believing our security systems are viable. It shows how vulnerable we are to those on government payrolls administering “preparedness” and “defense strategies.” It shows the most advanced technologies and communications systems are susceptible to human errors. And it shows we are not protected from ego-maniacs in politics targeting any city with a nuclear bomb. It shows that all nuclear weapons MUST be banned immediately by every nation in accordance with World Beyond War justifications and common sense.

But since little of the above showings are politically correct or admitted by Gov. Ige’s administrators, the other conclusion is most reasonable. That is, SABOTAGE, cyber-crime, and PSYOPS.

(2) In an article titled, “What You Should Know About Hawaii’s Ballistic Missile False Alarm, According To A Former Navy Emergency Manager,” Shawn VanDiver–a 12-year Navy veteran and university instructor, identified Governor Ige’s false statements.

Mr. VanDiver credibility is established by his service on several boards focused on human trafficking, national and international security, and emergency management. Within hours of the disaster VanDiver published a detailed account of the technologies and procedures in place, and the governor’s material misrepresentation and omission of these facts:

“The governor of Hawaii claims that during a shift change, an operator simply hit the wrong button. Well, it doesn’t exactly work that way. These alerts are not actuated by physically pushed buttons because the number of buttons that would require, for all of the different types of alerts, would be unwieldy. An operator would either type in the desired alert (or select from canned messages), select which communications mediums they’d like to use and the populations they’d like to alert, and then hit “send” and then again confirm that they really want to send that message. The canned messages might be available as electronically selectable on a computer screen (like a Windows button) but a “confirm” dialogue would still be required.”

Accordingly, we know that someone, more likely two people, in Hawaii’s EMA at the helm during the “shift change” would have needed to think about whether or not they really wanted to broadcast that message over the select wireless services linked into the system. So this wasn’t simply one mistake made by one person.

“Time will tell what really happened,” VanDiver continued, “but as a Certified Emergency Manager (CEM) who helped set up the Mass Notification System for a major military base, I know that what likely occurred was a serious breach in procedure at Hawaii EMA. . . . PACOM immediately released a message saying that there was no threat, so why didn’t Hawaii EMA immediately send a retraction via WEA?”

(3) MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG, with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS joins, concurring in the result ruled by the U.S. Supreme Court in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 US 254, 305 – Supreme Court 1964, stated:

The conclusion that the Constitution affords the citizen and the press an absolute privilege for criticism of official conduct does not leave the public official without defenses against unsubstantiated opinions or deliberate misstatements. “Under our system of government, counterargument and education are the weapons available to expose these matters, not abridgment . . . of free speech . . . .” Wood v. Georgia, 370 U. S. 375, 389. The public official certainly has equal if not greater access than most private citizens to media of communication. In any event, despite the possibility that some excesses and abuses may go unremedied, we must recognize that “the people of this nation have ordained in the light of history, that, in spite of the probability of excesses and abuses, [certain] liberties are, in the long view, essential to enlightened opinion and right conduct on the part of the citizens of a democracy.” Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S. 296, 310. As Mr. Justice Brandeis correctly observed, “sunlight is the most powerful of all disinfectants.”

Concurring, MR. JUSTICE BLACK, with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS joined the verdict to secure “freedom to discuss public affairs and public officials [a]s unquestionably, as the Court today holds, the kind of speech the First Amendment was primarily designed to keep within the area of free discussion. To punish the exercise of this right to discuss public affairs or to penalize it through libel judgments is to abridge or shut off discussion of the very kind most needed. This Nation, I suspect, can live in peace without libel suits based on public discussions of public affairs and public officials. But I doubt that a country can live in freedom where its people can be made to suffer physically or financially for criticizing their government, its actions, or its officials. “For a representative democracy ceases to exist the moment that the public functionaries are by any means absolved from their responsibility to their constituents; and this happens whenever the constituent can be restrained in any manner from speaking, writing, or publishing his opinions upon any public measure, or upon the conduct of those who may advise or execute it.” An unconditional right to say what one pleases about public affairs is what I consider to be the minimum guarantee of the First Amendment.

In Farmer v. Brennan, 511 US 825 – Supreme Court 1994, the fact finders addressed “the level of culpability deliberate indifference entails” versus “recklessness.” “The civil law generally calls a person reckless who acts or (if the person has a duty to act) fails to act in the face of an unjustifiably high risk of harm that is either known or so obvious that it should be known. . . . The criminal law, however, generally permits a finding of recklessness only when a person disregards a risk of harm of which he is aware. . . . In Canton, interpreting Rev. Stat. § 1979, 42 U. S. C. § 1983, we held that a municipality can be liable for failure to train its employees when the municipality’s failure shows “a deliberate indifference to the rights of its inhabitants.” . . . In speaking to the meaning of the term, we said that “it may happen that in light of the duties assigned to specific officers or employees the need for more or different training is so obvious, and the inadequacy so likely to result in the violation of constitutional rights, that the policymakers of the city can reasonably be said to have been deliberately indifferent to the need.” Id. , at 390; see also id. , at 390, n. 10 (elaborating).

“Booz Allen will be the prime contractor on the five-year, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract awarded by the Department of Defense Information Analysis Centers Program Management Office, according to a company announcement. “The contract will focus on cybersecurity and information systems support.”

“Booz Allen will partner with the DoD IAC PMO and its clients to provide cybersecurity recommendations to academic, government and industry entities within the United States,” the company said. “The broad scope of work, as well as the emphasis on research and analysis, will encourage the development of countermeasures to current and emerging threats.”

On July 11, 2011[19][20] the group Anonymous, as part of its Operation AntiSec,[21] hacked into Booz Allen servers, extracting e-mails and non-salted passwords from the U.S. military.

Anonymous accused Booz Allen of working with HBGary Federal by creating a project for the manipulation of social media. Anonymous also accused Booz Allen of participating in intelligence-gathering and surveillance programs of the U.S. federal government and, as stated by Kukil Bora of the International Business Times, “possible illegal activities.”

It has been reported that HBGary Federal was contracted by the US government to develop “astroturfing software” which could create an “army” of multiple fake social media profiles to overwhelm opposition groups and make it appear that the hackers’ political position is favored by most citizens. This wire fraud seriously damages society’s integrity and legislative decision-making.

Later it was reported that while data security firm HBGary Federal was among the “Persona Management Software” contract’s bidders listed on a government website, the job was ultimately awarded to a firm that did not appear on the FedBizOpps.gov page of interested vendors. “This contract was awarded to a firm called Ntrepid,” Speaks wrote to Raw Story.

HBGary had made numerous threats of cyber-attacks against WikiLeaks. The dossier of recently exposed emails revealed HBGary Inc. was working on the development of a new type of Windows rootkit, code named Magenta, that would be “undetectable” and “almost impossible to remove.”

ABOUT THE AUTHORS

Sherri Kane and Dr. Leonard Horowitz

Dr. Leonard Horowitz, D.M.D., M.A., M.P.H., D.N.M. (hon.), D.M.M. (hon.), is the author of twenty one books, including the prophetically titled Death In The Air: Globalism,Terrorism and Toxic Warfare that came out three months before 9-11-01. That book deals with biological and energy weapons being used for population control. His three American best-sellers include: Emerging Viruses: AIDS & Ebola–Nature, Accident or Intentional? that was largely responsible for prompting explosive interest in vaccination risks and biological warfare; Healing Codes for the Biological Apocalypse, that revealed the ancient Solfeggio musical scale secreted for millennia; and Healing Celebrations: Miraculous Recoveries Through Ancient Scripture, Natural Medicine and Modern Science in which Dr. Horowitz presents his protocol for administering prevention and speedy recoveries. His most recent text, The Book of 528: Prosperity Key of LOVE, has prompted a revolution in the music industry improving recording artistry and music therapy with the use of C=528Hz(A=444Hz) tuning that produces “medicinal music.” Dr. Horowitz’s documentary, UN-VAXXED: A Docu-commentary for Robert De Niro won five international awards, including “Best Film – 2016” in London and Geneva competitions.

If you do a Google search on Sherri Kane, you will probably notice she has been widely defamed by the Troll Triad and their “socks”–a seemingly large group of racist, anti-Semitic, and sexist men who obviously feel their lives spent on the Internet libeling her is a profitable pastime.

Here are some political reasons why:

Sherri Kane is America’s gutsiest investigative journalist, news commentator, psycho-social analyst, and political activist, specializing in uncovering what predators do to women, children, and even animals. She exposes human and animal rights violators, child sex traffickers, and human slavery networks, several involving high ranking government officials.

Sherri does not hesitate to investigate, analyze, and vet the dark world of government and intelligence agencies’ corruption, and agents’ complicity in organized crimes. She refutes the propaganda published to manipulate and damage people, and exposes what is being concealed by the FBI/CIA’s COINTELPRO (that was supposed to have stopped abusing people and depriving human rights in 1976 by Acts of Congress). Sherri delves into conspiracy realities so dark that very few people dare to study them.

Related to this article, for instance, you may have heard of the political fracas involving certain members of Congress, a high ranking official in the Republican Party, and the mysterious disappearances and abuses of children at “Boys Town” in Nebraska, called “The Franklin Cover-up.” Thanks to Ms. Kane’s heroic investigative reporting, the matter has now been exposed as “The Franklin Double-coverup.”

You may recall the Gulf Oil Crisis, maybe even the extensive coverage Jesse Ventura and TruTV gave to the “Conspiracy Theory” implicating Halliburton, BP, and TransOcean in the intentional explosion and environmental devastation in the Gulf of Mexico. Ms Kane sourced the story and appears on the segment.

Sherri wrote the foreword to Dr. Horowitz’s music-industry-transforming book, The Book of 528: Prosperity Key of Love, and co-produced and is co-starring in Dr. Horowitz’s controversial docu-comedy PHARMAWHORES: The SHOWTIME Sting of Penn & Teller, winner of the 2010 Accolade Award for “Uniqueness in Documentary Film-making.” That film heavily influenced online video production for thousands of subsequent Internet producer. Sherri also stars in Dr. Horowitz’s latest documentary, UN-VAXXED: A Docu-commentary for Robert De Niro that won five international awards, including “Best Film – 2016” in London and Geneva competitions. Ms. Kane also co-wrote Space Pearl Harbor, reviewed in the 39-minute news program seen HERE.

Ms. Kane is the Vice President of Medical Veritas online journal, has published works in newspapers, magazines and many websites, and has been interviewed worldwide including on Al Jazeera’s A9 Turkey, The Veritas Show, the BBC’s Talk Radio Europe, Late Night In The Midlands, WAC Connecticut, LA Talk Radio, and many others. She co-hosts the Hollywood Spin series of film reviews with Dr. Horowitz viewed on RevolutionTelevision.net and Vimeo’s Revolution Television Channel.

Sherri is currently collaborating with Dr. Horowitz on various projects including Healthy World Organization (HWO), the alternative to the corrupt World Health Organization (WHO), HealthyWorldAffiliates.com, and advancing the power of “528 Hz” frequency for global healing, as experienced at 528Records.com, 528Radio.com, and 528Revolution.com.

For their work together exposing devil-doing operatives in the media, Dr. Horowitz and Ms. Kane were christened “The HOROKANE” by Alma C. Ott, exposed in this article.",http://beforeitsnews.com/terrorism/2018/01/nuclear-ballistic-missile-denial-ability-hits-fema-officials-in-its-licensing-procedure-and-failure-to-intervene-in-the-states-civil-defense-meltdown-defying-the-i-2460938.html,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

It has been a scorched earth weekend in the PR war between Donald Trump and the FBI.

In the aftermath of the report that the FBI’s top lawyer – and suspected FBI leaker – James Baker, had been reassigned, and at the same time as news hit that FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe was set to retire as a result of the “Trump Insurance Policy” debacle (but only once he becomes eligible for pension benefits), Trump lashed out at top FBI officials on Saturday and Sunday, his latest in a stream of criticism aimed at an agency that has seen a sudden spike in high profile departures after Peter Strzok’s publicly disclosed text message revealed a stunning climate of extreme anti-Trump bias at the FBI – including one still to be determined “Trump Insurance Policy” – just as Trump had suggested all along.

Trump swiped at multiple agency officials in a string of tweets Saturday afternoon, suggesting that FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe may have been compromised by political donations and ripping former FBI Director James Comey as a leaker.

“How can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the man in charge, along with leakin’ James Comey, of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33,000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700,000 for wife’s campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation?” Trump tweeted.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 23, 2017

The tweet was followed moments later by a comment on reports that McCabe is looking to retire from the bureau in the coming months as reported yesterday, in the aftermath of the “Trump Insurance Policy” fiasco. Trump noted that McCabe may seek retirement in March, when he would receive his full pension benefits. Trump wrote that the deputy bureau chief was “racing the clock to retire with full benefits,” adding, “90 days to go?!!!”

FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is racing the clock to retire with full benefits. 90 days to go?!!! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 23, 2017

Rounding off the Saturday tweetstorm was a reference to reports that James Baker, the FBI’s top lawyer, had been reassigned. Trump reacted to that development with a simple “Wow” on Twitter, though news of Baker’s reassignment had surfaced days earlier.

Wow, “FBI lawyer James Baker reassigned,” according to @FoxNews. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 23, 2017

The tweets Saturday from Trump, who has repeatedly jabbed at McCabe by citing his wife’s ties to prominent Democrats, came after the FBI deputy testified for many hours behind closed doors on Capitol Hill this week, responding to questions from lawmakers on three congressional panels probing the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia and the bureau’s work. As we reported, Congressional investigators said that McCabe dodged questions on the “Trump-Russia” dossier, and his testimony “contained numerous conflicts with the testimony of previous witnesses” so much that the House Intelligence Committee is planning to issue new subpoenas next week to Justice Department and FBI Personnel.

“It’s hard to know who’s telling us the truth,” said one House investigator after McCabe’s questioning – which was reportedly spearheaded by Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC). When asked about funding for the “Trump dossier”, McCabe claimed he could not recall whether or not the Clinton campaign and the DNC funded the report – despite the alleged existence of documents which McCabe signed establishing his knowledge of its financing and provenance. Curiously, ahead of McCabe’s Thursday appearance in front of the House Judiciary Committee for a “transcribed interview,” the DOJ announced that FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe “will not be in a position to discuss matters that are within the scope of the investigation of Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III.”

On Sunday, Trump’s feud with the FBI resumed, when the president used a tweet to quote Fox, stating that that FBI’s Andrew McCabe, “in addition to his wife getting all of this money from M (Clinton Puppet), he was using, allegedly, his FBI Official Email Account to promote her campaign. You obviously cannot do this. These were the people who were investigating Hillary Clinton.”

.@FoxNews-FBI’s Andrew McCabe, “in addition to his wife getting all of this money from M (Clinton Puppet), he was using, allegedly, his FBI Official Email Account to promote her campaign. You obviously cannot do this. These were the people who were investigating Hillary Clinton.” — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 24, 2017

To be sure, Democrats argue that the Republican criticisms of McCabe and the FBI are an effort to undermine Mueller as his investigation ramps up, and to give Trump cover should he try to remove Mueller, a step the White House insists is not on the table. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, responded to Trump’s criticisms Saturday afternoon. “FBI would set a dangerous precedent if it forced out dedicated career public servants in capitulation to Trump and (White House) pressure,” Schiff tweeted. “President has already removed one top FBI leader — Comey — over Russia; McCabe would be another.”

None other than James Comey, now in active marketing mode for his upcoming book, tweeted that “Sadly, we are now at a point in our political life when anyone can be attacked for partisan gain. James Baker, who is stepping down as FBI General Counsel, served our country incredibly well for 25 years & deserves better. He is what we should all want our public servants to be” to which some twitter commentators had a sarcastic response…

If by that you mean Leaking classified information for political gain No wonder @realDonaldTrump sacked your unethical incompetent a$$ https://t.co/x6zAxzbes7 — Jim Hanson (@Uncle_Jimbo) December 24, 2017

As a reminder, what really happened according to the Washington Post, Baker, the FBI’s general counsel, communicated with Mother Jones reporter David Corn in the weeks leading up to the November 2016 election. Corn was then the first to report the existence of the Trump dossier on Oct. 31.

Meanwhile, some Republicans have called for McCabe’s ouster, accusing him of political bias, particularly over the fact that his wife received hundreds of thousands of dollars in contributions to her 2015 Virginia state Senate campaign from a super PAC led by a Clinton ally. At the same time, Benjamin Wittes, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and friend of Comey, cautioned in a tweet on Saturday that the deputy director’s exit from the FBI may not be part of any kind of larger “purge” at the bureau. Then again, if more evidence of FBI collusion against Trump emerges, the “purge” – or the draining of the FBI/DOJ swamp as some have dubbed it – may just be getting started.

Further stoking the PR war between Trump and the FBI, a number of Republican lawmakers have questioned the FBI’s objectivity and fairness in recent months, particularly regarding McCabe’s work at the agency, while recent revelations that FBI Peter Strzok – who was in charge of the FBI’s probe into Hillary’s email server and was leading the investigation into Trump’s Russian collusion – had sent text messages critical of Trump during the presidential race, only served to undescore speculation that the FBI may have been the critical cog in the “deep state’s” plan to avoid a Trump presidency.

5288,6002,Megyn Kelly: did NBC hire her to destroy FOX?,"Subscribe to Canada Free Press for FREE

Her brand of good looks doesn't fly at NBC. It's a negative. The audience sees her as the FOX fox who's trying to fake her way into liberal credentials

Megyn Kelly: did NBC hire her to destroy FOX?

(To read about Jon’s mega-collection, The Matrix Revealed, click here.) NBC lured FOX ice queen Megyn Kelly into their house because…



NBC execs are either dumb as rocks, or it’s part of a plan to send FOX down the drain.



The dumb-as-rocks part: NBC gave Kelly her own Sunday night “news” show; that time slot, up against CBS’ 60 Minutes, is a sure loser. NBC plans to roll out Kelly in their morning line-up, where cheery and happy and bubbly are prerequisites; Kelly works more along the line of a surgeon operating on a patient without anesthetic. NBC apparently plans to put Kelly in an afternoon slot, where Oprah and Ellen made their bones; Kelly connects with the afternoon-women audience the way a leopard connects with bunny rabbits.

If NBC-programming big shots aren’t that dumb, then they stole Kelly from FOX to facilitate the downfall of FOX, the only mainstream refuge of “conservatives.” NBC will eat her salary for a while, and then, as one pundit speculated, they’ll dump her at MSNBC, the extreme left-liberal cable cemetery, dedicated these days to haunting Trump for every move he makes or doesn’t make. Kelly will probably wind up alongside Brian Williams, who’s serving time at MSNBC for famously lying about an RPG hit his helicopter took in Iraq. The Brian and Megyn Show. She’ll turn further left, and he’ll try to rehab her image. Brian will say, “She’s both brilliant and caring. She hates injustice and tries to root it out wherever she finds it. She’s committed to righting wrongs done to people who have no voice. Megyn gives them that voice. I’m honored to be working with her. When she was in Iraq and her helicopter was shot at, I dressed a chest wound she suffered…”



Kelly was the new shining star at FOX, the latest blonde in a string of blondes. She was going to propel FOX to new heights. It was all going to work out…until it didn’t.



Now she’s on the road to doofus land. Her brand of good looks doesn’t fly at NBC. It’s a negative. The audience sees her as the FOX fox who’s trying to fake her way into liberal credentials.



But if her switch to NBC helps sink FOX further, it’s worth it. Particularly if Sean Hannity takes a ratings hit. He’s the last “conservative holdout” who’s still drawing a large audience. And he’s pro-Trump.

The MSM game goes on. Who sucks in the biggest audience? Who satisfies the advertisers? Whose warm body can be climbed over by the newest contender? Who can seem to be “with the people?” Who can lower his/her IQ sufficiently to appeal to a vital consumer demographic? Who can charm women on welfare and armchair tough guys and social justice warriors with discretionary income and people who’ll actually ask their doctors whether the latest toxic drug is right for them?



Welcome to the mainstream network minstrel show, the zoo and the amusement park and the house of mirrors and the carnival alley and the three-card street-corner hustler with a folding table and the court eunuchs operating on behalf of oligarchs and the suits consulting Amazon algorithms and the CIA assets chopping up news and the Globalists in sheep’s clothing and the Wall St. front men and the pharmaceutical agents and the policy wonks and the too-big-to-fail bankers and the mothball counter-terrorism analysts and the mid-thigh skirts with crossed legs and the discreet cleavage and the jacked-up amphetamine studio audiences and the PR agency freaks and the whose-baby-is-it barkers and the and the far-flung field reporters all over the world who take their copy straight off the wires in Washington and New York and the we-don’t know-whether-it-was-terrorism-yet police chiefs and the you-can’t say-the-US-government-created-and-funded-ISIS editors and the latest-breakthrough-cancer-treatment-is-right-around-the-corner medical reporters and the Monsanto agents and the puff adder egos and the fair and balanced affirmative action hires and the out and out Communists and the collectivist utopians and the military industrialist neocon empire builders and the think tank sophists and logic choppers and the vaccine police and the latest and great blonde:



Continued below... Megyn Kelly.



On the road to nowhere.



Unless you can somehow find it in your heart to love her.



Please love her.



She doesn’t know what world she’s operating in. She’s over her head. She’s a victim.



Destroy her, yes. But then bring her back. Reach out your hand and pull her up from the abyss.



It’ll be a good story. Promise.

In stutter steps I traverse slowly and carefully along a

darkened path littered with broken fragments of cobblestone.

my chest cavity feels cavernous as an empty canyon on a

blistering summer’s heat.

my heart beats as rapid as an old railroad clock.

My head feels as heavy as an anvil and throbs with pain.

my tongue as dry and as sandy as a cactus.

a maddening howling wind at my back pushes me forward

in an aimless direction without purpose or direction as

if a tumble weed.

I feel as if I’m cascading into a turbulent sea of insanity,

drenched in perfuse sweat. I suddenly bolt upright from

my pillow realizing I have awoke from this purgatorial nightmare.

such an illusion, devilish delusion, a state of total confusion.

so now I begin another day of drudgery,

another day’s journey into life’s great unknown.

6113,6986,My jaw dropped when I read the latest from Benedict XVI . . .,"Subscribe to Canada Free Press for FREE

It's a gift from God. And, with the former pope weighing in on the issue publicly, it may even be a game-changer.

My jaw dropped when I read the latest from Benedict XVI . . .

Since Benedict XVI resigned from the papacy and began his retirement in seclusion, he has said nothing publicly.

There’s a very good reason for that, and that’s why the most recent thing he’s written is so amazing. He’s just publicly weighed in on Cardinal Kasper’s proposal to give Holy Communion to divorced and civilly remarried Catholics. Here’s the story . . . Why is Benedict XVI so silent these days? To give his successor a free hand. If a pope emeritus continued to speak out and play a substantial role as a public figure, it could cause all kinds of problems for his successor. If the two were perceived as being in opposition to each other, it could be extremely traumatic for the Church. Hypothetically, it could even create a schism. That’s why, when St. Celestine V resigned, his successor kept him imprisoned in a castle until he died.

By choosing to live in a monastery at the Vatican and staying out of the public eye, Benedict is deliberately staying out of Francis’s way. He’s also setting a precedent for future popes emeritus. What has Benedict said since retirement? Very little. We know that he has been writing letters. In one letter, he took an atheist mathematician to the woodshed, and the mathematician later published the letter. He also wrote a speech that was read at a Roman university by his aide, Archbishop Georg Ganswein. But, in general, he has written very little that has come to public light. And none of what he has written has dealt with controversial issues in the Church. Until now. What does Benedict think of “the Kasper proposal” Over the last year, the Church has been wracked by a revival of Cardinal Walter Kasper’s proposal to give Holy Communion to divorced and civilly remarried Catholics in some circumstances. Cardinals have been publicly debating each other in the press. We don’t need to rehash the whole, sad history of that here. As we’ve watched that situation play out, I’ve repeatedly wondered what Benedict must be thinking—and doing.

7331,8361,Can Christianity and the Homosexual AGENDA Co-exist?,"In the immortal words of Rodney King “can’t we all just get along?” How nice it would be if we could. Unfortunately, it’s not always that simple. Can Christianity co-exist with homosexuality? Yes, I believe so. Can Christianity co-exist with the homosexual AGENDA? I vote a resounding NO!

Most of us assume that the homosexual AGENDA wants equality. Like those of the Civil Rights movement, who believed it fell within the government’s authority to guarantee all citizens equal protection of the law, to promote an environment that outlawed racial segregation in schools, at the workplace, by facilities that served the general public, and in voter registration.

This is not the AGENDA of the homosexual movement. It is not equality that they so rabidly pursue. It is domination! It is to the exclusion of the dominate voice in this country that inherently judges their lifestyle as immoral and perverse.

Let us think about it critically for a moment. Through the corridors of antiquities, both Christian and non-Christian philosophers and historians alike, attest to the historical facts of the Bible. Even our modern day artifacts point to the infallible recordings in the Bible of history past. Most importantly, however, the Bible, itself, forcefully declares its supremacy over all others stating it is the inspired Word of God.

For those who subscribe to the Bible’s infallible nature – meaning, it is flawless, contains no errors, and have no need of revisions – cannot co-sign those things that are called according to the Bible “indecent acts”, “shameful lusts”, “unnatural and abnormal relations”, “an abomination”, and a “wicked thing”.

Allow me to ask you to decide, if such a targeted group can peacefully co-exist with an ideology that calls them all of the above? Can they? The answer: no, they cannot. No equality can be gained if the above ideology remains a dominate presence. One of the two ideologies (i.e., Christianity or the AGENDA) must become silenced for the other to thrive. For those who believe in such, isn’t that the fundamental premise of Darwinism?

Make no mistake about it, homosexuality is a targeted group in the Bible, right along with cheats, drunkards, liars, foul-mouths, extortionists, robbers, and any other habitual sin(1 Corinthians 6:10). A major problem arises when one of these groups collectively starts engaging in political paybacks, intimidating the public into silence, and using the Law to legitimatize their way of life.

Of course, there are many religious people among us who have abandon Judeo-Christian beliefs and are pandering a message of “inclusivity” throughout the Body of Christ. Many well-meaning people have fallen prey to the AGENDA because of very real pressures to be “politically correct”, because of their lack of understanding the Word of God, and/or because of the impending political and social doom that results if one should take a firm stand in opposition.

Let us look at a real life case study of the AGENDA at work in Canada:

In 2004, Canada signed into law hate crime Bill C-250. This law includes the phrase “sexual orientation” in the groups protected against the spread of hate propaganda. At that time, Dr. Janet Epp Buckingham, director of Law & Public Policy of the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada (EFC) stated “without a clear definition of what is criminal hatred, it is ambiguous what public statements will be considered criminal.” Bruce Clemenger, president of EFC said, “While opposing the promotion of hatred against anyone, we are deeply concerned about the chilling effect this legislation may have on the legitimate expression of religious belief.”1

Fast forward to April 20, 2010, a Baptist street preacher, Dale McAlpine, was arrested and charged with causing “harassment, alarm or distress” after a homosexual police officer overheard him reciting a number of “sins” referred to in the Bible, including blasphemy, drunkenness, and same sex relationships.” After being approached by a passer-by and asked if homosexuality was a sin, the pastor then proceeded to explain that he believed it went against the Word of God. A third-party officer overheard this conversation and arrested the pastor. He spent seven hours in jail for sharing his belief – something most of us take for granted

.

Earlier this year, our own U.S. Rep. Steve King of Iowa, sent a letter to a group of Christian activists and pastors over the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 – that was signed into law late last year. In it, King states2:

“…I believe this ‘Hate Crimes’ Act is unconstitutional and marks an unprecedented move to regulate and criminalize our thoughts .”

.” “Not only will this Act create a class of people that are ‘more equal than others,’ it will hinder your ability to preach the gospel and openly teach biblical principles.”

Either we believe the Truth and the facts that are clearly laid before us or we choose to lay aside Truth and go the way of “feelings”, “opinions”, and “error”. There is no third option.

Again, the question at hand is “Can Christianity co-exist side-by-side, in blissful harmony with the Homosexual AGENDA? What say you?

As not to leave on a down note, there is hope. It is the hope found in the Gospel message, a message that sets out to redeem the person, but transform the action through the finished works of Jesus Christ.

PART I—Multiculturalism’s Ultimate Outcome

The latest traumas affecting the United States cannot help but make every American think about our demise as a cohesive, intact and functioning country. This year and last year, you witnessed Moslems shooting police officers in the streets. In cities across America, Black Lives Matter groups chanted, “Kill cops! When? Now!” National Football League players dishonor the American flag every Sunday. This week, a madman shot up an entire concert in Las Vegas. You cannot help but wonder what’s happening to our country.

America faces the most critical juncture in its 240-year history. Multiculturalism’s onslaught continues at a dizzying pace as we add 100,000 legal immigrants from 194 different countries every 30 days. Total of legal and illegal annually tabulates at 1.1 million legal and 500,000 illegals. Total 1.6 million foreign people reach our shores annually. (Source: www. NumbersUSA.org; PEW Research Center)

Indolent Americans sit on their Lazy Boy recliners wielding a remote while their country fractures before their eyes. It’s been slow for the past 40 years, but it’s quickening in every sector of our country.

In the past few years, notice New York Times Moslem bomber; Boston Marathon bombers, Arizona SB 1070 law; Moslem honor killings; Zazi Denver bomber, New York Moslem wife beheadings, San Bernardino, Fort Lauderdale, Orlando, White Cloud, Ohio State stabbings, Las Vegas and more to come….

Have you noticed more and more people speaking different languages at the supermarket? Schools? Movies? At your local bank? Have you noticed radio stations and TV crackling with Spanish or Arabic or other languages in our English speaking America? Have you seen more people disrespecting the singing of our national anthem? Have you noticed our laws being broken such as red lights being run or people fleeing accident scenes where they were the cause? Have you noticed more trash in your state and national parks, especially in California, Arizona, Texas and Georgia?

Have you noticed that when their language differs from yours, that you both shy away from each other? Have you noticed when you see Moslem women in Burkas, an emotional wall stands between them and you? Have you noticed burkas on women creeping into TV ads? In other words, advertisers force foreign countries’ dress and modes of living on us whether we like it or not.

Have you noticed more flags being flown from other countries instead of Old Glory? You won’t see the American flag being flown in Dearborn, Michigan dominated by Moslems, nor will you see it in Somaliland in Minneapolis, Minnesota where 100,000 of them dominate that area. Did you know that more Mexican flags fly from houses, cars and establishments in southern California more than the Stars and Stripes? Have you noticed what has happened to the Golden State? Texas? Arizona? How about Georgia or Miami, Florida?

Have you ever been incredulous about hearing something that sounded so preposterous that it “couldn’t be true?” Take a second look.

You are watching the “Coming Breakup of America.” That’s right. Your country! It is moving methodically, perversely, steadily and provocatively across our land. Our Congress aides it at the highest levels. It is a nation-destroying experiment being forced on Americans that will prove more disastrous than 9/11.

Recently, I read a book, Civil War II: The Coming Breakup of America by Thomas W. Chittum. This book paints a grim picture of our country’s future. At first, I felt incredulous at his supposition. But half way through the book, his research proved SO profound and SO evident that it became a page-turner. It provided a sickening look into the methodology and process whereby my own country fractures and fragments before my eyes.

“History is littered with wars which everybody knew would never happen,” said Enoch Powell.

Today, America fights two wars 10,000 miles away in Afghanistan and Iraq, while its own borders suffer an invasion so vast, so powerful, so insidiously destructive, and yet so subtle—even our own citizens can’t see it. Not yet, that is! Chittum writes, “America was born in blood.” He should know because he became a combat hardened Viet Nam veteran.

“Social, political and economic forces are pulling America apart and driving her toward a bloody conflict that may fracture the nation into several different countries,” he said. “Riots, gangs, militias, exploding crime rates, massive immigration, rising unemployment, falling wages…these fuel the fires of war.”

Notice 8.7 million unemployed and 47 million subsisting on food stamps. Notice 1 in 6 American children facing food insecurity and 13 million living below the poverty line. Notice 7 out of 10 black children born out of wedlock and growing up without fathers. Note 1.5 million Americans homeless. Every hour, 13 teens die from an overdose of drugs.

Chittum talks about nations versus empires. “Empires consist of peoples of different religions, languages, cultures, races and nationalities,” he said. “Nations are dominated by one group that makes up a majority of the population. Nations are inherently stable while empires are always unstable.”

Right now, 42 million immigrant legal citizens in the USA prove foreign born with millions more of their families chain-migrating to America. Within 30 years, more than 100,000,000 (million) more people from foreign countries will call our country their home. The sociological chaos they present cannot be comprehended.

Part 2 – Turning America Into Everybody Else’s Country

In part 2 of this series, we address Thomas Chittum’s book: The Coming Break-up of America—Civil War II.

If you looked around the United States in 1965, we featured a stable nation with 90 percent European, 7 percent African citizens, and 3 percent Latino, and mostly one religion.

Today, we’ve imported 70 million people from areas so incompatible with American culture that we recoil at the horrors of female genital mutilation, honor killings, multiple wives, and forced marriages of 12 year olds. We tolerate hundreds of different languages. Los Angeles, Miami, San Francisco and other cities speak more foreign languages than English. “If you’ll notice throughout history,” Chittum writes, “multiethnic empires break up in cataclysmic violence.”

The former Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and Lebanon provide classic examples of multiethnic empires that shattered in tribal violence. Today, France, United Kingdom, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Holland, Denmark, Germany, Spain and Italy race along the same track of self-destruction with their massive non-assimilating Muslim populations.

Kant said, “Language and religion are the great dividers.

Chittum talks about an unstable tiered society. Aristotle said, “The only stable state is the one in which all men are equal before the law.” Average American citizens watch as our U.S. Congress imports a massive underclass of illegal, Third World and uneducated poor that have become our ‘indentured servants’ as well as cyclical poverty recipients. Those immigrants, whether legal or illegal cost American taxpayers $296 billion annually according to Roy Beck of www.NumbersUSA.org. They can’t and don’t cope with first world requirements to work or engage in contributions to our society. They overwhelm California, Arizona, and Texas by sheer numbers. They crush cities like Minneapolis, Detroit, Miami, New York City, Houston, Dallas, Atlanta San Francisco and dozens more.

America supports 20 million illegal aliens that possess no allegiance to our country. A dozen cities feature more foreign-born immigrants than American citizens. Spanish-speaking radio stations own the airwaves in Los Angeles. Miami features Cuban stations. None carry any allegiance to America.

As can be seen with the current crop of disenchanted National Football League players dishonoring our flag and national anthem, we face accelerating consequences to a tiered society. While the football players quietly demonstrate against America, Antifa demonstrators riot, break glass and threaten police officers with, “No Trump, No Wall, No USA All!” Black Lives Matter marches against civil society and, in fact, marches for anarchy. At some point, we face Moslem Sharia Law demonstrators exactly like the ones screaming in Great Britain, “UK police; go to hell!”

Also developing: parallel societies of such incompatible immigrants that they enclave into separate entities.

How will it get worse? Our politicians may grant amnesty to that 20 million plus 850,000 DACA cases, which will encourage millions more. Millions of aliens hide more illegal aliens via ‘ethnic sympathy’. But what they bring us proves as dangerous as any armed invasion.

As their numbers grow, the “Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund” works to destroy US laws. La Raza, another anti-American Mexican organization, works directly for the overthrow of America. It reaches into the highest levels of our government starting with Alberto Gonzalez. Former US House of Representatives Joe Baca of California supports La Raza. What does La Raza mean? “For the Latino race, everything, everyone outside the race, nothing!” LULAC is another group that supports the ‘Reconquista of Aztlan,’ or, the retaking of the American Southwest back into Mexico.

Today, the Moslem Brotherhood and Council on American Islamic Relations, Islamic Society of America—all work to install Sharia Law into their Moslem populated areas here in the United States. Their ultimate goal: Sharia Law over the entire USA.

Notice that the Mexican president dictates to our leaders what they will do with his 12 to 15 million illegal immigrants in our country. Notice 54 Mexican consulates in our cities around America supporting his people in our country. Notice voter fraud by illegal aliens now able to throw our local and national elections. Latest demonstrators carry signs, “Today we march; tomorrow we vote.”

After three chapters, Chittum’s writing sobered me, but I still wasn’t convinced until he offered concrete numbers. “In California in 1993, 665,229 firearms were sold. That’s 1,873 per day. Enough firearms were sold to equip an infantry battalion.” For the Californians remaining, there’s a lot of frightened people readying themselves for conflict.

“California is odds-on favorite to kick off Civil War II,” Chittum said.

“The instinctive need to be a member of a closely-knit group fighting for common ideals may grow so strong that it becomes inessential what these ideals are,” said Konrad Lorenz.

Illegal Mexican border jumpers separate against being an American. The 20,000 member “18th Street Gang” in Los Angeles owns the streets. They coordinate all drug traffic, extortions of businesses, prostitutes and robberies. Their power, along with MS-13 gangs in 40 American cities, grows by the day. Over 60 percent of the members are illegal aliens and the other 40 percent are legal immigrants. Since they possess no working skills in our First World society, they find crime as an easier vocation. It’s termed ‘Third World Momentum’. Its corruption is so deep, so wide and so embedded that it’s as intrinsic as the sewer systems in those cities.

Not reported in the mainstream media, Mexico sells $50 billion in drugs to U.S. consumers annually, while American tax payers fork over $52 million to treat, interdict, prevent, arrest and deal with overdoses, suicides, car accidents and horrific destruction caused by our youth’s drug use.

How many and how much? Los Angeles sheriff files register 100,000 gang members. San Antonio features 5,000 gang members. Chicago estimates 50,000 members. Former Attorney Janet Reno estimated over 500,000 gang members imported themselves into the USA. “They commit an average of 580,000 crimes annually in our country,” Reno said more than 10 years ago.

For an example, merchants suffer $130 million in losses from shoplifting daily in the USA. That equals to $50 billion annually that you pay the difference in goods sold to you.

So why do our politicians sit and twiddle their thumbs? Why do they aid and abet by doing nothing? Can’t they see what’s happening to California? Texas? Arizona? The answer in a nutshell: they won’t look! Senators like Mitch McConnell, John McCain, Diane Feinstein, Barbara Boxer and Charles Schumer all in their late 70s and 80s—stand SO out of touch with what’s happening in America—they do not and cannot solve the problem. Such veteran House reps like Nancy Pelosi and John Cummins harangue about the problems, but offer no solutions.

Why does it all get worse and nothing gets better? Because Americans, like the proverbial frog being thrown into the pot of water and the stove being turned up to high, will keep adapting until we boil to death. The same thing happened to the Romans, French, Spanish and every other great nation that tumbled into the dustbin of history. Spain backed into submission by the Madrid train bombing. France stands on the doorstep of a nation-crushing Moslem invasion it won’t survive.

I never thought I would have to fight for my own country inside my own country. But the time is fast approaching. Again, we face another 100,000,000 (million) legal immigrants within the next 30 years. Chittum adds that if immigration continues at current rates, we won’t have enough Americans left to stand up for America.

% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

Directly below is a video teaching that profiles America’s heritage, America’s blessings, America’s spiritual responsibility, and what may be America’s future. Beneith the embedded video is a brief research paper outlining four possibilities for America’s future. This material has been prepared by one who has served the Lord in pastoral minsitry for the last 25 years.

Many have questioned why the United States is not clearly or prominently mentioned in Scripture. Surely such a world power would be part of any end times battles, especially with Israel, one of her strongest allies. Yet, there does not seem to be any apparent reference to the US. Europe is identifiable; Russia and China are pretty clear – three other world powers. Where is America?

Last days prophecies center on Israel, the Jewish people, war, and natural disasters. America has been used by God to assist the Jewish people and played a key role in helping Israel become a sovereign and independent nation. Further, America has liberated countries, aided countries impacted by natural disasters, and sent out more missionaries to more regions than any nation in history. The role that America will play in the last days, however, is not clear. Bible scholars of many nationalities want to know, not just those who live in America. A few options are noted below:

Is America profiled in Bible prophecy? There are at least four possibilities:

America is not mentioned in Scripture because she is outside the focus of John’s Revelation narrative, or because America plays no significant role in End-Time events. America is mentioned—symbolized as the great eagle in Revelation 12, or possibly Isaiah 18:1-2. America is mentioned—referenced as the Daughter of Babylon and represented by the woman who rides the Beast, or the Whore of Babylon in Revelation 13, 17 and 18. America is mentioned—referred to a young lion in Ezekiel 38.

Option 1: America is not specifically noted in Scripture.

Some Christians believe no clearly identifiable reference to America is found in End Times prophecy. Those who hold this position often suggest the US is simply outside the focus of the Revelation narrative. This certainly makes sense; the Apostle John did not even know the continent existed. It is also possible America is not mentioned because she simply plays no significant role in End-Time events.

It may be the book of Revelation maintains a strict focus on Israel and the nations who have direct interaction with Israel in the last seven years of history. The absence of direct or explicit references to America in Scripture may indicate the United States will not attack Israel, provide significant support to Israel, or play any role in End-Time battles involving Israel.

Another option is that in the last days, America desires to support Israel, but can’t because of a calamity, economic hardship, poor leadership, or because she has suffered the judgment of God. Romans 1:18-23 notes that the nation who embraces wickedness and opposes or suppresses truth will eventually suffer God’s judgment. Of course, that definition fits many countries, not America exclusively. (See Option 3 for additional information regarding God’s judgment.)

Option 2: America Is The Great Eagle Mentioned in Revelation 12.

The rescuing Eagle noted in Revelation 12:6, 14 aids and protects the Hebrew people in the last days. This idea, however, requires that America provide exceptional support to Israel in the last days—likely at significant risk and cost: transporting, supplying, and protecting several million Jews for 1260 days.

NOTE: Many believe the current political climate makes this option unlikely. In this writer’s view, the following is more likely:

The Eagle in Revelation 12 is linked to God’s supernatural provision (cf. Exodus 19:4).

The land of rescue is not the United States, but rather Petra, in the land of Jordan. Daniel 11:41 notes that this area will not come under the control of the Antichrist.

Option 3: America is the Whore of Babylon in Revelation 13, 17 & 18.

The Whore of Babylon is also called the Daughter of Babylon, or the Woman Who Rides The Beast. Many are quick to dismiss this option, perhaps due to the unflattering description. Though this option may be unlikely, a study of the descriptive phrases the Bible uses to define the attributes of the Daughter of Babylon makes this option worthy of consideration. Compare the descriptions of the Daughter of Babylon to the current condition of American culture and political structure. The nation is described as follows:

She is noted for her architecture, buildings, and skyline (Isaiah 13:22).

She is the lone or newest notable world power (Isaiah 47:5, 8).

She is respected and envied, yet at the same time, hated by the world (Isaiah 18:2).

She has a unique and remarkable beginning (Isaiah 18:2).

She is a “Queen among nations” (Isaiah 47:5, 7; Rev. 17, 18; Isaiah 13:6).

She is called a lady (Isaiah 47:7-9).

She is a land quartered by mighty rivers (Isaiah 18:2).

She destroys her land, with pollution/waste (Isaiah 14:20; 18:2, 7).

She is a democracy—ruled by many counsels (Isaiah 47:13).

Her governmental system will break down (Isaiah 47:13).

She is known for religious confusion (Isaiah 47:12-13).

She is a virgin nation; her lands untouched by foreign invaders (Isaiah 47:1).

Her enemies lie on the other side of the world (Isaiah 13:5).

Her people think they are God’s elect and chosen (Isaiah 47:7-8).

She acts carelessly before the Lord (Isaiah 47:8).

She is proud, haughty, and does not consider her end (Isaiah 47:7-8).

She is the youngest and greatest of the End-Time nations (Jeremiah 50:12).

She is a most powerful nation (Isaiah 47; Jeremiah 50, 51; Revelation 18).

The strength of her armies will make her the “Hammer of the whole earth.” (Jeremiah 50:23; Revelation 18:23).

She is a land rich in minerals (Jeremiah 51:13) and agriculture (Jeremiah 50:16, 26-27, 51; Revelation 18).

She is a leading import/export nation. (Jeremiah 51:13, 51; Revelation 18)

She sits upon “many waters” (Jeremiah 51:13).

She turns on her heritage (Jeremiah 50:11-12).

Her leaders lead their flocks astray (Jeremiah 50:6; implied Revelation 18:2).

She has a mother nation that remains to her death (Jeremiah 50:12).

Her mother has the symbol of the lion (Daniel 7:4; Ezekiel 38:13; Jeremiah 51:38; Psalms 17:12).

She will turn against her own people (Jeremiah 50:7, 33; 51:35; 39; Daniel 7:25; Revelation 13:7; 17:6; 18:24).

She trades with many via ships all year round (Revelation 18:17-18).

Note the Judgments which will befall the nation referenced above:

JEREMIAH 50: “This is the word the Lord spoke through Jeremiah…‘Babylon will be captured… A nation from the north will attack her and lay waste her land….So Babylonia will be plundered; all who plunder her will have their fill…” ‘Take up your positions around Babylon, all you who draw the bow. Shoot at her! Spare no arrows for she has sinned against the Lord. She surrenders, her towers fall. The noise of battle is in the land, the noise of great destruction! How broken and shattered is the hammer of the whole earth! Come against her from afar…”See, I am against you, you arrogant one,’ declares the Lord, the Lord Almighty, ‘for your day has come…’”

JEREMIAH 51: “See, I will stir up the spirit of a destroyer against Babylon and the people of Leb Kamai.” (this name is an athbash – an acronym or code based on numbering Hebrew letters.) The reference here is the equivalent of Chaldea, which Jeremiah 25:26 associates with Babylon. “Babylon was a gold cup in the Lord’s hand…Babylon will suddenly fall and be broken. Wail over her! Get balm for her pain; perhaps she can be healed. The Lord will carry out His purpose…You who live by many waters and are rich in treasures, your end has come…I will surely fill you with troops…and they will shout in triumph over you…”Daughter Babylon is like a threshing floor at the time it is trampled…Babylon will be captured, the boast of the whole earth seized!”

Option 4: America is One of The Young Lions Mentioned in Ezekiel 38.

Ezekiel 38:13 states, “Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions thereof, shall say unto thee, ‘Art thou come to take a spoil? Hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey? To carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take a great spoil?’”

The above passage notes that Sheba, Dedan, and Tarshish resist (or at least question) the vast army of the north that is approaching Israel. The question is, who are the people of Sheba, Dedan, and Tarshish? Several plausible possibilities exist.

Sheba and Dedan are referenced as the sons of Cush (Genesis 10:7). Sheba and Dedan could be a general reference to the people who occupy lands to the east of Israel (Genesis 25:1-6). Tarshish is harder to place. However, most Bible scholars believe it to be among the kingdoms in the west, including the British Isles and Spain. America is a young nation. Its birth has links to both Spain and Britain. Hence, some believe America could be one of Ezekiel’s young lions.

Summary

The goal of this article is not to frighten, but to inform. Through prophecy, God provides warning and insight. God shares so that His people can prepare (mentally, spiritually, materially). Note that the Bible, with a few exceptions, does not direct believers to flee. Rather, believers are directed to take a stand and be a light. Let me encourage all to pray for their nation, and be a witness to their nation. A time of tribulation and judgment is coming. A rapture is coming. Let His people be found faithful and active in Great Commission work when the Lord returns.",http://beforeitsnews.com/prophecy/2018/01/america-in-prophecy-what-the-bible-sas-2496566.html,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

5452,6205,Iran’s Nuclear Weapons Development—No Deal is a Bad Deal,"Subscribe to Canada Free Press for FREE

The only “deal” is a “good” deal. A win/lose situation. Western Civilization wins and the despotic tyrannical regime in Iran loses!

Iran’s Nuclear Weapons Development—No Deal is a Bad Deal

The United States government states, “No deal is better than a “bad” deal.” Actually, no deal is just as bad as a “bad” deal. A “bad” deal leaves Iran with over 19,000 centrifuges spinning towards 90% enrichment. (That is 80% of the work needed to develop a bomb.)

It leaves Iran continuing to develop long range nuclear missile capability. This allows Iran to reach both Western Europe and America. Also within reach of these missiles are our allies in the Middle East. -Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, the U.A.E,and Saudi Arabia. But—no “deal”, the environment in which we are presently negotiating, leaves Iran with all the above capabilities except further enrichment to 90% of fissionable material.

Unfortunately, Iran has not allowed the IAEA to perform on site inspections. This is a serious problem since in 2003 Rouhani, then Iran’s chief negotiator, bragged how he “fooled” the Western Powers as his facilities were being built. A former director of the IAEA stated, “Iran has imported enough carbon fibers to manufacture over 50,000 centrifuges. As of this writing, Iran has not said where the carbon fiber is stored.” Veteran U.S. diplomat Dennis Ross doesn’t believe the Iranians are capable of settling a deal. Seasoned diplomats have publicly stated that Iran seems to be using the North Korea playbook. Namely, continue to talk and delay until you reach a “nuclear sneak out”. Pakistan needed only 6,000 centrifuges to develop their “hidden” nuclear weapons capability. Iran has over 19,000 centrifuges.

The only “deal” that will be beneficial for the U. S. and it’s allies is a “good” deal. MEK, the main opposition group to the Iranian leadership says it well, “Compel the Mullahs to shut down and dismantle their bomb making , enrichment and heavy water programs.” The Washington Post, not considered a “conservative voice, states, “If you want to prevent a nuclear Iran, then you’ve got to have regime change.” Sanctions won’t do it. Iran has already recovered $20 billion of their $100 billion loss due to previous sanctions. Threatening Iran with bombing or destruction does not seem to concern them. Their religious belief (Shiite) , which I respect, states that their twelfth Imam (Arrival of the Kingdom of God) will appear after a “giant” conflagration. The noted historian, Professor Bernard Lewis stated, “mutually assured destruction is not a deterrent , for Iran, it is an inducement.” After regime change, destruction of their nuclear capability, invasive inspections to ensure that they are not cheating and cessation of their support for Hizballah and Hamas, both designated terror organizations by many Western governments, will a better future for Iranians and the Western World be possible. The Iranians have been stating, “Death to America”, since 1979, when they destroyed the American embassy and held Americans hostage for over one year. Please note, that the Iranian supplied IED’s to the militant groups in Iraq, killed more American service personnel than all of Saddam Hussein’s army . The only “deal” is a “good” deal. A win/lose situation. Western Civilization wins and the despotic tyrannical regime in Iran loses!

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

Authored by Michael Snyder via The Economic Collapse blog,

This flu season is already off to a record-setting beginning, and many believe that it could ultimately be the worst that we have seen in decades. In fact, it has been reported that if we stay on this current pace that this could truly be the worst flu season in more than 50 years. As you will see below, the CDC is reporting widespread flu activity from coast to coast, and the death toll has already crossed 100. Here in the United States, flu season usually begins in October and ends in May, and so we still have a long way to go before it is over.

Normally the mainstream media tries very hard to keep the public calm about these things, but even the Washington Post admits that we are having “a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad flu season”…

The nation is having a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad flu season. Flu is widespread in 46 states, according to reports to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nationally, as of mid-December, at least 106 people had died of the infectious disease.

Usually a flu outbreak is centered in one portion of the country, but this one is different. According to the CDC, this outbreak is affecting the entire nation, and the number of cases climbed another 5.8 percent within the past week…

“Flu is everywhere in the US right now,” said Dr. Dan Jernigan, director of the CDC’s influenza branch. “This is the first year we’ve had the entire continental US at the same level (of flu activity) at the same time.” It has been an early flu season that seems to be peaking now, he said, with a 5.8% increase in laboratory-confirmed cases this week over last.

Most people that get the flu don’t die, but it is very important for all of us to understand that this is a very serious outbreak.

In California, things have already gotten so bad that some hospitals have started to run out of Tamiflu…

California has been particularly hard hit, with at least 27 deaths of people under 65 attributed to the flu, according to reports. As the number of cases continues to climb there, hospitals are beginning to run out of Tamiflu, the anti-viral medication used to treat the illness.

If you live in an area where the flu is running rampant, it may be wise to avoid public areas for a while. Unfortunately, the vast majority of us cannot do that. Most Americans have work or school commitments that cannot be avoided, and the flu can often spread very rapidly in those environments.

Back during the bird flu scare a few years ago, some schools actually closed for a time, and we are starting to see that happen again. For example, one school down in Texas had a “flu day” on Friday…

A school in San Antonio will be closed Friday for a “flu day” amid an outbreak of influenza. “While closed, our school will be launching a Super Clean of each classroom for the health of our faculty, staff and students,” San Antonio Christian School posted on Facebook. Texas has been especially hard-hit by the flu this season, topping Walgreens’ Flu Index, which compiles data from prescriptions used to treat the virus’ symptoms.

Every year the authorities relentlessly promote the flu shot, but large numbers of people that got the flu shot this year are getting sick anyway.

Sadly, the flu shot is not likely to protect you from the very powerful strains of the flu that are dominant this flu season. In fact, the experts are telling us that the flu shot was only “around 10 percent” effective during the flu season in Australia this year…

U.S. flu specialists say they won’t completely know how powerful this present season’s antibody is until the point that the season is finished. In any case, Australia’s experience recommends viability was just around 10 percent. In the United States, it is 40 to 60 percent powerful in a normal season. Immunizations are less defensive if strains are not the same as anticipated and if sudden transformations happen.

Hopefully everyone out there is stocking up on Vitamin C and echinacea. We still have more than two months of winter left, and the spread of the flu appears to be accelerating.

If you do get sick, please stay home and don’t expose others. Many of us like to try to battle through an illness, and in the process we can inadvertently share it with others.

Eventually this flu epidemic will pass, but for now we need to be smart as we weather this storm.

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

wolfstreet.com / by Michael Gorback, M.D. / Dec 25, 2017

“I’ve been pounding the table about location-based pricing for years. Now we have hard data.”

Wolf here: Michael Gorback, M.D., who has authored a number of articles for Wolf Street on how opaque pricing in the US healthcare system inflates costs, has been a strong advocate of price transparency. He told me he is “one of the very few (only?) pain specialists who accept uninsured patients and publish their cash fee schedule.”

A “cash fee schedule” is essentially a price list. It’s the norm in just about every industry, except in healthcare, where opaque pricing dominates – to the detriment of consumers.

By Michael Gorback, M.D., at the Center for Pain Relief in Houston, TX:

Imagine you’re out shopping for a new car. You stop by Dealership A and get an offer of $35,000. You decide to do some comparison-shopping and head over to Dealership B. Their price is $39,000. You show them the offer from Dealership A. The trusty salesman says you should buy the car from him at the higher price because his store has a higher overhead. “Look at the fancy furniture in our showroom,” he says. “The chairs are really comfortable in the waiting area and we offer espresso and cappuccino. Our rent is also much higher.”

This is the logic behind higher prices for outpatient procedures done at a hospital as opposed to an ambulatory surgery center or office setting. I discussed this phenomenon on Wolf Street back in 2014.

Killing America With Kindness

The Humanitarian Hoax of DACA



The Humanitarian Hoax is a deliberate and deceitful tactic of presenting a destructive policy as altruistic. The humanitarian huckster presents himself as a compassionate advocate when in fact he is the disguised enemy. Obama, the humanitarian huckster-in-chief, weakened the United States for eight years presenting his crippling Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) advocacy as altruistic when in fact it was designed for destruction. His legacy, the Leftist Democrat Party with its ongoing Resistance movement, is the party of the Humanitarian Hoax attempting to destroy the capitalist infrastructure of American democracy through deceitful immigration reforms. This is how it works.

Rebranding is a marketing tool used by advertisers to sell products that don’t sell. Rebranding changes the name but it does not change the product DACA Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals was the 2012 product of Obama’s illegal executive overreach. The lesser known DAPA Deferred Action for Parents of Americans was Obama’s 2014 expansion program that legalized illegal alien parents whose children became legal American citizens through birthright citizenship. Amnesty programs for illegal immigrants guaranteed Democrat votes but Obama had a problem selling the idea to Congress even though Democrats had control of both Houses. Illegal aliens needed a new image. No problem for Obama - his Leftist image-makers went to work. Soon illegal aliens became undocumented aliens, then undocumented workers, then unauthorized immigrants, then undocumented immigrants, and finally the loftiest brand of them all - Dreamers. Obama’s rebranded illegal aliens were transformed into Dreamers and protecting them was merchandised as the humanitarian imperative for America. Millennials signed on in droves but here is the problem. Rebranding is a marketing tool used by advertisers to sell products that don’t sell. Rebranding changes the name but it does not change the product. Dreamers are still illegal aliens. So why would Obama resort to executive overreach to sell rebranded illegal immigration?? Because Obama needed the positive image of Dreamers to sell DACA and DAPA as altruistic programs when they were actually deceitful Democrat power-grabs designed to tip red states blue. It was always about the votes. USA Today reports that according to Migration Policy Institute there are 3.6 million Dreamers living in the U.S. today - not the oft-repeated 800,000. “The 3.6 million estimate of undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. before their 18th birthday comes from the Migration Policy Institute, a non-partisan, non-profit think tank that studies global immigration patterns. That is roughly a third of all undocumented immigrants in the country and does not include millions of their immediate family members who are U.S. citizens.”

Millions of illegal immigrants awarded amnesty will vote to elect a Democrat President who will open the borders and flood the country with more immigrants The Democrat narrative is that deportations of illegal aliens would be amoral and an economic calamity. The reality is that under-educated non-working unauthorized immigrants whether they are Dreamers or not drain the economy instead of improving it. The undisclosed underbelly of the Leftist narrative is that most illegal aliens living in Republican states if awarded amnesty would vote Democrat and tilt red states to blue. If amnesty and chain migration pass, the additional Democrat votes would put several red states in play particularly Florida, Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina. Michael Cutler warns us about the consequences of DACA to national security and argues that DACA is the Immigration Trojan Horse. Cutler contends that, “The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) created a massive amnesty program that ultimately led to the greatest influx of illegal aliens in the history of our nation. It has been said that insanity is doing the same things the same way and expecting a different outcome.” So it is with DACA. Millions of illegal immigrants awarded amnesty will vote to elect a Democrat President who will open the borders and flood the country with more immigrants who will be granted voting rights and will vote Democrat. This chain will accomplish the Leftist goal to destroy our constitutional republic and replace it with socialism. The United States of America is the greatest experiment in individual freedom and upward mobility the world has ever known. Protection of our republic is the essence of President Trump’s America-first policies. President Trump revoked DAPA in June 2017 and ended DACA in September 2017 saying “The legislative, not the executive branch writes these [immigration] laws.” Yet DACA continues to be discussed and marketed to a trusting public by Obama’s Resistance movement as the altruistic responsibility of compassionate American citizens. For 241 years America has said NO to monarchies, NO to oligarchies, NO to totalitarianism, NO to authoritarianism, and NO to illegal immigration. We are a country of LEGAL immigrants not a country of illegal immigrants. We have fought to preserve our constitutional republic with its checks and balances on power codified in our Constitution to protect our individual rights and way of life. Socialism is the great leftist scam being perpetrated on the American people and implemented through destructive leftist immigration policies.

Continued below... We cannot allow DACA Dreamers to tilt America toward leftist socialism Millennials have no idea what socialism is in practice. Socialism is most definitely not the Bernie Sanders fantasy of free stuff or the John Lennon song “Imagine” that they are being indoctrinated with. Socialism is an infantilizing political structure in which there is no private property and the government owns all means of production. Citizens are wards of the state and subject to the whims of the government. The government tells its dependent subjects what they can have and how much they can have. There is no freedom or upward mobility in socialism because there is no private ownership. There is only the ruling elite and the enslaved population who serve them. The American dream is dead in socialism. Unrestricted immigration particularly Dreamers and chain migration will ultimately transform America the beautiful into a socialist state. The American dream will be sacrificed to DACA Dreamers. Why? The answer is that socialism is the prerequisite political infrastructure to internationalize sovereign countries in preparation for one-world government. Globalism’s one-world government is the hidden motive for the Leftist Democrat policies that endorse the humanitarian hoax of DACA and chain migration. Socialism is deceitfully marketed as the great equalizer - the social system that will provide social justice and income equality. Socialism is the big lie of the 21st century because in reality socialism only benefits the elitists who rule the country. All anyone has to do is look at Cuba and Venezuela where the rulers live like kings and the ruled suffer shortages, deprivation, and poverty. We cannot allow DACA Dreamers to tilt America toward leftist socialism which robs all Americans of their liberty except the elitists in power. Choosing the Dreamer’s dreams over the American dream is a lethal choice that will end our constitutional republic - but that was always the point of the humanitarian hoax of DACA - to kill America with “kindness.”

8515,9638,Are Liberals trying to Annoy Us?,"Republicans need to recognize an important fact: Liberalism is not driven by any real political philosophy but by resentment, bitterness, and anger toward mainstream society. Conservatives keep trying to patiently and politely point out where Democrat candidates are factually and logically wrong.

The Left irritates society with ever-more loony ideas. Conservatives think they can reason with liberals. But crazy is their goal, because liberals are trying to annoy people on purpose. Upsetting the mainstream is a way of expressing anger and bitterness. So reasoning with liberals is exactly what they don’t want. They want to make you upset. Conservatives are trying to argue logic to a teenage boy who is bitter and angry at his parents. Liberalism is like a teenage girl who really wants to annoy her parents by dating a 30 year old covered in tattoos from a biker gang. Liberal “complaints” are actually proxies substituting for other issues.

That cannot work because liberalism is not about facts or logic. You can’t explain the Democrat Party (which liberals took over starting in 1968). What is happening to our country is not about issues. (But, a clarification: I am focusing here on liberal activists and leaders. Many ordinary individuals are just caught up in their rhetoric.)

Similarly, whatever mainstream society admires, enjoys or takes pleasure in liberals are determined to tear down, attack, and smear. If you are happy, liberals must put a stop to that. Misery loves company. Liberals are unhappy. They “need” to prove that what most people enjoy and admire is actually bad or evil. Mainstream society is happy only because we are ignorant. If only we were as enlightened as liberals, we would be miserable along with them. The Left is convinced that societal happiness comes at the expense of harmful side effects that we are ignoring.

America’s Founding Fathers used to be admired

America’s Founding Fathers used to be admired. So to express anger at the country, the liberals in the U.S.A. must tear down whatever the culture admires, and prove what awful people the Founding Fathers truly were. The U.S.A. has prospered with the automobile. So liberals have to despise the car culture and tear it down.

Americans love their country

Americans love their country. So for decades liberals have been trying to convince everyone how horrible our nation is and the ugly side of its history. Because this indoctrination is concentrated in the schools, adults don’t always realize how severe this anti-American drumbeat has been behind the closed classroom door.

Americans honored their military

Americans honored their military. So the Left had to tear down and smear those who serve in the armed forces as monsters and baby killers. I recently interviewed Hollywood film-maker Jack Marino on the radio. Marino created a Vietnam War movie showing U.S. soldiers in a positive light. The movie “Forgotten Heroes” is complete, but because it has a positive spin, he can’t get it distributed to movie theaters and has been black-balled in Hollywood.

If the goal were to change policies about war, liberals would attack national leaders who actually make the decisions to go to war. Why the nastiness towards our boys in uniform since the 1960’s? The Leftist goal is not a new national strategy. The goal is tearing down whatever most Americans cherish. The only reason to attack the soldiers is out of general hatred for the country, to prove that society as a whole is wrong and they are right.

Marriage and the nuclear family were once admired greatly

Marriage and the nuclear family were once admired greatly. So the Left has spent decades tearing them down. Men are dumb, and wife-beaters too. Children unloved and neglected. Men attracted sexually to children are rare, yet somehow to hear liberals and divorce lawyers tell it sexual abuse in families is almost universal. Such nonsense makes sense only to those who want to attack what other people cherish.

Recently, football is under attack. People like football. So those who want to express their anger at society can’t resist attacking whatever the majority of the population enjoys and likes. They tell us movie popcorn is unhealthy, because most people like movie popcorn. (Popcorn is just corn. Butter is simply milk.)

America’s industrial might has contributed greatly to the wealth of the world

America’s industrial might has contributed greatly to the wealth of the world. American capitalism has made the poor in the U.S. richer than most kings and queens of human history. What king of old ever had a cell phone, a microwave oven, DVD player with movies on demand, indoor plumbing, or just soft toilet paper? Yet liberals have to convince us that what we thought was good is actually bad.

Last Fall, California passed a law that students may choose the bathroom, locker room, showers, and sports team of their choice in public schools. Presumably, government swimming pools must also allow a boy to change into a bathing suit and shower along with the girls, so they are completely naked together.

The law is triggered by only a student’s self-declaration. So the temptation for a teenage boy to watch teenage girls shower or undress is obvious to anyone except a liberal. An article in The New York Times reports that this movement believes that young people’s self-perception of gender can change from day to day. One student told the Times: “Some days I wake up and think, ‘Why am I in this body?’ Most days I wake up and think, ‘What was I thinking yesterday?’” Of course such emotional upheaval used to be called puberty. Always at war with reality, liberals convert a normal part of growing up into a societal problem.

So why aren’t liberals laughed out of politics in America? How can such lunacy survive?

Conservatives think that liberals are fundamentally the same but with different tastes. One person prefers strawberry ice cream and another person prefers chocolate. But liberals fundamentally think, process information, and view the world totally differently. So, conservatives fail at responding to liberal attacks. Liberals may even be unaware of their own motivation consciously.

Yet the lunacy of the Left is endless, because it is deliberate. The Left is not driven by any other logic than trying to prove that our cultural consensus is wrong. If liberals get what they say they want, they will only dream up an endless supply of new complaints and grievances. Trying to reason with liberals or address their complaints can never work. The conviction that whatever most people believe has to be wrong and only liberals see the truth is at the core of leftist politics.",http://canadafreepress.com/print_friendly/are-liberals-trying-to-annoy-us,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

If we can just get a hold of Jesus (and not another list of man-made rules and regulations), He will personally make sure everything else is just as it needs to be. All we need is Jesus

‘All we need is Jesus’, A Belated Christmas Story



This holiday season I was especially looking forward to Christmas, much due to the yearly reminder of the unconditional love and blessings that I need so badly and that I’ve been given in Jesus - coupled with the reunion of my beloved family members. It had been an extremely rough year for me. And I was looking to hide from some of my grief by just celebrating God’s unfailing love in the company of my beloved, visiting Christian children. My (now grown) babies are great gifts of unconditional love from my Heavenly Father. And they are this old man’s joy in the face of even life’s darkest moments. As we prepared for the day, my wife sneaked down to the basement to get our Nativity scene. I love the reminder of Jesus’ birth that I’ve seen traditionally since I was a boy. And she knew that my seeing that all set up would brighten my day. Just as I realized she was missing, I heard a loud crash from beneath our living room floor. A few minutes after that, she reappeared and sadly told me that our beautiful, classic Nativity pieces were destroyed - all but the baby Jesus. She had dropped the box containing the fine porcelain figures , and its contents were shattered. I used that moment’s last bit of strength to assure her that it was ‘no big deal’. Nevertheless we were both really disappointed.

With only a few days left until Christmas, I searched the Internet for a decent replacement set. But nothing comparable to the quality of what we had lost was touchable for less than a third of the national debt. And what was suitable and still affordable would never have reached here in time. Feeling some shame for my self-pity in the face of the real problems I knew other people were enduring, I told God I would be happy to spend the holiday with an otherwise empty wooden manger housing only a cradle with the effigy of His baby son. What a ‘big sacrifice’ on my part, I thought. Nevertheless I was bummed all the same. The next day my wife set out shopping locally for a replacement Creche or at least the figurines needed to repopulate the holy crowd around our lone, ‘surviving’ infant Savior. She found nothing ... until her last stop in a secondhand store. The woman said to her, “We do have one remaining bunch of Nativity figures - and very nice ones at that - but there is one big disqualifying problem. I’m sure you won’t want them.” She walked her to the back of the store and picked up a plastic bag filled with the beautiful little statuary - Joseph, Mary, the shepherds, the three wise men, some livestock. All the characters were pristine and even perfectly matched our old set. “But,” the woman sadly noted, ” ... It’s missing the most important piece! There is no baby Jesus!” My wife looked at the woman and said, “Well, what do you know! God laid these aside just for us!” And then she took the opportunity to rehearse our little dilemma to the woman as she paid her the five bucks they were asking for the crucially ‘incomplete’ set of Nativity figures. And in that tiny story’s happy solution - which that kind saleslady had very much helped to remedy - God was entirely glorified. The reason that I had to share this story with you, my good readers, is because that is the sort of relationship I have with the mighty God who made us all. He performs these ‘miracles’ - large and small - in my life and the lives of all my family in Christ, regularly and without hesitation. Truly, it is a portion of His ‘part’ in the ongoing conversation that never ceases between Him and His people. In my relationship with Christ, besides His saving my eternal soul, He has daily loaded me up with all sorts of benefits - from saving my physical life several times, to taking bountiful care of even the smallest details of the comparatively insignificant stuff that matters to me and to people who don’t even believe He exists. But His answers to my prayers alone amount to enough material to inspire several books.

One of the things that so frustrates me in this world is how so many (though not all) of the organizations that have set themselves up as God’s representatives, the various church outfits, have made Him so inaccessible. From the bottom of my heart, I don’t believe that God ever intended knowing Him to be as difficult as the devil and so much of the organized church has made it appear. And in explaining why I feel as I do, the following is a real brief ‘theology’ lesson that I hope you will benefit from knowing. If you can spare a few minutes, this might help in understanding the ‘religion’ that I see that God is really all about … God made man and woman, and gave them the total freedom to choose Him or their own way. Just as you can’t force anyone to love you in this life, neither does God try to force anyone to love Him: God didn’t make us robots. He created free-willed mankind as the pinnacle of his creation. And when He did that, it infuriated a self-consumed, former archangel named Lucifer (who had already convinced himself that he was the pinnacle of all things). The moment his rebellion materialized, Lucifer (now aka the devil) was banished from heaven and cast down to earth, along with his rebellious angelic following. God has allowed him to reside here on earth and tempt mankind, in order to give us the opportunity to freely choose either our loving Creator or to join satan in our own selfish anarchy. Our perfect and sinless ‘prototype’ great great great great great … grandparents, Adam and Eve, sadly chose to join that rebellion and subsequently separated mankind from God whom they had disobeyed. And so the rest of us were born in that exile - infected, if you will, with that predisposition. But God, not willing that any of us should perish, sacrificed his own Son to bring us - all who freely want to come - back to Him. Tragically, so many Christians and churches don’t seem to want to teach you much of the above. But, even more tragically, they don’t appear interested in responsibly introducing people to the simple but HUGE differences between the Old and New Testaments in the Bible that tells us all about God. The Bible is pretty simple to understand, really, to anyone who is sincerely interested in discovering its messages. Having even a rudimentary knowledge of Scripture is very important since it can clear up a whole lot of mystery, especially for a lot of 21st century people who no longer take the time to do any homework or even much thinking for themselves.

Continued below... THEREFORE COMMIT AT LEAST THE FOLLOWING TWO POINTS TO MEMORY!

(1.) The Old Testament was lived out and written as God’s way of teaching fallen mankind about Himself and just how far and completely fatally we had fallen away from Him. Many of the Old Testament’s strict laws that make absolutely no sense to most of the world today - and the horrible consequences for breaking them - were God’s way of driving home our imperfection and THE IMPOSSIBILITY of even our best attempts at measuring up to His perfection or EVER earning His love. The penalty of death to serious lawbreakers and the sacrificing of innocent, living animals to cover certain sins was God’s painful way of showing us that sin (rebellion against God) is fatal in every respect. The devil has even used the Old Testament’s untempered severity as a way of portraying God as just a big mean tyrant with an appetite to condemn people when they mess up. And such a portrayal has been allowed to stand for thousands of years - because satan doesn’t want the whole story to be told. IN FACT, THE OLD TESTAMENT WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE A DESTINATION BUT RATHER AN ILLUSTRATIVE ROUTE TO THE GRACE OF GOD IN HIS SON, JESUS CHRIST. (See for example, Isaiah 53 - and think about Jesus while you are reading that.)



(2.) The New Testament (which completed all of the legal demands of the Old Testament) is our same VERY HOLY God’s introducing us to the fact (and GREAT NEWS) THAT HE, THROUGH HIS SON, KEPT ALL THE LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE OLD TESTAMENT, PERFECTLY - FOR US! Before He ever created totally free-willed men and women, God (who lives outside of time) knew in advance that we would need saving. So Jesus, who was actually then called the ‘Word of God’, became one of us (that’s how much He loved us), and lived and died in order to save us all from being destroyed and punished. [NOTE: Today, in an unbelieving world, we have lost nearly all understanding of grace and common sense, and many of us are no longer parented in the tutelage of God’s authority, His Lordship and His absolute right to expect certain things from His creation. The whole idea of our needing a Savior makes no sense at all to biblically-ignorant people. Add to that mindset the efforts of the real, aforementioned devil who works 24/7 (currently using pseudoscience, fake news and the most technologically advanced communication and entertainment venues to spread his lies) in order to discredit that tiny voice inside us known as our conscience. It is little wonder that so many people are today cynical regarding the life and work of Jesus. And it is therefore also completely logical that our world today is so insanely out-of-control and in the complete mess that it is.]

The above information is, I think, the very least that every human should be aware of when we begin to more closely examine our relationship with our Creator and discover exactly what He wants for and from each of us. Most people today see the Bible as just a big, black, mysterious and sometimes comical or scary book of ancient, superstitious folklore. And often none of God’s words - thanks to a devil-driven media/entertainment industry, churches who aren’t doing their jobs, and lazy and/or fearful uninformed Christians - are given any serious consideration until people are, one-by-one, faced with the fact of our inescapable mortality. And by the way, my good readers, no amount of entertainment or distraction will avert or forestall the date each of us has with death. But the reason I started this story in the first place is because God has (to no credit of my own) brought me into a relationship with Him that amounts to a continual conversation. When my wife came home with exactly the Nativity pieces we needed, it was just one more in a daily series of moment-to-moment concerns that my LOVING Heavenly Father takes the time and trouble to address and remedy. He is not my ‘genie in the sky’. No, there are lots of things that I agonize over and through. And He is fatherly enough not to jump in and do everything for me. A lot of times He wants me to grow up enough that I stop making hasty decisions that can mature into full-blown disasters. And He wants me to learn not to replicate my mistakes. Nevertheless, when I start relating stories like our little Nativity miracle, I am always amazed at the number of people I speak with who don’t experience the same sort of daily happenings in their own lives, or who are oblivious to them. And it’s mostly because they either don’t believe in God. Or, if they do believe in His existence, they don’t have a nodding acquaintance with His personality. God does have feelings. And He does have a very distinct and breathtakingly beautiful personality. And that fact right there is where so many churches and so many uninformed Christians seem to be dropping the ball. And in that ignorance (or, in some instances, perhaps deliberate deception) they’re doing God and mankind a most tragic disservice. Bear with me … When Jesus died on the cross, when He had surrendered His Spirit to His Father and perished, immediately the huge, thick curtain protecting the most holy altar of all, in the Temple in Jerusalem, was ripped in half, right down the middle - by God Himself! Imagine a giant, heavy-duty carpet, about 4 inches thick - weighing in tonnage - being ripped completely in half without the help of the 300 priests it took to carry it! That curtain was kept in place in order to keep anyone except the most high priest out of God’s holiest place on earth. If you wanted to get close to God without dying from the experience, you had to do that through priests. But the Joe Average pedestrian ‘churchgoer’ of the Old Testament couldn’t just go to that altar, a mountaintop or even a church pew and strike up a conversation with God.

Continued below... God ripped open that curtain, or ‘veil’, because He wanted to finally get the priests out of the way! God ‘rent the curtain in twain’ because He could not wait for all His newly adopted children (adopted through their faith in His Son Jesus’ sacrifice) to get at Him, and He at them! But so much of the history of the Christian churches is cluttered with a priesthood/pastorate that is so obviously insistent upon restoring the veil between God and man! Some churches have, for example, throughout the Christian era, actually discouraged independent Bible reading. Also, organized religion has often imposed all sorts of burdens upon its adherents, and used their innocence and gullibility as simply a way into their pocketbooks. The list of abuses of the churches upon the masses is endless, as most people can easily see. For centuries the altars of churches were even hidden by a “Rood Screen,” a lattice or curtain that was most probably taken from Judaism’s placing of the veil/curtain between the chancel and the nave - specifically it was placed between the clergy and the ‘common folk’. It certainly imposed an air of mystery, as most of the service/mass/communion was only barely witnessed by the Bible-ignorant attendants. Instead of participating in real, heartfelt worship, the groundlings were only allowed to hear the sound of bells, smell the incense, and listen to an unintelligible Latin liturgy. The estranged congregants were not at all welcomed into closer fellowship with God. And the clergy will still today often ‘hide’ behind robes and well tailored suits in their big business institutions. Effectively they still keep a “Rood Screen” between themselves and sheep-like followers who are starving for true spiritual revival. So much could be said about how badly a largely self-serving, organized religion has failed in the job they claim to have. Instead of shepherding a dying world back to the One who made us all, they perform shows and fight to protect their positions of power, wealth and authority. And God, unlike His adversary, will not seduce anyone into a relationship. Instead, He is every moment and by all means powerfully convicting the world of sin, judgment and of righteousness - just as He said He would (John 16:8). He has completely opened the way, through Jesus, for ANYONE to easily find Him and know Him intimately! In the Old Testament He showed us His unattainable holiness. And, then, in the New Testament, He solved every problem that our fall had earned us. Jesus kept all the requirements necessary to find our way back to Him! And all in the world He requires from us is that we obediently believe, simply trust in Him, because He knows best. Indeed - so simple, any child can do it! But the truth that isn’t being shouted loud enough is that God sent his only beloved little boy to be born in a cattle shed so everybody could have access to Him. The giant, unbelievably formidable God who built us and every bit of the world and universe - time and space we dwell in - always had it in mind to provide a way back for us after our inevitable fall. And, once we place our trust in his Savior/Son, Jesus Christ ... the huge, holy and formerly unknowable God who used to be our judge suddenly becomes our daddy! And that is where I have found myself. I am not clever enough to discover some deep secret Bible code that isn’t shown to everyone. But I won’t wait for some robed priest, pope or preacher to dictate the methods or parameters of my relationship with the good Lord, the author and administrator of all life. The God who indeed restored our little Nativity set to us has in like manner: restored my legs to me after paralysis, my heart after its total failure, and He has given me so much more than I could have ever imagined. I have many years of memories of miracles He has performed in my life in the process of the conversation we started back when I first met Him. The loud message He gave to me this year at Christmastime was that, again, all I need is Jesus. And He, because He knows everything, will faithfully provide everything else I need in this life and the next. And that is the sort of Christmas the whole world needs right now. If we can just get a hold of Jesus (and not another list of man-made rules and regulations), He will personally make sure everything else is just as it needs to be. All we need is Jesus.

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

By Greg Hunter’s USAWatchdog.com

Geoengineering researcher Dane Wigington says recent Senate hearings confirming the science of geoengineering means dangerous climate changes are underway. Wigington says, “They have to control the message, and notice they always use the term ‘chemtrails’ because that term always leads to a dead end. It’s not a scientific term, and they want us to use that term. You don’t see them using the geoengineering, climate engineering, solar radiation management and aerosol injection term because they don’t want people to understand this issue is real. Why the Senate hearings? Because the elephant in the room is almost impossible to hide, and they are trying to pacify populations until the last possible moment. They want to tell the population what they want to hear–that this is only a proposal. They are saying this must start immediately when this has been going on for 70 years . . . this is the Orwellian world we live in. We have massive toxic aerosol, heavy metal spraying in our atmosphere that could not be more visible. It’s blotting out the sun. . . . These programs are completely out of control. . . .We are on the road to planetary omnicide. Climate engineering is the greatest and most immediate assault we face. Climate engineering, look at this like the pharmaceutical approach to planet earth. Hide the symptoms even if you are making the overall situation exponentially worse. That’s what they are doing. We have had these radical whiplash weather scenarios where it goes from 80 to 90 degrees to snow in a day or two. This weather whiplash is not natural in any way, shape or form.”

Wigington contends that the situation is much worse than anyone thinks, and it’s mainly because of climate engineering. Wigington explains, “Our situation is far, far dire and immediate than anyone comprehends, and climate engineering is making it worse not better. Official statistics say 20 million people could starve in the coming months, and that number will increase radically and exponentially. The biosystems of the planet are imploding.”

Wigington is suing to get NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmosphere Administration) to give up its climate engineering information and has hit a brick wall. Wigington contends, “There is no hiding from what’s coming. . . . NOAA is not returning our FOIA’s, Freedom of Information Act requests. They are legally required to give those to our attorneys, and they are not doing that. In fact, NOAA, in essence, flipped us the middle finger by sending back FOIA’s saying they know nothing about any sort of weather modification anywhere ever. Think how absurd this is when there are 300 regional weather modification programs that NOAA is required to sign off on every single year. They are denying all of it. This is the biggest cover-up in human history, with the largest most extensive operation in history, with the cooperation of governments around the globe. That is not speculation. You have to look and understand the gravity of the situation that is unfolding. Countries around the globe, whatever you are focused on, if it’s not saving the life support systems of the planet, everything else amounts to arranging deck chairs on the Titanic. . . . This is the single most destructive endeavor ever launched by the human race. Mathematically, it’s the greatest threat we face short of nuclear catastrophe.”

Silver Doctors

SD Midweek Update: The markets are mispriced right now with some assets moving in-step when they should not be doing so. Here’s an update…

We have a nice pop in the pre-market today, Wednesday Oct 25th:

There’s good volume on that price rise too.

Since opening on Sunday night, the silver price is down slightly:

As is the gold price:

Of course, we could see this coming from as early as Friday, so we have been in defensive posture anyway. But on the fundamental side of the equation, as the days go on, the fundamentals are going to become harder and harder to ignore.

The infamous “Trump Dossier” is back in the spotlight, and it has Hillary, the DNC, and the FBI’s fingerprints all over it. Then there’s Emperor XI and an oil for gold-backed yuan story that just won’t die. There’s continuing geo-political risk in Iraq, Syria, and North Korea, and Europe is still a basket case.

And that’s just politics.

As far as the stock market goes, well, that’s the Fed’s Frankenstein, and it’s not going to put it down if it doesn’t have to.

And so we have another record high just yesterday:

Of course, our President “Mr Big Fat Ugly Bubble Turned Pump-N-Dumper” Trump was right on cue:

Twitter Ads info and privacy

Which may also give an explanation for this:

Although it doesn’t explain this:

The VIX (the “Fear” barometer) is slowly but surely waking up, which goes against a sell-off in bonds and a rise in the stock market. However, it is so low as it is, that it may take a lot more for than a couple points of action on the VIX to have an effect on the markets.

Furthermore, a rising VIX would also translate into higher gold and silver prices reacting on an increase in “fear”. It just goes to show how the central banks and governments around the world are in these markets 24/7, because when one takes all the individual components as a whole, it just doesn’t add up.

Though the dollar is not benefiting from the increase in fear:

Which goes to show that the dollar is not the safe haven it once was. Also, that’s a bearish engulfing candle forming on the daily. We had speculated that the dollar could get all the way up to 96 based on the chart patterns, but over the last few days, it looks to be running out of steam at 94. Once the dollar continues the move lower, that will also help to boost the prices of gold & silver.

But then again, neither is Bitcoin:

Which brings up the next point to this midweek update: Nearly the price of everything is mispriced. Granted, that’s why there have been titles about the “everything” bubble.

Crude is starting to look over-extended in the most recent price rise:

The ascent is getting steeper and steeper. Of particular interest is the rise in the price of oil alongside the rise in strength of the dollar. Generally, a higher dollar means lower crude prices, and a lower dollar means higher crude prices. Not over the last couple of weeks, however.

Although copper still looks healthy:

Copper built the multi-day base between $3.10 and $3.15 before retreating, although putting in a higher-low. The base metal now appears to be base-forming again from the next step up, between $3.15 and $3.20, although an argument could even be made that the base could be all the way up to $3.20 to $3.25. An increase in the copper price will raise the floor for silver as silver trades in it’s “industrial metal” role.

Platinum is not looking like it is has braced in a defensive posture, however:

If platinum can hold here, it will have put in the all important higher-low, but those down days are nasty. We’ll see by the end of the week if the set up was bullish or bearish.

Although it is looking bullish in palladium for two reasons:

Palladium has formed both a rounded bottom on the daily, and there is a nice symmetrical cup-n-handle forming, which would also be bullish.

There are a number of data releases coming out between now and the end of the week. there are several market moving releases left including:

Durable Goods Orders

New Home Sales

EIA Petroleum Status Report

Trade Balance (Deficit)

Jobless Claims

Pending Home Sales

And then the big one is released on Friday: First Estimate of Third Quarter GDP. As of the time of this Midweek Update, the Atlanta and NY Fed have not updated their forecasts, though those updates will be coming out later this morning.

We have been weathering the storm well. The question is this: Has the storm passed, or are we merely in the eye of the storm?

We’ll know by Friday, but sudden moves coming from pent-up energy should not be removed from the realm of possibility. All it takes is one match to the many barrels of fundamental news gunpowder and we could be thrown in the midst of another precious metals surge that catches everybody off guard.

7891,8957,Time to REBEL! 5 Ways We Can Break the Big Banks' Death Grip on the Economy,"Time to REBEL! 5 Ways We Can Break the Big Banks' Death Grip on the Economy

Photo Credit: Lily Rothrock via Flickr

Let’s be honest. Many people are feeling a little hopeless and cynical about whether anything can change how Wall Street banks run roughshod over the economy and our democracy. We’ve marched, rallied, sat-in and thousands have been arrested--and yet bankers have remained unrepentant, unpunished, unindicted and seemingly untouchable. But the wheels of history are turning and Wall Street’s incredible greed and arrogance may have finally handed us the tools and leverage we need to challenge and break the death grip Wall Street has on struggling people and communities around the country.

Two critical tools--the LIBOR fraud scandal and the potential to start exercising eminent domain to seize bank-owned properties--can supercharge the ongoing campaigns focused on Wall Street. For the first time we can align moral and legal arguments with real leverage to demand that banks renegotiate the debt that is bankrupting communities and drowning homeowners around the country. The single most important step we can take to address local budget deficits is to force banks to renegotiate toxic deals held by local government and to rewrite mortgages for underwater homeowners. Combined, this would pump hundreds of billions into local economies.

First some definitions:

The LIBOR fraud scandalmay seem confusing, but it is really pretty simple. Over $800 trillion in loans, derivatives and other financial deals are based on LIBOR (the London Interbank Offered Rate). The banks fixed the rate to increase their profits at our expense and now everyone all over the world is trying to figure out how much it has cost the rest of us.

Whatever the ultimate number is (there are estimates of hundreds of billions in damages), this scandal has permanently torpedoed the notion that there is “moral hazard” in debt relief for regular folks. We can now prove what we’ve always suspected--that the big banks have rigged the game in their favor and that our deals with them are inherently unfair and should be renegotiated. Oakland, California has taken a first step by demanding Goldman Sachs renegotiate a toxic swap the city is trapped in, saying it will boycott Goldman Sachs in the future if the bank won’t renegotiate.

Eminent Domain. Government has long seized property to create room to build shopping malls and stadiums. Those same laws can be used to seize underwater mortgages from banks and then rewrite them at their real value so homeowners can stay in their homes at greatly reduced mortgage costs. If banks are unwilling to reset mortgages at fair market value, then local governments can lawfully seize their property for the common economic good. They would merely have to pay the banks fair market value for the mortgages, which would force the banks to take significant writedowns. San Bernardino County and Berkeley , California have already started down this road .

It is time to REBEL, against Wall Street and the big banks and to start fixing the economy and reclaim our democracy. There are five steps to this:

1. Renegotiate public and housing debt. We need to lift up the demand loud and clear that we want to renegotiate public debt and that it is unfair and illegal to hold local governments and public services hostage to Wall Street’s toxic loans. It is estimated that banks have already sucked more than $50 billion out of local communities through toxic loans, fees and tricky deals that cities are locked into.

2. Exercise eminent domain. There are 16 million underwater homes, worth $2.8 trillion, that are $1.2 trillion underwater. Resetting those mortgages to fair market value would save the average underwater homeowner $543 per month, pumping $104 billion into the national economy every year. This would create 1.5 million jobs nationally.* If just five of the most severely underwater cities used eminent domain they could seize $140 billion worth of underwater homes from banks, forcing banks to take a $30 billion haircut on underwater loans.

3. Boycott big banks and move public money. One of the key profit centers for banks is their government business. And it isn’t just LIBOR they cheated on. There are investigations and growing scandals around price fixing on municipal bonds as well. Furthermore, banks are holding cities hostage on Letters of Credit (LOC’s) by ratcheting up the cost knowing if cities refuse to pay they may be forced to pay huge termination fees. If increasing numbers of cities, pension funds and other holders of public capital chose to boycott certain big banks and moved money out of those banks, it could be a huge financial hit for them.

4. Enact resolutions at local governments and pension funds. There is a simple way to get started that will send chills down Wall Street banks’ spines. Let’s start moving resolutions in cities and counties big and small around the country, demanding that local government and pension funds explore suing banks over LIBOR and prepare to use eminent domain to seize underwater mortgages from banks if they won’t renegotiate debt. This sample resolution is a first step in raising the issue locally and starting to build a campaign to force local governments to hold Wall Street accountable.

5. Litigate and legislate. But it isn’t enough just to pass resolutions--that is only a first step. If the banks refuse to renegotiate the debt than we need to litigate and legislate in our local communities. Our pension funds need to sue to recoup their losses. Local government needs to sue to get out of bad deals and claw back money banks unfairly made off of local taxpayers. And we need to follow the lead of Oakland, Los Angeles and other cities that have passed laws saying they will divest from banks that engage in unfair banking practices.

Since the financial crisis hit in 2008, community groups like National People’s Action, ACCE, New York Communities for Change, the New Bottom Line, the Alliance for a Just Society and Right to the City, to name a few, have joined with unions, Occupy Wall Street, Occupy Our Homes and hundreds of thousands of people who have stood up to Wall Street greed. Wall Street and banking royalty are no longer untouchable. We have the tools and we have the leverage--let's start using them to start winning for our communities and families. It is our responsibility to REBEL. All of our futures depend on it!

*These figures represent updated estimates from last year's report, The Win-Win Solution, from the New Bottom Line, which investigated the effects on the economy of writing down all underwater mortgages to current market value.",https://www.alternet.org/time-rebel-5-ways-we-can-break-big-banks-death-grip-economy,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

5267,5973,Pope Slams Fake News as Sign of Intolerance Spreading 'Hatred',"Pope Francis stressed to news consumers to watch out for fake news because ""there is no such thing as harmless disinformation; on the contrary, trusting in falsehood can have dire consequences.""

In his message “'The truth will set you free' (Jn 8:32): Fake news and journalism for peace,"" the pope stressed that the business of communications ""is part of God’s plan for us and an essential way to experience fellowship,"" but ""when we yield to our own pride and selfishness, we can also distort the way we use our ability to communicate.""

""The capacity to twist the truth is symptomatic of our condition, both as individuals and communities,"" he added.

The pope issued the message to mark the Catholic Church's World Communications Day, which falls on May 13, the Sunday before Pentecost.

Pope Francis noted that the spread of ""fake news"" calls for reflection and ""rediscovering the dignity of journalism and the personal responsibility of journalists to communicate the truth.""

He defined fake news as ""false information based on non-existent or distorted data meant to deceive and manipulate the reader,"" which ""can serve to advance specific goals, influence political decisions, and serve economic interests.""

""This false but believable news is 'captious,' inasmuch as it grasps people’s attention by appealing to stereotypes and common social prejudices, and exploiting instantaneous emotions like anxiety, contempt, anger and frustration. The ability to spread such fake news often relies on a manipulative use of the social networks and the way they function. Untrue stories can spread so quickly that even authoritative denials fail to contain the damage,"" the pontiff said.

""Disinformation thus thrives on the absence of healthy confrontation with other sources of information that could effectively challenge prejudices and generate constructive dialogue; instead, it risks turning people into unwilling accomplices in spreading biased and baseless ideas,"" he added. ""The tragedy of disinformation is that it discredits others, presenting them as enemies, to the point of demonizing them and fomenting conflict. Fake news is a sign of intolerant and hypersensitive attitudes, and leads only to the spread of arrogance and hatred. That is the end result of untruth.""

No one, Pope Francis said, is ""exempted from the duty of countering these falsehoods.""

""This is no easy task, since disinformation is often based on deliberately evasive and subtly misleading rhetoric and at times the use of sophisticated psychological mechanisms,"" he continued, praising efforts to teach news consumers how to ""take an active part in unmasking falsehoods, rather than unwittingly contributing to the spread of disinformation.""

""What is at stake is our greed. Fake news often goes viral, spreading so fast that it is hard to stop, not because of the sense of sharing that inspires the social media, but because it appeals to the insatiable greed so easily aroused in human beings. The economic and manipulative aims that feed disinformation are rooted in a thirst for power, a desire to possess and enjoy, which ultimately makes us victims of something much more tragic: the deceptive power of evil that moves from one lie to another in order to rob us of our interior freedom,"" the pope said. ""That is why education for truth means teaching people how to discern, evaluate and understand our deepest desires and inclinations, lest we lose sight of what is good and yield to every temptation.""",https://pjmedia.com/faith/pope-slams-fake-news-sign-intolerance-spreading-arrogance-hatred/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

8823,9998,Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins see shutdown deal as opening to help Obamacare insurers,"A pair of Republican senators said that ending the government shutdown could open the door to bringing up bills aimed at stabilizing Obamacare’s insurance exchanges by funneling more money to insurers.

Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Susan Collins, R-Maine, said Monday that an end to the three-day shutdown would bring Congress closer to getting deals on a variety of issues that include two Obamacare stabilization bills.

“My goal is to create a process to get us to yes on a lot of issues,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. “I think we are close to getting deals.”

Graham referred to several issues that include military spending, immigration, and the cost-sharing reduction payments to Obamacare insurers, known as CSRs.

Collins agreed to vote for tax reform last year after getting a commitment from Senate GOP leadership and President Trump that two Obamacare bills would become law by the end of the year. She also got on board tax reform after leadership agreed to include several of her amendments in the final bill.

However, passage of the two bills has been harder in the House where opposition among conservatives is widespread. Conservatives say the deals would be a ""bailout"" for a program they believe is failing and in need of a more drastic overhaul.

Collins said that negotiations with the House on the CSR deal are “going very well. The deadline slipped but the policy is what is important.”

Collins added that there is no immediate reason to get the bills passed now. She said tax reform’s repeal of the individual mandate, which requires everyone to get insurance, does not go into effect until 2019.

“We do have a little time here,” she said.

One bill from Sens Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Patty Murray, D-Wash., would fund CSRs for two years. In return, states would get limited flexibility to waive some Obamacare insurer regulations.

Another bill sponsored by Collins and Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., gives states $10 billion over two years to set up a reinsurance program. Reinsurance covers the sickest claims for an Obamacare insurer, who would in turn lower premiums for everyone else.",http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/lindsey-graham-and-susan-collins-see-shutdown-deal-as-opening-to-help-obamacare-insurers/article/2646666,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

I will mobilize your troops and cavalry and make you a vast and mighty horde, all fully armed. Persia [Iran], Ethiopia, and Put [Libya] will join you, too, with all their weapons. Gomer [Turkey] and all its hordes will also join you, along with the armies of Beth-togarmah [Turkey, Armenia, and the Turkish-speaking people of Asia Minor] from the distant north and many others.’” Ezekiel 38:1-6 (emphasis mine)

13- Attempts for World Peace

“For when they say, “Peace and safety!” then sudden destruction comes upon them, as labor pains upon a pregnant woman. And they shall not escape.” 1 Thess. 5:3

Bertrand Daily Report The War For Our Mind & Soul Continues

By Capt. Dave Bertrand, Ret.

Well…here we go again with Munchkin-Un extremely close to delivering an ICBM into the heartland of America and hopefully you haven’t eaten all your stored jerky meat from the last warning concerning an all-out civil war attack by Obama and Eric Holder’s ANTIFA, which (WE) successfully scared the crap out of them (literarily) with our 2nd amendment right to counter an attack…..in any event, buy more jerky and toothpicks.

Far worse than a bunch of communist thugs in the streets wanting to kill cops and white supporters of Trump, is the reality of what these same thugs will want from you if North Korea decides to deliver an ICBM with an EMP nuclear warhead….they will be very hungry and will want your jerky.

Yes…it’s far more serious than anyone can imagine and we cannot make lite of what is now (maybe) a 90% probability America will be hit with a nuclear warhead, if it is not intercepted by one of the missile shields…..but here’s the Catch 22 situation by shooting down and destroying a nuclear warhead (in our atmosphere) which can cause an Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP). Instead of several hundred thousand dying from a direct hit on the ground, an EMP detonation in the atmosphere, will cause millions to die in about 90 days from food starvation, disease and madness. Within seconds, we could find ourselves back in time before electric was discovered.

Therefore…..why not destroy North Korea before Munchkin-Un delivers the big one?

The communist Left (Pelosi and Schumer et al) would use a pre-emptive attack by President Trump as a reason for impeachment and/or war crimes. At the same time, Seoul Korea would be hit with a barrage of missiles, killing thousands if not millions, unless the United States uses their space based weapon technology for a surprise hit.

The pressure by the Left to keep Trump at bay could easily cause this administration to accept a nuclear hit from North Korea. At the same time, Russia and China are not completely onboard with Trump launching a pre-emptive strike…..and what can we do as a civilization on the brink of a nuclear attack? Get prepared….buy more jerky, tuna and store water. And yes….ammo for when the thugs come looking for your supplies.

Today’s Featured Article / Report

So How Are These Large EMP Pulses Created?

The phenomenon is called Electro-Magnetic Pulse, or EMP for short. One way to create a wide scale EMP pulse is to detonate a nuclear weapon.

During the initial energy release from a nuclear weapon, a large electromagnetic field in the form of a “pulse” radiates outward. This pulse from the explosion will travel in a line of sight fashion. Any electrical wiring in the path of the pulse will burn out.

The nuclear explosion does not have to be very large to generate a dangerous EMP. At least dangerous for our computer friends, not so much for us.

Unlike the radiation released during the nuclear explosion, EMP is not particularly dangerous to people. Unless you have a pacemaker installed. But it will destroy most unshielded electrical components.",http://beforeitsnews.com/war-and-conflict/2017/11/if-north-korea-decides-to-deliver-an-icbm-with-an-emp-nuclear-warhead-2468783.html,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

592,674,Canadians Celebrate American Thanksgiving By Giving Thanks They’re Not American,"IN what is being described as a major break from tradition, Canadians across the globe are embracing and celebrating American Thanksgiving this year, specifically giving thanks they’re not American.

For the first time ever, despite celebrating their own Thanksgiving only 6 short weeks ago, citizens of the great White North are coming together with family and friends to give thanks they’re not presently residing in the United States.

“When you see what’s going on down there, specifically in the past 206 days, it really just puts things into perspective,” one Canadian woman posted on facebook. “Makes you want to grab your loved ones close and thank God none of you are American.”

Another man who described himself as a “proud Canadian”, today admitted he was celebrating an American holiday for the first time.

“Last year I needed life saving surgery I couldn’t afford and the Canadian government didn’t let me die, so yeah, I’m pretty thankful I’m not American,” he tweeted.

CBC News interviewed one local Calgary family, the Roberts, who were busy going around the dinner table, each giving a reason why they’re thankful to not be from the USA.

“Abortion, gun control, oh, oh, Trump, Spacey, Harvey Weinstein!” declared the youngest child. “Oh, those are good ones,” Mrs Roberts replied, reminding the children of the importance of understanding exactly why to be so thankful they’re not part of the 50 states.

The Roberts’ eldest daughter, explained some of the differences between the two countries she’s most thankful for, saying:

“You know it’s the little things. Like when I go to the mall or to school in Canada I’m like a lot less likely to be killed by an assault rifle than if I were in the States, so I’m thankful for that I guess… And you know, healthcare has its uses i suppose.”

Meanwhile in a televised address, Prime Minister Trudeau stopped short of declaring the day an official Canadian holiday but reminded Canadians to remember those less fortunate.

“Today, let us all come together and remember that no matter what I’m doing, it could be worse,” the PM said in the House of Commons. “All Canadians should give thanks we didn’t have to choose between Clinton or Trump. Not every country is so lucky to have such amazing politicians as Canada.”

8477,9591,Will Trump Try Blackwater?,"Will Trump Try Blackwater?

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION is considering a set of proposals developed by Blackwater founder Erik Prince and a retired CIA officer — with assistance from Oliver North, a key figure in the Iran-Contra scandal — to provide CIA Director Mike Pompeo and the White House with a global, private spy network that would circumvent official U.S. intelligence agencies, according to several current and former U.S. intelligence officials and others familiar with the proposals. The sources say the plans have been pitched to the White House as a means of countering “deep state” enemies in the intelligence community seeking to undermine Donald Trump’s presidency.

The creation of such a program raises the possibility that the effort would be used to create an intelligence apparatus to justify the Trump administration’s political agenda.

“Pompeo can’t trust the CIA bureaucracy, so we need to create this thing that reports just directly to him,” said a former senior U.S. intelligence official with firsthand knowledge of the proposals, in describing White House discussions. “It is a direct-action arm, totally off the books,” this person said, meaning the intelligence collected would not be shared with the rest of the CIA or the larger intelligence community. “The whole point is this is supposed to report to the president and Pompeo directly.”

North, who appears frequently on Trump’s favorite TV network, Fox News, was enlisted to help sell the effort to the administration. He was the “ideological leader” brought in to lend credibility, said the former senior intelligence official.

Some of the individuals involved with the proposals secretly met with major Trump donors asking them to help finance operations before any official contracts were signed.

The proposals would utilize an army of spies with no official cover in several countries deemed “denied areas” for current American intelligence personnel, including North Korea and Iran. The White House has also considered creating a new global rendition unit meant to capture terrorist suspects around the world, as well as a propaganda campaign in the Middle East and Europe to combat Islamic extremism and Iran.

“I can find no evidence that this ever came to the attention of anyone at the NSC or [White House] at all,” wrote Michael N. Anton, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, in an email. “The White House does not and would not support such a proposal.” But a current U.S. intelligence official appeared to contradict that assertion, stating that the various proposals were first pitched at the White House before being delivered to the CIA. The Intercept reached out to several senior officials that sources said had been briefed on the plans by Prince, including Vice President Mike Pence. His spokesperson wrote there was “no record of [Prince] ever having met with or briefed the VP.” North did not respond to a request for comment.

According to two former senior intelligence officials, Pompeo has embraced the plan and lobbied the White House to approve the contract. Asked for comment, a CIA spokesperson said, “You have been provided wildly inaccurate information by people peddling an agenda.”

At the heart of the scheme being considered by the White House are Blackwater founder Erik Prince and his longtime associate, CIA veteran John R. Maguire, who currently works for the intelligence contractor Amyntor Group. Maguire also served on Trump’s transition team. Amyntor’s role was first reported by BuzzFeed News.

Michael Barry, who was recently named NSC senior director for intelligence programs, worked closely with Prince on a CIA assassination program during the Bush administration.

Prince and Maguire deny they are working together. Those assertions, however, are challenged by current and former U.S. officials and Trump donors who say the two men were collaborating.

As with many arrangements in the world of CIA contracting and clandestine operations, details of who is in charge of various proposals are murky by design and change depending on which players are speaking. An Amyntor official said Prince was not “formally linked to any contract proposal by Amyntor.” In an email, Prince rejected the suggestion that he was involved with the proposals. When asked if he has knowledge of this project, Prince replied: “I was/am not part of any of those alleged efforts.”

The former senior intelligence official with direct knowledge of the efforts scoffed at Prince’s denials. “Erik’s proposal had no company names on the slides,” this person said, “but there is no doubt that Prince and Maguire were working together.”

Prince and Maguire have a long professional relationship. Maguire recently completed a stint as a consultant with Prince’s company, Frontier Services Group, a Hong Kong-based security and logistics company partially owned by the Chinese government. FSG has no known connections to the private spy plan.

Prince has strong ties to the Trump administration: His sister Betsy DeVos is secretary of education, he was a major donor to the Trump election campaign, and he advised the transition team on intelligence and defense appointments, as The Intercept has previously reported. Prince has also contributed to Pence’s campaigns.

Maguire spent more than two decades as a paramilitary officer in the CIA, including tours in Central America working with the Contras. He has extensive experience in the Middle East, where he helped plan the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

Maguire and Prince met together in September with a senior CIA official at a Virginia restaurant to discuss privatizing the war in Afghanistan.

Prince told a top fundraiser that Maguire was working on part of his Afghanistan plan, characterizing it as the first part of a multi-pronged program. The fundraiser added that Prince never directly asked him for money. But sources close to the project say Maguire did seek private funding for Amyntor’s efforts until a CIA contract materialized. “They’ve been going around asking for a bridge loan to float their operations until the CIA says yes,” said a person who has been briefed on the fundraising efforts.

Beginning last spring and into the summer, Maguire and a group of Amyntor representatives began asking Trump donors to support their intelligence efforts in Afghanistan, the initial piece of what they hoped would be a broader program. Some Trump fundraisers were asked to provide introductions to companies and wealthy clients who would then hire Amyntor for economic intelligence contracts. Maguire explained that some of the profit from those business deals would fund their foreign intelligence collection. Others were asked to give money outright.

“[Maguire] said there were people inside the CIA who joined in the previous eight years [under Obama] and inside the government, and they were failing to give the president the intelligence he needed,” said a person who was pitched by Maguire and other Amyntor personnel. To support his claim, Maguire told at least two people that National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, in coordination with a top official at the National Security Agency, authorized surveillance of Steven Bannon and Trump family members, including Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump. Adding to these unsubstantiated claims, Maguire told the potential donors he also had evidence McMaster used a burner phone to send information gathered through the surveillance to a facility in Cyprus owned by George Soros.

Amyntor employees took potential donors to a suite in the Trump Hotel in Washington, which they claimed was set up to conduct “secure communications.” Some White House staff and Trump campaign supporters came to refer to the suite as “the tinfoil room,” according to one person who visited the suite. This account was confirmed by another source to whom the room was described. “John [Maguire] was certain that the deep state was going to kick the president out of office within a year,” said a person who discussed it with Maguire. “These guys said they were protecting the president.”

Maguire and others at Amyntor have boasted that they have already sent intelligence reports to Pompeo.

7737,8794,"Trump administration creates religious liberty division to allow doctors to opt out of abortions, transgender surgeries","The Trump administration created a new office to help doctors and other providers to not perform services that violate their religious or moral beliefs such as abortions or transgender surgery.

Health and Human Services created a new division on religious liberty in its Office of Civil Rights. The division was created as part of a direction under President Trump’s executive order last May that called for the federal government to do more to uphold religious liberty.

“Too many of these healthcare practitioners have been bullied and discriminated against because of their religious beliefs or moral convictions,” said acting HHS Secretary Eric Hargan at an event at HHS in Washington on Thursday.

Hargan said that there are already strong laws that ensure healthcare providers do not have to provide services that would violate religious or moral beliefs.

Now those laws will be “vigorously enforced by [Office of Civil Rights],” he said.

The Office of Civil Rights is HHS' law enforcement agency, which enforces federal laws over civil rights and conscience.

HHS said on its new website on the division that healthcare workers can file a complaint if they are forced to performing or objected to a medical procedure, which includes abortion or sterilization, or any related training or research.

""The creation of the new division will provide HHS with the focus it needs to more vigorously and effectively enforce existing laws protecting the rights of conscience and religious freedom, the first freedom protected in the Bill of Rights,"" HHS said.

The policy is expected to ensure that doctors or other healthcare providers opt out of providing abortions or transgender surgeries.

""For too long, governments big and small have treated conscience claims with hostility instead of protection, but change is coming and it begins here and now,"" said Office of Civil Rights Director Roger Severino.

House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., hoped the division would target a 2015 California law that requires crisis pregnancy centers to notify women of access to low-cost abortions. The pregnancy centers are often run by religious organizations and are aimed at convincing women to not get an abortion.

Abortion rights advocates charge that the pregnancy centers, which are around the country, are confusing to pregnant women and that such requirements are needed.

McCarthy said that under the Obama administration, HHS had a “silent refusal to defend our rights.”

Several speakers at the event highlighted the case of Little Sisters of the Poor, which sued the Obama administration over Obamacare’s birth control mandate. The nonprofit charity argued that the mandate for employers and insurers to provide birth control to female employees violated their religious beliefs.

The Obama administration gave religious organizations such as churches an exemption to the mandate. It also reached a compromise for privately held companies and religious nonprofits such as charities or universities. Employees of the organizations could receive birth control but the government would pick up the tab.

The Trump administration scaled back the birth control mandate last year to allow any employer that had a religious or moral objection to get an exemption.

Anti-abortion groups applauded the move by HHS to create a new division. Susan B. Anthony List cited the example of a nurse named Cathy DeCarlo who was threatened with the loss of her job for refusing to carry out a late-term abortion.

“We also urge the administration to release new regulations further clarifying the laws this division will enforce,” said SBA List President Marjorie Dannenfelser.

But the gay civil rights group Human Rights Campaign blasted the decision, charging that the new division will allow healthcare workers to discriminate against patients based on their gender identity or other factors. The campaign argued that the division would tie the hands of healthcare providers from taking any action against anti-gay employees from opting out of critical healthcare procedures.

“Every American deserves access to medically necessary healthcare, and that healthcare should not be determined by the personal opinions of individual healthcare providers or administrative staff,” said HRC Legal Director Sarah Warbelow.",http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/trump-administration-creates-religious-liberty-division-to-allow-doctors-to-opt-out-of-abortions-transgender-surgeries/article/2646309,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

A case in point is the recent Vox column by Umair Irfan, warning that the Bitcoin network has caused a huge surge in energy consumption. And yet, Irfan’s own article admits that even the largest estimate—which could be double the actual figure—suggests Bitcoin only uses about 0.14 percent of global electricity. It seems somewhat unfair to single out Bitcoin and ignore the other 99.86 percent of the activities that use electricity.

Snark aside, Bitcoin admittedly does use a surprising amount of electricity. Although the estimates are uncertain, Irfan quotes figures suggesting that (in early December) it took some 250 kilowatt-hours of energy to process a single transaction. (For a frame of reference, that’s enough energy to support a typical U.S. household for eight days.) Other statistics show that—assuming the figures on Bitcoin’s usage are correct—the network consumes more electricity than the country of Serbia, and the electricity used to run the Bitcoin network is enough to provide for almost 3 million U.S. households. Yet how meaningful are these types of stats? Wikipedia reports that in June 2015, the website Vox.com had 54 million unique visitors. If those people had spent their time volunteering, rather than reading Vox, can you imagine how much litter could have been picked up? How many trees planted? How many stories could have been read to children? When the price of Bitcoin surges—as it was doing when the Vox story ran, though as of this writing it is crashing once again—it ramps up electricity usage. By design, a new “block” (which is 1MB in size) gets added to the “blockchain”—which is the public ledger recording all Bitcoin transactions going back to the launch in 2009—every ten minutes. If the Bitcoin price is high enough to entice more people to enter the industry with their computers to “mine” bitcoins, then the protocol automatically adjusts the difficulty of the computational problems necessary in order to “solve” a new block and be rewarded bitcoins accordingly. (For more information on how Bitcoin and “mining” works, see the free guide I co-authored.)

Now if we ask: “Is it ‘worth it’ to have Bitcoin use so much electricity?” the answer is, “It depends on whether you think the Bitcoin network is valuable.” Yes, it takes a lot of electricity to power the computers running through so many calculations, but it’s this very system that ensures the integrity of the Bitcoin protocol. When the price skyrockets, you don’t want some rich investors to be able to stroll in with powerful computers and take over the whole network. So yes, there’s a sense in which all this computer processing (and implied electricity consumption) is “wasteful,” but only in the same way that it was such a “waste” that humans put so much steel and concrete into early bank vaults. In a free society, there is a general presumption that market price signals guide entrepreneurs to steer resources into the correct lines. So if it’s profitable to be using so much computing power to mine new bitcoins, we have prima facie evidence that the activity is “worth it.” Yet there are two caveats to this general principle. First, we might worry that Bitcoin is in a bubble. And indeed, as of this writing, the price is down some 50% from its all-time (and recent) high. The introduction of futures markets in Bitcoin should help coordinate these activities over the long-term, but still, the volatile price of Bitcoin should make us more reserved when we comment on what “the market price” is telling us about the cryptocurrency. But when it comes down to it, ultimately the people investing their own money in buying new mining rigs (and paying exorbitant electric bills) are the ones with the most to lose, if the Bitcoin price crashes and renders their operations unprofitable.

Continued below... Second, critics such as our Vox author worry that electricity consumption contributes to climate change, because we lack a “carbon tax” and hence Bitcoin miners aren’t internalizing the true social costs of their activities. Elsewhere I have critiqued the case for a carbon tax, on both conceptual and pragmatic grounds (see, e.g., my Cato article co-authored with two climate scientists). So I simply dispute the claim that energy in general, and electricity in particular, is “underpriced” because of climate change concerns. However, where the Vox author and I should be able to agree is on the harm of government subsidies for electricity. For example, apparently there is a cottage industry in Bitcoin mining in Venezuela, because (a) the government-issued currency is in hyperinflation while (b) the government subsidizes electricity so that it is almost free. We at the Institute for Energy Research champion the benefits of free energy markets, and that includes the elimination of subsidies that distort consumption patterns. So if the writers at Vox and other outlets want to join us in calling for smaller government (in this dimension), we welcome their support.

The Institute for Energy Research (IER) is a not-for-profit organization that conducts intensive research and analysis on the functions, operations, and government regulation of global energy markets. IER maintains that freely-functioning energy markets provide the most efficient and effective solutions to today’s global energy and environmental challenges and, as such, are critical to the well-being of individuals and society.

5482,6238,Canyon de Chelly National Monument,"Determined to locate this mystery woman, I stood on the south rim staring out at iconic Spider Rock, zooming and telescoping patiently as I brought the 800-feet-tall, free-standing monolith into focus, sweeping my fading eyes over the wind-swept, sandstone pillars familiar to anyone with a television set - it’s a popular backdrop for commercials.

I didn’t know Spiderman had a lady friend living in Arizona, or that she lived atop the taller of two spires known as Spider Rock in Canyon de Chelly (pronounced “Duh Shay”), a large sheltered gorge of multiple canyons in the otherwise mundane brown terrain west of the Chuska Mountains. To outsiders, Canyon de Chelly near Chinle is a desolate and remote place, a thing of such unusual beauty it has become a mandatory stop on anyone’s Southwest itinerary. Inhabited continuously for roughly 5,000 years by Native Americans, including the cliff-dwelling Anasazi, this is one place we just had to see for ourselves.

If you visit this marvelous place, be forewarned that with few exceptions, travel and activities are restricted once you enter the canyon floor; no wild, drunken kegers during the eclipse howling at the heavenly bodies dancing around the bonfire.

But Spider Woman, a deity of Navajo lore, was not to be found where she’s reputed to live, feasting on the unruly and deserving - kids mostly. All I spotted was a large pile of bleached bones heaped on the spire’s summit, a couple of Phoenix Suns baseball caps, some ugly Nike Zoom KD IVs scattered at random, and several pairs of empty baggy jeans. And a big jug of KC’s Sweet & Tangy barbeque sauce.

People live here, and cultural sensitivities should be respected. The consumption and mere possession of alcohol is strictly prohibited on the reservation (lock it in the trunk and keep it out of your room), an eclipse is never celebrated, and you most definitely would be trespassing if you stroll into the canyon on a whim. Break the rules and Spider Woman will drag you to the top of her rocky lair and separate you limb from limb, peeling meat from the bone, while you look on with utter dismay as she tries on your Nikes.

While free to peer to your heart’s delight at the plunging cliffs, distant walls and lush bottom-land from the north and south rims, and even hike unaccompanied down the White House Ruins Trail, you’ll need a Navajo guide or park ranger to get down in there with the marrow where the Dineh live, where 2,700 archeological sites are scattered about the numerous beige canyons, small and large, and where you’ll find petroglyphs, and many ruins still standing, stabilized and protected from the elements - a mere sampling of 700 existing structures which serve as testament to ancient Anasazi culture.

Technically a national monument, the 84,000 acres of Canyon de Chelly are not federal lands, but Navajo tribal trust lands populated by a small community of 40 Navajo families who reside in the monument proper. Some live in traditional hogans on the green, valley floor among fluorescent cottonwoods as they have for 300 years, and continue tending sheep and goats, growing crops on their small plots, and staring up at the sun dipping prematurely beneath the rim of 1,000-foot slabs of red and white sandstone walls streaked black and tan. Tough making a living here, they get by selling turquoise jewelry, and pottery adorned in elaborate patterns, and exquisite woven tapestries to visiting tourists down there near the ruins, and along the rim at strategically-placed overlooks, and in the lodges and gift shops at Chinle.

Despite the tranquility, life hasn’t always been peaceful for the people of Canyon de Chelly. In 1805, warring Spaniards fired on a large group of terrified old Navajo men, women and children hiding in an alcove way up on the side of a relatively inaccessible wall, killing 115 in a bloody hail of bullets. The Navajo call this place of disgrace ‘Adah Aho’ doo’ nili,’ and if you should scramble up to the alcove, if that’s even possible, you should be able to see where Spanish bullets pockmarked the wall.

Legendary American hero, Kit Carson, the Indian-fighting butcher with blood up to his eyeballs, though initially reluctant, oversaw the Battle of Canyon de Chelly in 1864 which essentially ended the long-running Navajo Wars.

During a winter blizzard of deep snow, Kit Carson and several hundred soldiers conducted a scorched-earth policy in these canyons, marching up and down from multiple directions, torching and destroying Navajo camps, crops and supplies, and any semblance of infrastructure necessary for the Navajo’s winter survival. They filled in water holes. They hunted the people down. The shameful Navajo campaign was ethnic cleansing at its worst.

One of the remaining bands of Navajo took their last stand on top of the rocky butte known as Fortress Rock. But despite stockpiling food and sneaking down off the butte for water in the dead of night, the elements proved too much. Most of the Navajo at Fortress Rock eventually turned themselves in and joined the largest mass surrender of Native Americans in United States history.

Roughly 8,000 – 9,000 men, women and children made the pointless, gruesome, deadly walk 450 miles east to the Basque Redondo reservation, near Fort Sumner, New Mexico, known to the people as Hwéeldi where they continued to endure much suffering and death.

Where was Spider Woman, you might ask, during this terribly sad period in Navajo history? Given the sheer horror, ghastly even by Syrian standards, you’d think some of those bones atop Spider Rock should have been those of Kit Carson and his men, and those whose directives they followed before, during and after the Long March. (Granted, the Americans were under orders, and yes, the Navajo did some killing of their own, … but come on ....)

To white tourists standing near the edge of the beautiful south rim feeling warm and fuzzy being in Indian country, harmonious and bursting with indigenous vibes, and at peace with Mother Nature, the Navajo Wars might seem like just another footnote in the guide book. But the events of 1864 happened not that long ago. To the Dineh, the Long March to the place of untold sorrow and misery happened yesterday. Something to think about when you tip your guide at the end of the day.",http://canadafreepress.com/article/canyon-de-chelly-national-monument,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

Hillary Clinton and her crew get a pass for colluding to stack the deck against Bernie. No matter what the evidence revealed the FBI nomenclature predetermined that New York’s sixth crime family was untouchable. Congressional insiders report they have uncovered new irregularities and contradictions inside the FBI’s probe of Hillary Clinton’s email server.

Investigators say there is written evidence that the FBI found evidence that some laws were broken when the former secretary of State and her top aides transmitted classified information through her insecure private email server.

Let’s see; the Clinton campaign pays for a former British spy to work with Russian intelligence to create a bogus document that is then used as the basis for wiretaps aimed at the Trump campaign and the media is trying to tell us, “Move along nothing to see here.”

Was the so-called dossier a hit piece from the beginning? Maybe we should listen to Mary Jacoby, the wife of Glenn Simpson, the former Wall Street Journal reporter who started Fusion GPS, the firm behind the dossier.

She said on Facebook, “It’s come to my attention that some people still don’t realize what Glenn’s role was in exposing Putin’s control of Donald Trump. Let’s be clear. Glenn conducted the investigation. Glenn hired Chris Steele. Chris Steele worked for Glenn.”

In December of 1914 in the first bitter winter of a long bitter war, the solders of the German Empire and the soldiers of the British Empire defied the orders of their officers. They abandoned their hastily dug entrenchments that would soon grow into an elaborate maze of trenches stretching from Switzerland to the English Channel to meet each other in no man’s land. They sang hymns and exchanged gifts in a spontaneous outpouring of the feelings of peace, fellowship, and forgiveness which were then the staples of a Christ centered Christmas season.

In the midst of the War to End War these enemies found peace in the love of their Savior. Can we at least hope that in the midst of what feels like a terminally divided America if we would take His hand, if we would follow Him maybe we could do the same?

The season for which He is the reason is upon us so let us reflect:

IMPEACH TRUMP! IMPEACH TRUMP! IMPEACH TRUMP!

That is the screech we’re about to hear emanating from the denizens of the swamp. Sure Maxine Waters and a few others have been singing this song since election night when their plans for the last nail in our coffin went down in flames. Now it’s beginning to percolate through the monotone media megaphone. And though this was predicted in this column by this author before the inauguration, it still has a jarring impact on the senses.

Back in the Dream Times when the Deep State was able to turn Watergate into a Silent Coup the precedent was set. If someone tries to overturn the moneychanger’s tables they must be destroyed. If it’s a president, even one elected for the sole purpose of adding some reality to the mirage of our functioning oligarchy which portrays itself as a dysfunctional democratic republic, they must be hounded out of office, disgraced, and discredited.

Is the entire Mueller investigation a false flag distraction to cover the tracks of the people who really did attempt to undermine an American presidential election?

Some background to this part of the plot must include the fact that the former FBI Director James Comey has admitted to illegally leaking transcripts of privileged conversations with the President to the press. Why did he do it? Comey testified before a Senate Committee that he orchestrated the leak of accounts of conversations with President Donald Trump because he thought it might lead to the appointment of a special prosecutor to lead the Russia investigation.

She took over after the artful dodger, Debbie Wasserman Schultz who had been run out of Dodge after leaked emails showed the depth of her complicity in the rigged primary. According to Ms. Brazile, “Debbie was not a good manager. She hadn’t been very interested in controlling the party—she let Clinton’s headquarters in Brooklyn do as it desired. ...”

Finally after months of exhaustive research the spy-master of the most extensive surveillance campaign aimed at Americans can be revealed. The one man who used every avenue possible to invade the privacy of American citizens in History has had the mask of denial ripped away.

What is that common thread? Is it a political affiliation? Is it a nationality? Is it a certain type of weapon? No. None of these is the common thread.

What are the criteria for their choice of a news outlet? Does the news reader look or sound authoritative? Are they better looking? Do they have a more pleasing voice? Are they a male? Are they a female? Are they Gay? Are we not sure? Whatever the reason, it isn’t because they say anything different. It often sounds like they all have the same writers and story selectors.

President Trump’s speech before the UN was interesting in many ways.

He put the multinational globalists on official notice that he has their number and as far as he’s concerned their number is up. He let the UN bureaucrats know that their red tape parades have got to be reined in. He called socialism what it is, a failure. He held up capitalism as the means for raising people out of poverty and ignorance. He made the case for sovereignty both national, personal, and individual freedom. He pointed out that the US carries a disproportionate load for the support of the UN and that this has got to change or they might be looking for spare change if America cuts its funding for what has become an anti-American debating society. In other words, he let the world know that as far as his administration is concerned from now on it’s going to be America First.

The Donald won his miraculous victory based on promises that built an agenda to make America great again. These promises basically said that he would address three areas, the economy, the wall, and taxes. How’s he doing so far?

Remember the campaign? Trump leapt in front of a parade that began in 2009 with the birth of the TEA Party Movement. The Trump campaign embodied everything those who wanted America to recover from the Obama debacle desired. What it proclaimed, what we were promised was an end to open borders, a repeal and replace of Obamacare, tax reform, and an end to give-away trade deals that have impoverished and debilitated us. In other words an America First administration supported by a do-something Congress.

And what have we gotten for our vote? The RINOs led by Ryan, McConnell, McCain, Flake, and Graham continue to obstruct everything President Trump tries to do. No repeal and replace. No tax reform, no support on the immigrant ban, and no support in stopping the bogus Russian-under-every -table investigation.

I come from a union family. I grew up in a union home. The good pay and benefits gained by one of America’s greatest unions provided for my room and board every day that I lived at home. My father and my uncles were all proud union members. My brother and some of my best friends spent their entire careers as union workers and the unions are providing them with generous pensions and great benefits. I myself was at one time the Vice President of an International Union. For all of this I am grateful.

The right to organize is a time honored American tradition and one that I believe is guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution which states, “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.” Peaceable assembly is the hallmark of American union organizing.

The Founders had one great fear; that a time would come when the Federal Government would overstep its bounds and come to dominate the individual States. Can anyone reading this dispute that this is such a time?

Look at our State governments. They are so addicted to Federal money they can’t exist without it. And they can’t get it without enough strings attached to turn them into little more than marionettes. They prance upon the stage masquerading as independent actors. In reality almost every step, every hand movement, every program, policy, and mandate is choreographed in the imperial capital.

Are you against big government, high taxes, or just want to be left alone? Do you carry a Bible or are you self reliant? Do you store food, water, or supplies? Do you want to live off the grid without worry of the government telling you what to do? Do you believe in the Constitution and that America was great because of it? Then, my friends, you can rest assured you are on the governments watch list and now I have 100% documented proof to prove it.

In fact things are heating up for patriots, gun owners, veterans, and Christians. Ever since last years decision by the Ninth Circuit in the Dariano v. Morgan Hill Unified School District case, in which they ruled that a public school can ban the American flag all while displaying flags of other countries—things have really begun to hit the fan!

In most recent reports colleges have done everything from defaming the Constitution to all out shredding it, while other school districts have banned the American flag, while yet others are calling for any “patriotic paraphernalia” to be removed.

To make matters worse our government has published four documents that specifically targets patriots, and I do believe it’s only a matter of time before they come after patriots, such as myself, and any who stand in stark opposition against the things they are attempting to achieve—like global governance.

The America we live in today, is not the America we once knew. In the video below I delve through factually evidence that proves once an for all their targeted attack of patriot, gun owners, veterans, and Christians. Please, please don’t miss this critical report and share it with everyone you know.

According to a Military Training Manual our Founders were “extremists” and those who are like them should also be targeted:

“An ideology is a set of political beliefs about the nature of people and society. People who are committed to an ideology seek not only to persuade but to recruit others to their belief. In U.S. history, there are many examples of extremist ideologies and movements. The colonists who sought to free themselves from British rule and the Confederate states who sought to secede from the Northern states are just two examples.” (pg. 43)

…..

“Extremists often predict dire or catastrophic consequences from a situation or from a failure to follow a specific course, and they tend to exhibit a kind of crisis mindedness. It can be a Communist takeover, a Nazi revival, nuclear war, earthquakes, floods, or the wrath of God. Whatever it is, it is just around the corner unless we follow their program and listen to their special insight and wisdom, to which only the truly enlightened have access. For extremists, any setback or defeat is the beginning of the end.” (pg.41)

Furthermore the Start report titled, Hot Spots of Terrorism and Other Crimes in the US, defines Right-Wing Extremists as:

“Extreme Right-Wing: groups that believe that one’s personal and/or national “way of life” is under attack and is either already lost or that the threat is imminent (for some the threat is from a specific ethnic, racial, or religious group), and believe in the need to be prepared for an attack either by participating in paramilitary preparations and training or survivalism. Groups may also be fiercely nationalistic (as opposed to universal and international in orientation), anti-global, suspicious of centralized federal authority, reverent of individual liberty, and believe in conspiracy theories that involve grave threat to national sovereignty and/or personal liberty.” (pg.13)

Therefore any and all people who believe in liberty can be deemed an extremist! Be ready because it’s right around the corner…

Something dramatic is needed to undo the logjam in the U.S. Senate. The election of Judge Moore to represent the people of Alabama would be a good first step

PRESIDENT TRUMP’S STRANGE ENDORSEMENT

For the first eight months of his presidency, Donald Trump has been continually thwarted by a combination of the left-wing media, the “deep state” bureaucracy, the Democrats and the establishment Republicans. On his own, President Trump has made dramatic and positive executive orders, but his legislative accomplishments have been disappointing due to the powerful forces arrayed against him.



Theoretically, the President should have been able to achieve all of his goals because the Republicans control all branches of government. Regrettably, the uncooperative congressional leadership has not produced any major victories for the President or his 63 million supporters.

In essence, the “swamp” has not been drained and the “swamp creatures” are trying to drown the populist, nationalist agenda of President Trump In essence, the “swamp” has not been drained and the “swamp creatures” are trying to drown the populist, nationalist agenda of President Trump. Clearly, the GOP needs more change agents in Congress. Republicans have too many moderate and establishment members who like “business as usual.” Thus, the President’s call to repeal and replace Obamacare, cut taxes, build a border wall and provide Americans with improved infrastructure is not being heeded. With the clock ticking toward the mid-term elections, the time is running out for the President’s agenda to be implemented.



Next Tuesday in Alabama, Republican voters will have an outstanding opportunity to provide the President with some crucial assistance. There is an election to replace the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in February. The interim Senator, Luther Strange, is facing former State Supreme Court Chief Judge Roy Moore in the GOP run-off.



The Republican Party establishment wing desperately wants Strange to win this election. The poster child for the establishment Republicans is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), who has been in the U.S. Senate for almost 33 years. It is no surprise that McConnell is strongly supporting Strange in his race against Moore, who is a bona fide conservative leader with a strong history of upholding constitutional principles on the Alabama Supreme Court.



McConnell’s political action committee is pumping big money into Alabama to help Strange. Most importantly, Strange is receiving a massive boost today with a visit from President Trump to Huntsville, AL. The President has been tweeting messages of support for “Big Luther,” and will lead today’s rally on his behalf.

Election pits a Beltway “swamp creature” McConnell and his establishment colleagues against the true conservative reformers who supported President Trump in the 2016 election Curiously, the President is supporting a candidate who worked as a lobbyist on behalf of CAFTA, a trade deal that shipped thousands of Alabama jobs to Central America. In contrast, Donald Trump won the presidency on a platform that called for ending unfair trade deals such as CAFTA. Unlike Strange, Judge Moore is an ardent conservative who fought to uphold traditional marriage and the Ten Commandments while on the Alabama Supreme Court. He is being supported by many of the President’s most vocal defenders, including Fox News host Sean Hannity, former Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon, former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and former White House official Sebastian Gorka.



This runoff election pits a Beltway “swamp creature” McConnell and his establishment colleagues against the true conservative reformers who supported President Trump in the 2016 election. Evidently, the President is supporting Strange to bolster the standing of McConnell before important Senate votes on tax reform and repealing Obamacare.



While Strange is currently supporting the President’s agenda, his true allegiance is with McConnell and the Republican Party establishment. He initially signed a letter supporting McConnell’s position to keep the 60-vote threshold in the Senate. Later, Strange changed his view to align with President Trump, but only after finishing second to Moore in the Senate primary election.



Continued below... As Senator, Strange declined to co-sponsor the RAISE Act, an immigration bill that is supported by President Trump. Strange also voted to place additional sanctions on Russia and limit the authority of the President to rescind the measure. While the President signed the legislation, he was clearly perturbed at the infringement on his executive authority.



Judge Moore is the type of anti-establishment Republican that the U.S. Senate desperately needs. If he wins, other real conservatives would be encouraged to take on incumbent GOP Senators in 2018. The current Republican line up of U.S. Senators needs to be radically changed with an infusion of new blood and innovative ideas. This can only come from the outside, from the grassroots, not the Beltway.



If Strange wins, McConnell will be bolstered and it will be more of the same inaction from the U.S. Senate. Something dramatic is needed to undo the logjam in the U.S. Senate. The election of Judge Moore to represent the people of Alabama would be a good first step.

How do some marine organisms form their own glass “skeletons” in cold water?

Israeli researchers discover how sponges build glass skeletons that protect them from their environs



The technology for forming and shaping glass requires the application of heat at extremely high temperatures. So how do some marine organisms form their own glass “skeletons” in cold water? That mystery has now been partially solved by a team of Israeli and German scientists. And while the researchers admit that what the marine organisms are doing “is far beyond the abilities of current human technology,” further study may bring us closer to the ability to mimic the mechanism at room temperature in a lab.

The goal is to develop crystalline materials at the nano level for next-generation electronics. The team, headed by Prof. Emil Zolotoyabko of the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology and colleagues in Germany, headed by Dr. Igor Zlotnikov from TU Dresden, used nano-tomography and focused X-ray diffraction at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France. Understanding fully how the marine organisms work their glass magic would require multiple PhDs, but the basic principle is this: Two classes of sponges called Demospongiae and Hexactinellida build skeletons – called glass “spicules” – to provide them structural support and mechanical strength and to protect them from their environment. The tiny symmetrical spicules are just microns to millimeters long.—More…",http://canadafreepress.com/print_friendly/israeli-researchers-discover-how-sponges-build-glass-skeletons-that-protect,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

America The Distraught

By Ryan John Payne

January 24, 2018

O pitiful for blatant lies,

What calumny defamed!

For ample sharp-tongued fallacies

That spread like hungry flames!

America! America! God cannot bless a mess!

You traded good for Hollywood,

With nothing to invest!

Unmerciful for Christian peeps,

Who get blamed in the press!

A thorough scare, for freedom’s weak,

Which leaves us all perplexed!

America! America! You took God out of law!

And now there’s no more self-control,

And justice has been robbed!

O pitiful for heroes shamed,

For liberating crime!

Dissension in the ranks,

Had finally been aligned!

America! America! May God reap all the chaff!

No more success in such a mess,

For wickedness won’t last!

O futile are Americans’ dreams,

Garnered over all the years!

Outsourcing is the latest thing,

For industry to cheer!

America! America! Once self-employed and free,

But now our jobs that have been lost

Found homes across the sea.

5280,5987,The Proxy Crock Memos,"Occasionally, in the course of protracted battles, the combatants pause for a moment and reflect on their common humanity. They can meet unarmed on the field of battle to share laughter and a glimpse of life beyond the present conflict. These are just a brief interlude from the daily debauchery of warfare. And so it was last week in my interlude from the daily climate war.

Given the forest terrain and limited arms range, Civil War combatants were often positioned within ear shot of each other prior to battle. To keep their spirits up the Rebs would sing “Dixie” countered by Union chorus of the “Battle Hymn of the Republic”.

These duets could continue for hours, often ending with both sides singing “Home! Sweet Home!”….which is every soldier’s constant dream.

The most touching tales are the wartime Christmas stories. On Christmas Day, 1865 Union soldiers from Michigan decorated their mule teams with branches to simulate reindeer antlers and brought garland decorated carts of food and supplies to the occupied Georgian civilians.

The first Christmas of the First World War saw an impromptu cease fire and then the British troops sang “Silent Night”, followed by the Germans with “Stille Nacht”. Soon unarmed soldiers ventured into No Man’s Land, exchanged tobacco and candies. One German juggler preformed his pre-war circus act and each side returned to the muddy, blood filled trenches and more years of debauchery.

In December of 1944, the Germans launched the Battle of the Bulge and again there was a moment for Christmas magic. In a number of places along the front another impromptu cease fire and again the dual language duets of “Silent Night”. That Christmas eve another startling event occurred.

In a candlelight cottage in the Hurtgen Forest, the wife of a German army cook, Elisabeth Vincken and her 12-year-old son, Fritz were preparing their holiday dinner when there was a knock on the door. Three GI’s, one badly wounded, asked for a night’s shelter from the freezing, damp darkness. As this group struggled with their language barrier there was another knock on the door.

This time it was four German soldiers seeking warmth, food and light. Frau Vincken informed them that they were welcome, but must share with her other guests. These seven soldiers all laid down their arms for the night, and for a brief moment, there was peace in one small place in the world.

Concealed by the mainstream media forest there is another battle raging today. Scarcely visible to most is the fact that one side is motivated by a desire for slavery, fascism and eugenics that surpasses all previous attempts at these forms of human debauchery. This is the hidden hand of carbon control proponents.

Carbon Dating, NOT !

My satire, Amazing! New! Wrongco’s Proxy Crock! exposed just a few of the false methods and assumption used by Climatologists to establish ‘their’ version of Earth history. This is NOT meant to trivialize this mortal weakness in their hypothesis. This is merely me, standing in No Man’s Land and juggling for the relief of both sides, before returning to the trenches.

Tree rings tell you only ONE thing, the total growing season of that tree, in that location, for that year. Ice core layer thickness tells you the amount of snow that remained in that location in that year. Both of these ‘proxies’ are subject to variables that reduce certainty, though Climatologists can’t bring themselves to mention any of these latent defects.

Useable ice cores only occur in Greenland and Antarctica and to claim that the compressed layers give an adequate measure of temperature in that location is a BALD FACED LIE. To then claim that these newly declared temperatures, from these two locations are representative of the entire planets temperature is a BALD FACED EXTRAPOLATION OF A LIE.

Much has been written by this and other authors on the defects of all Climatology proxies, but of interest are further problems with Carbon-14 dating mentions in the Proxy Crock article. Cosmic rays were first discovered in 1912 by Victor Hess (Nobel 1936) and are very poorly understood to this date.

The first measurements of field strength and direction came in 1954 and are known to be modified by solar wind, Earth’s magnetic field and the Sun’s heliosheath. It was not until 2007 that scientists were able to locate the top two dozen sources of these rays in regions termed ‘active galactic nuclei’. The term ‘ray’ is actually a misnomer, since these are in fact streams of protons (89%), alpha particles (10%) and beta particles.

These particles continuously bombard and destroy molecules and atoms world-wide, with varying anomalies which are just now being explored. IBM studies suggest that there is one cosmic ray induced error per month for every 256 MB of RAM in every computer on Earth. It has been suggested that some fly-by-wire errors in the Airbus A330 are from cosmic rays.

These rays also degrade most proxy data in a non-uniform way. For the purposes of C-14 dating, atmospheric rates are ASSUMED constant for the last 100,000 years. This is a dangerous assumption for any scientist attempting accuracy. There will be further discussions of carbon dating flaws in the near future, but for now we’ll stick our focus to that one-eyed myopic monster called the Clima-clops.

Clima-clops Can Only See ONE Thing

Danish Astro-physics professor Henrik Svensmark submitted convincing research to the IPCC in 2006 on cosmic ray influence on weather. He was rejected by the Clima-clops for ONE REASON. The Clima-clops can only see ONE thing, and that is ‘man-made’ carbon dioxide, or more correctly, man released carbon dioxide.

It is a mortal weakness for those pretending omnipotence to admit that they don’t know everything. It is an equal weakness to admit what they’ve preached for decades is, upon further examination, WRONG. True science is in the final stages of proving that everything that Climatologists have been taught and have been saying is wrong. It will then be time to place their future testimony in context.

Radio commentator, Paul Harvey, had a news story about a bill, authored by Senator Duncan Scott and passed by both houses of the New Mexico legislature in 1995. This bill established new procedures for testimony of certain ‘expert’ witnesses in all of the states court proceedings.

“Proclaimed that: When a psychologist or psychiatrist testifies during a defendant’s competency hearing, the psychologist or psychiatrist shall wear a cone-shaped hat that is not less than two feet tall. The surface of the hat shall be imprinted with stars and lightning bolts. He shall be required to don a white beard not less than eighteen inches in length and shall punctuate critical elements of his testimony by stabbing the air with a wand and the bailiff shall dim the courtroom lights and administer two strikes to a Chinese gong.”

Admonishing these court ordered quacks was an affront the trial lawyers association who prevailed on the governor to veto the bill. I have witnessed first-hand the damage that these politely referred to ‘hired guns’ can do to dying families in our rotten divorce court system. Ruthless attorneys and their attorney friends-in-black-robes employ these court whores to help drain every drop of blood and to crack the bones and suck the marrow from this most vulnerable segment of the population, our dying families.

The UN is a self-appointed omnipotent judge of humanity. These mindless bureaucrats are accountable only to the elite who have bestowed them with ever increasing levels of power. The carbon tax grab was to be the final masterstroke in their planned world domination. They only needed a few ‘hired guns’ from the science community to pull off their heist.

These court # Climatologists were well into their testimony when the honest scientists showed up and began dimming the lights and banging the gong. Derided as deniers and flat Earthers, the true scientists continued to find flaws in every warmist claim. And as great as any lie told by the warmist, is the claim that their opposition is an organized, carbon energy funded cabal.

Virtually every dollar of the $80 billion of taxpayer funds wasted on this fraud was spent on the warmist position. The scant funding provided by the energy producing companies is dwarfed by the massive sums they have wasted on carbon capture, sequester, reduction and alternative energy research.

The lack of organization among deniers is changing as the realization of the enormous defects in the human cause change and the ominous hand of omnipotent one world government become ever more visible. Einstein wrote to a conscientious objector over the failure of pacifism to stop the excesses of Fascism and Communism. “Organized power can only be overcome by organized power”.

The true science proponents need your support. If you are a member of any science organization then you must organize your fellow members and oppose this Faux Science. You must force retraction of any previous science society support for this non science. You must help us dim the lights and bang the gong. If you’ve got a spare white beard and cone shaped hat for the Climatologists to wear, we’d welcome that as well.",http://canadafreepress.com/article/the-proxy-crock-memos,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

One “left for dead” asset class is quietly moving higher again… One “left for dead” asset class is quietly moving higher again…

Since bottoming in late June, the Bloomberg Commodity Index – which tracks nearly two dozen commodities across energy, grains, precious metals, industrial metals, and more – is up 11%.

And the index – considered the benchmark for the global commodities market – has picked up steam lately. About half of those gains occurred over just the past four weeks alone.

This rally shouldn’t come as much of a surprise. After all, the relationship between stocks and commodities reached a historic extreme last year. Take a look…

Commodities have only been this cheap relative to stocks two other times in the past 50 years. And in both cases, commodities dramatically outperformed stocks over the next several years.

The first time was just before President Richard Nixon took the U.S. dollar off the gold standard in the early 1970s. As you may recall, inflation skyrocketed, and commodity prices surged to absurd new highs over the next several years.

The second time was just before the last “ Melt Up ” in stocks during the dot-com boom. What many folks don’t realize is that many commodities actually bottomed more than a year before the stock market peaked. And again, they trounced the stock market for years.

Remember, commodities are notoriously cyclical… Remember, commodities are notoriously cyclical…

They go through massive booms and busts. As we often say… if you catch one of these big cycles at the wrong time, you’ll lose a fortune. Catch one early, though, and you may never have to work again.

The recent broad-based rally in commodity prices suggests that we may be in the early stages of another multiyear boom. Our colleague Steve Sjuggerud agrees…

In fact, he has been calling for this for nearly two years. Back in March 2016, Steve told his True Wealth subscribers to buy the “Masters of the Universe” in commodities.

In that issue, Steve noted that a classic “ bad to less bad ” opportunity could be taking shape. At the time, the entire global mining sector was starting to move higher.

Major miners Rio Tinto (RIO) and BHP Billiton (BHP) were leading the way. As Steve put it (emphasis added)…

When the stock prices of the global mining giants get going, triple-digit gains aren’t just possible… they’re normal. This could be the beginning of the next “up cycle” in global mining stocks – which have been good for hundreds-of-percent gains in the past… This is a fantastic “bad to less bad” opportunity. We don’t need to see good news from the Masters of the Universe. They’ve been in terrible shape for years. And everyone knows it. All we need to see is a slight shift in sentiment… for things to go from bad to less bad. And I think we have that, based on the recent price action.

His favorite “one click” way to benefit from the trend was the iShares MSCI Global Metals & Mining Producers Fund (PICK). Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton are among its top holdings, along with other Masters of the Universe like Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), whose massive Grasberg mine is one of the world’s largest copper mines.

You can likely guess what has happened since then… You can likely guess what has happened since then…

Just as Steve predicted, PICK has continued its uptrend. As you can see from the following chart, these companies have quietly moved higher as things have gone from bad to less bad in the sector…

True Wealth subscribers who followed Steve’s advice are sitting on 97% gains so far.

But like us, he believes a commodities boom could just be getting started… As a result, mining stocks appear to have plenty of room to run from here.

Of course, that doesn’t mean Steve is turning bearish on stocks just yet… Of course, that doesn’t mean Steve is turning bearish on stocks just yet…

In fact, he believes the “Melt Up” could run for another year or even two before the market finally peaks. That’s why Steve recently put together a presentation to help you maximize your gains during this once-in-a-lifetime event.

True Wealth – at a 75% discount. And for a limited time, you can get Steve’s “Melt Up Blueprint” – and all of his research in– at a 75% discount. Watch Steve’s free presentation right here

8343,9442,House lawmakers worry budget talks could nix a hike in Navy attack subs,"A group of 36 House lawmakers have urged appropriators not to cut a proposed hike in the number of new Navy fast-attack submarines as part of ongoing annual budget talks.

The bipartisan group wants the full $5.9 billion in funding that would allow the Navy to buy up to 13 Virginia-class subs to be part of any final 2018 budget compromise, according to a letter sent to the House Appropriations defense subcommittee. That is $698 million more than what President Trump requested and an increase of three submarines.

The letter was released this week by three members of the Armed Services Committee — who each represent districts around sub-building shipyards— as Congress continues to wrangle over a deal to fund the military and rest of the federal government after Jan. 19, when the current stopgap measure expires.

“It is vital that Congress send a clear signal of support to our fleet commanders and our industrial base by ensuring that the final funding package provides as robust an investment possible in our undersea fleet,” the lawmakers wrote to Rep. Kay Granger, R-Texas, and Rep. Peter Visclosky, D-Ind., the chairwoman and ranking member of the appropriations subcommittee.

The hike in Virginia-class submarines has already become law because it was included in the $700 billion National Defense Authorization Act signed by Trump last month.

But the defense purchases in the legislation must still be funded by an appropriations omnibus bill that has yet to materialize in Congress.

White House officials and the Big Four congressional leaders met Wednesday evening about raising annual caps on defense and nondefense spending. Despite some optimism, no deal was reached and much of the NDAA remains in limbo.

The next-generation Virginia-class submarines are used to hunt enemy ships and submarines as well as attack coastal targets and deliver special operations forces.

“Fast-attack submarines remain one of the most effective and sought after tools in our nation’s arsenal,” lawmakers wrote in their Dec. 21 letter.

The subs are built by General Dynamics in Groton, Conn., and by Huntington Ingalls at Newport News, Va. The letter to appropriators was signed and released by Reps. Joe Courtney, D-Conn.; Jim Langevin, D-R.I.; and Rob Wittman, R-Va.

They warned that the Navy eventually wants a fleet of 66 submarines and, under the president’s budget request to keep building two per year, it would not meet that goal until 2048. The fleet could also reach a low point of 41 as older subs are retired.",http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/house-lawmakers-worry-budget-talks-could-nix-a-hike-in-navy-attack-subs/article/2645009,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

6353,7275,Uncovering the Obama Conspiracies,"Our worst suspicions about Barack Obama are coming true. He is not a centrist as he claimed to be. He is a leftist, and he is destroying our way of life. Obama could be perpetrating the greatest fraud in American history. He could be an illegitimate president, and one who intentionally seeks to undermine our country. By the time the truth comes out, the damage to may be irreparable.

Barack Obama’s meteoric rise to power has been truly remarkable. He served a mere 143 days in the U.S. Senate prior to forming an exploratory committee for his presidential candidacy in 2007. He has risen from obscurity to celebrity status in a very short time.

With the multitude of mysteries that surround him, it is a wonder why there has not been the interest in investigating his personal history and nefarious connections at, say, a fraction of the interest of what followed John F. Kennedy’s assassination.

The decades of controversy that followed the JFK assassination amounted to nothing more than a misfit named Lee Harvey Oswald acting alone to kill the president. That’s it. There was nothing more to it. No grassy knoll snipers, no mob connection, no Castro connection, no KGB connection, no CIA connection, nothing.

In the end, the investigations into the conspiracies about the JFK assassination were much ado about nothing. The Warren Commission had it right from the beginning. With the multitude of conspiracies pertaining to Obama, however, it is more aptly described as nothing ado about much. Where is Oliver Stone when you need him?

Is Barack Obama some sort of 21st Century Manchurian Candidate writ large? What do we really know about him? Let us start at the beginning.

The Early Years

Barack Obama is alleged to be born in both Hawaii and Kenya. His mother, Stanley Ann Dunham, was a student attending the University of Hawaii when she met Barack Obama, Sr., a foreign student from Kenya, in 1960. Obama’s mother and father were married on February 2, 1961. She would later learn that the father was already married, and they separated in 1963.

Barack Obama claims to be born on August 4, 1961 in Hawaii as a natural born citizen and is therefore eligible to be president. His grandmother, Sarah Obama, says she witnessed his birth in Kenya. Even if this is not true, his father was a British citizen making his son a dual, or “naturalized” citizen. The U.S. Constitution reads that a presidential candidate must be “a natural born,” not just a “naturalized” citizen. The Certificate of Live Birth Obama released appears to have been photoshopped, and nonetheless is not an official birth certificate.

In 1967, Anna married Lolo Soetoro, a Malaysian oilman, and moved from Hawaii to Indonesia. Young Obama was enrolled in preschool in Jakarta under the name “Barry Soetoro” and was registered as a citizen of Indonesia and his religion as Islam. Obama’s stepfather was a Muslim, and Indonesia law requires all children to be citizens (or renounce prior citizenship) to attend school. Obama’s mother Anna left him and he never saw her again after 1979.

From 1970 to 1979, Obama attended a private school in Hawaii. During these years, Obama was mentored by Frank Marshall Davis, his grandfather’s friend. Davis has even been rumored to be Obama’s father. Davis wrote for the Honolulu Record (a Communist newspaper) and was a member of the Communist Party USA.



In 1979, Obama was admitted to Occidental College in Los Angeles, most likely as a foreign exchange student. By this time, he was already moving down the path to becoming a socialist activist. At Occidental, he was a member of the radical socialist organization Students for Economic Democracy until he transferred to Columbia University in 1981.

There are many unanswered questions about the Obama’s early years. Diana West and John L. Work compiled a list of undisclosed documents on Obama’s background that we, as an open society, have a right to know about the man who currently occupies the White House.

1) The original, long-form 1961 Hawaiian birth certificate.

2) Marriage license between Obama’s father (Barack Sr.) and mother (Stanley Ann Dunham) — not found, not released

3) Obama’s baptism records — sealed

4) Obama’s adoption records — sealed

5) Records of Obama’s and his mother’s repatriation as US citizens on return from Indonesia — not found, not released

6) Name change (Barry Soetero to Barack Hussein Obama) records — not found, not released

7) Noelani Elementary School (Hawaii) — not released

Punahou School financial aid or school records — not released

9) Occidental College financial aid records — not released. (These records were, however, subpoenaed but Obama lawyers succeeded in quashing the subpoena in court. No other Occidental records have been released.)

10) Columbia College records — not released

11) Columbia senior thesis — not released

12) Harvard Law School records (not mentioned below, but not released)

13) Obama’s law client list — sealed

14) Obama’s files from career as an Illinois State Senator — sealed

15) Obama’s record with Illinois State Bar Association — sealed

16) Obama’s medical records — not released

17) Obama’s passport records — not released

And I will add two more . . .

18) Obama’s 1979 Selective Service Registration.

19) Obama’s true Social Security Number. He is alleged to have more than one.

The Road to the Presidency

In 1983, Obama moved to Chicago where he became Director of the Developing Communities Project where he honed his community organizing skills. In the mid-1980s, Obama was the attorney for ACORN and was a trainer at their annual conferences.

Obama first met William Ayers in 1988. Soon afterwards, Obama returns east to attend Harvard Law School. A wealthy Saudi prince is rumored to have funded his tuition. Obama then became the first black president of the Harvard Law Review. For such an ordinary writer, this is amazing too. Other than an unremarkable article published in the Columbia student newspaper, we don’t find anything he has written up to this time, including in the Harvard Law Review.

Obama returned to Chicago to intern at a law firm in 1989 where he met Michelle Robinson. Following graduation, he and Michelle were married in 1992 by Rev. Jeremiah Wright at the Trinity United Church of Christ.

In 1995, Dreams from My Father was published. Jack Cashill has analyzed the writing style of the book and concluded that it is remarkably similar to other books written by William Ayers. Apparently, Ayers made the effort to ghostwrite the book in 1995 because he and his contacts already had Obama on the fast track to run for high office, and through him advance their radical agenda.

And where else would that be possible but in the machine politics of Chicago? Obama and Ayers served alongside each other on a $100 million education foundation called the “Chicago Annenberg Challenge” from 1995 to 2000. When Obama launched his political career in 1995, the setting for his first fundraiser was the Chicago apartment of Ayers. Obama was the winning candidate for the Illinois 13th District in 1996.

In 2004, Obama ran for and won the U.S. Senate seat for Illinois after his GOP opponent was exposed in a sex scandal. On February 10, 2007, the young Senator announced his presidential candidacy. Senator Obama voted the liberal line on 65 of 66 key votes and he was ranked as “the most liberal Senator of 2007” by the National Journal.

Obama lived by the Alinsky rule that said radicals should cut their hair and put on suits so as not to scare off the middle class. This approach served Obama well through the 2008 “Change We Can Believe In” campaign. And during that campaign, he took down the Clinton machine, which in itself was no small feat. A messianic quality soon surrounded Obama as a fawning media gushed over the spectacle of the first black man seriously contending for the presidency.

As a citizen of the world and a candidate for the presidency, Obama gave a landmark speech in Berlin where he promised to not leave “our children a world where the oceans rise and famine spreads and terrible storms devastate our lands.” Even by Obama’s inflated rhetorical standards, this was over the top.

Six weeks before the election, the subprime mortgage crisis forced Lehman Brothers into bankruptcy, and the stock market subsequently lost 25% of its value over the next month. It has never been determined whether Obama’s backers, such as George Soros, were complicit in the market crash in 2008. But it all fits together so nicely by their profiting while short selling the market and panicking the public to the point that they would consider an unknown leftist Senator for the highest office in the land. The crash essentially handed the presidency to Barack Obama.

The Unfolding Truth

Imagine if it were ever proven that Obama is ineligible to be president. A Constitutional crisis would surely erupt. The validity of every law and Executive Order signed while Obama was acting as president could be invalidated.

Every day we witness another assault by Team Obama to alter our country and grow a culture of dependency. From coercing corporations into adopting progressive policies, to politicizing the census, to seeking to make millions of illegal aliens into voting citizens, to establishing an Internet Kill Switch, to abolishing talk radio, to Cap and Trade, to ObamaCare, the list goes on. The implications of these schemes are grave for freedom loving people everywhere. In Obama’s Alinksyite world, the end always justifies the means. It just comes with an alibi and a smile.

Obama’s runaway spending and anti-business policies could be to purposely driving the nation into bankruptcy. The U.S. economy is already staggering under a mountain of debt and unfunded liabilities. Could Obama’s end game be to sabotage the U.S. and world economies in order to collapse them and create the New World Order that progressives have long sought? We may soon find out. There is already talk of a single world currency as the value of the dollar erodes.

In summary, Barack Obama played down his radical past to appear moderate. Everything the man stands for and has ever done, however, is some deception or lie. He promised to transform our nation with a fresh start. In the time since we have known this man, however, it is clear that his only answer to anything is more government control. He will say or pretend anything to advance that goal.

The president and his socialist brethren are intent on undermining our allegiance to the U.S. Constitution. In 2008, the people were duped into voting for a con man for their president. Now, our very way of life is at risk and the time to correct this deception grows short. We need to expose the truth behind the Obama Administration and its backers before it is too late.

After a bit of sweating on both sides, it appears an agreement to reopen the government has been reached.

According to the Washington Examiner, Senate Democrats are willing to agree to a vote on a bill that will kick in and keep the government open until February 8.

“I think it’ll be open by what? 12:10? 12:15?” Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said ahead of planned Senate vote to end the shutdown. “We’re going to reopen the government,” added Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va. He said Democrats have assurances from Republicans that they will try to tackle immigration once the government is reopened, but they didn’t fully describe the promises made.

Something that should have been agreed to in the beginning, actually.

The announcement comes after a caucus meeting with Senate Democrats.

Senator Angus King (I-Maine) is also on board with this new bill.

Now, back to your usually scheduled bickering and stalling.

41,51,"If You Use Essential Oils And Own A Cat, There’s A Deadly Warning You Need To Hear","This will not stop the Facebook sellers of the oil defending their product despite mounting evidence. Even though essential oils have been around for so long, it is only recently that the products have become super popular commercial items thanks to marketing initiatives that target interested consumers. It is almost like people did not read the small print on these bottles and make the connection that maybe the oils are harmful to pets like cats who have much weaker constitutions.

We can’t blame people for being into essential oils. Essential oils are usually naturally-derived and offer a potential cure for stress and other potential challenges. The current crop of companies on Facebook selling essential oils are making some claims that really have no basis in fact. Claims that essential oils can help you lose weight or keep your house clean are convincing a lot of people to invest in these products without realizing that it is personal drive and work ethic that will actually help them lose weight and keep a tidy house.

Two of the biggest companies are Young Living Essential Oils and DoTerra, which has recruited over 3 million sellers since it’s launch on 2008.

In any event, customers are taking to Facebook to offer their concerns after a Mom posted about how she accidentally poisoned her cat with an essential oil spray.

Sue Murray, who lives in Michigan, posted that her daughter’s cat Ernie did not take well to the spray. She was using a Eucalyptus spray she bought on Amazon in her bedroom because she read somewhere that it helped with congestion. All it seems to have done is make 16-year old Ernie feel sick.

“The first couple days I didn’t notice any symptoms with Ernie, but on the fourth day, he was lethargic, unstable on his feet and he was drooling excessively.”

It was only then that her husband looked up eucalyptus and realized it can be fatal for cats. They rushed Ernie to the vet and made sure he got the attention he needed.

“The vet gave him a shot of antibiotics and another shot of vitamins to boost him and instructions to watch him over the weekend,” according to Sue. She went on to add that “Ernie has not been himself. He is eating and drinking a little, walking a little better, has some diarrhea, but is still not out of the woods.”

Of course, it goes without saying that Sue was not informed of these risks by the company she bought from. Her post has been shared over 700,000 times and points to a general concern amongst consumers that information is lacking in the essential oils they buy.

The reaction from companies has been just as swift as the complaints brought about after Sue’s post. Many of these companies claim their products are safe to use around pets, and that it is really a rare case for an essential oil to harmful. One of the bigger companies, DoTerra, even went so far as accusing Sue of buying cheap oils!",http://awm.com/if-you-use-essential-oils-and-own-a-cat-theres-a-deadly-warning-you-need-to-here/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
4997,5646,Libertarian Republican Sen. Jeff Flake Will Not Run for Re-Election (UPDATED),"Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

Republican Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, known for his libertarian leanings and more recently for his critique of President Donald Trump’s behavior, announced today he will not be running for re-election next year.

He will serve out the rest of his term, but he told the Arizona Republic, “there may not be a place for a Republican like me in the current Republican climate or the current Republican Party.”

He explained further that he simply could not toe the line with the president’s restrictionist attitudes on trade and immigration:

“Here’s the bottom line: The path that I would have to travel to get the Republican nomination is a path I’m not willing to take, and that I can’t in good conscience take,” Flake told The Republic in a telephone interview. “It would require me to believe in positions I don’t hold on such issues as trade and immigration and it would require me to condone behavior that I cannot condone.”

He’s giving speech on the Senate floor this afternoon (at the time of this blog post, actually). The Arizona Republic got a copy of his prepared statement:

“We must never regard as ‘normal’ the regular and casual undermining of our democratic norms and ideals,” Flake says in his remarks as prepared for delivery. “We must never meekly accept the daily sundering of our country — the personal attacks, the threats against principles, freedoms, and institutions, the flagrant disregard for truth or decency, the reckless provocations, most often for the pettiest and most personal reasons, reasons having nothing whatsoever to do with the fortunes of the people that we have all been elected to serve.

UPDATE: Here is the full text of Flake’s remarks

UPDATE II: CNN has posted the video of the Senate speech online:

Huge Breaking News!! Three independent news journalists—including youtube sensation WeAreChange— received an exclusive look inside the 2015 Bilderbergs meeting place the Interalpen-Hotel Tyrol in Austria. One of the journalists booked the hotel room in advanced and somehow happened to make their way into the hotel room for check-in and shockingly allowed past security checkpoints. While they were there they gather exclusive footage of the hotel rooms, the hotel itself, as well as one of the conference centers in the hotel. Shortly after their arrival and filming of the hotel, hotel security performed a background check on one of the journalists and after their findings they were escorted out with a “parting gift” ….

9501,10727,Gallup: Congress Approval Rating Sinks To Historic Low,"Source: www.infowars.com | Original Post Date: June 19, 2014 –

Just when you thought it couldn’t go any lower, the approval rating for Congress among Americans has hit an all time low, according to a new Gallup poll.

The number of Americans who now have “a great deal” or “quite a lot” of confidence in Congress as an institution stands at a paltry 7 percent. Just 4 percent have a “great deal” of confidence, while only 3 percent say they have “quite a lot” of confidence.

The figure marks a three percent drop on last year from 10 percent, and is a historic low point.

Gallup has charted the demise in confidence Americans have in their elected representatives since 1973 when the approval figure stood at 42 percent. since that time there has been a steady downward lurch.

“Americans’ current confidence in Congress is not only the lowest on record, but also the lowest Gallup has recorded for any institution in the 41-year trend.” the pollster reports.

“This is also the first time Gallup has ever measured confidence in a major U.S. institution in the single digits.” the Gallup report continues.

Only around a third of Americans say they have “some” confidence, while approximately 50 percent have “very little,” with another 7% stating that they have “none” at all.

With more government scandals than you can shake a stick at, and pending further involvement in military mire in the Middle East, Americans clearly feel that Congress is utterly failing to represent their views and wishes on Capitol Hill.

Gallup also noted that of 17 institutions it measured this year, Congress came rock bottom in terms of confidence status with Americans. The criminal justice system, the healthcare system, the police, and even banks all ranked much higher.

“The dearth of public confidence in their elected leaders on Capitol Hill is yet another sign of the challenges that could face incumbents in 2014′s midterm elections — as well as more broadly a challenge to the broad underpinnings of the nation’s representative democratic system.” Gallup concludes.

Earlier this year, a Rasmussen poll indicated that a record number of Americans believe that Congress will always find a way to make things worse, no matter how terrible the country’s prospects become.

According to the poll, a three year high of 69% believe that their elected representatives are capable of being even poorer at their jobs.

America’s elected representatives are also still viewed in a worse light than zombies, witches, dog poop, potholes, toenail fungus, and hemorrhoids. Congress also still ranks less popular than cockroaches, lice, root canals, colonoscopies, traffic jams, used car salesmen, Genghis Khan, Communism, North Korea, BP during the Gulf Oil Spill, or Nixon during Watergate.

Given that historians estimate between 15 and 20 percent of the European-American population of the colonies were Loyalists during the the American Revolution, it means that King George coveted close to three times as much support as Congress has today.

How low can Congress go?

8401,9505,The Safer Streets Gun Owner Survey Results,"The Safer Streets Gun Owner Survey runs throughout the month of April. Early results are beginning to level off and come to a halt. Anyone who wishes to take the survey can access it here . Firefox browser seems to work best.

The survey was sent to determine whether there was any correspondence between gun owners who also know CPR. As for myself, I have always seen a clear correlation of the immediacy, latitude, moral purpose and public interest between the armed citizen and citizen CPR. The idea is all about being in the absence of first responders.

Over the years, I began to see more correlations until I saw a very clear identity of values and purpose between the two. For the most part, they are identical twelve ways.

If there was any answer for the welcome and normalcy of the ubiquitous armed citizen in the U.S., it was going to have to show a history of worth. If gun owners know CPR as part of their outlook and values system, this would be a powerful thing to establish. Another one would be how well right-to-carry states have fared since affirming the armed citizen.

The second question was why. If they understood the identity of values as I understood them, what, exactly, was it we were in agreement on? The question was open-ended and the response was in their own words. I’ll go into the open-ended answers later.

The survey was comprised of sixteen questions, some of which (like Question #2) were peripheral to the core interrogatory. Question Number One asked if the respondent is a gun owner. 98.6% of those who took the survey are gun owners.

Here is the core question. Having established that 98.6% of those responding are gun owners, Question #3 was: Do you know CPR [Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation] and First-aid?

78.5% of the respondents answered Yes, they know CPR. 21.3% said that they did not.

Ah, but I provided respondents the opportunity to reply with their own comments. 32% elected to furnish details, which is a mix of the Yes and No respondents. Mostly, those who commented and had answered Yes, they know CPR wrote that they had taken the primary training in the past or remarked that they’re currently certified or not certified One of the things among the remarks is that many are professional medical people. 9% are. Among the respondents who are gun owners are those who said they are nurse or nursing student, EMT, a Firefighter EMT, a Paramedic, Police Officers and others. Among the open-ended responses among the non-medical respondents were “I feel it is part of good citizenship,” and another posted “Everyone should.” Other remarks were just as encouraging on the morality of learning both how to handle a gun and how to deliver CPR or First-aid. One of the things I enjoyed discovering was the idea of good citizenship among the open-ended responses. One of my perspectives is that gun owners are strict adherents to due process. The question was how do I prove it?

Of those who answered No, they have not taken CPR, a funny sort of apology was evident. Some of the responses were that they knew they should but haven’t, while others wrote something like they will complete CPR training.

59% of the respondents are non-medical people and 9% are medical professionals.

My main purpose in conducting this survey was to establish whether others viewed a similarity of importance as I had. My conclusion is that they have and they do. My reason for articulating the CPR Corollary is to bring this concept to the laymen. To us, it is evident, but to the laymen who feel that they grapple with a controversy in the armed citizen, here is another facet which takes the controversy out of the issue. The controversy has been whether gun owners can be trusted to be armed. I am of the mind that they can be trusted because they already are possessed of good judgment and a value for life. This value for life may seem somehow incongruous with being armed, but when the layman begins to see how the two save more lives than thought, you wonder how one could arrive at anything different.

I’ll be sifting through the other results throughout April. A new survey will be out soon exploring some very critical issues seeking gun owner perspectives. As you might imagine, these are rather well known to gun owners, but perhaps new to the layman.

You never know who may be hearing the liberty message for the very first time. They key to being armed, the reason we are armed, can be reduced to an equitable concept: it is a matter of freedom as a matter of survival, because you are the only person you can really count on in the first moments of an emergency.

78.5% of the gun owners surveyed know CPR. Nice.

Next, the balance of the survey results. Do gun owners view CPR as part of a larger preparedness? And Guns on Campus.",http://canadafreepress.com/print_friendly/the-safer-streets-gun-owner-survey-results,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
8932,10115,Bernie Sanders puts the blame for the shutdown on Mitch McConnell,"Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said the government shutdown is on Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s shoulders because he brought a bill to the Senate floor that he knew couldn’t pass.

Sanders said on CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday that McConnell knew he would have to get 60 votes on the continuing resolution to keep the government open for four weeks. However, McConnell knew that bill wasn’t going to get support from the full Republican Senate caucus, let alone the nine Democrats that would have had to jump partisan lines to advance the bill.

“Let's be clear, and I know people are sick and tired of the blame game, and I understand that. But here is the reality. It takes 60 votes in the United States Senate to get anything done,” Sanders said to host Jake Tapper.

“The other night, Mitch McConnell walked on to the floor of the Senate, and he knows the rules better than anybody. He did not have 60 votes. He barely had 50 votes. When you're in that situation, Jake, what it requires, and what we should be doing, is negotiating.”

Senate Democrats have complained they’ve been excluded from much of the legislative negotiations since Republicans took control of the government in January 2017.

While there were bipartisan negotiations leading up to the shutdown Saturday morning, Democrats were not willing to vote for a bill that didn’t include protections for about 800,000 illegal immigrants brought to this country as children, known as Dreamers.

President Trump ended the federal program that protects those Dreamers from being deported, but delayed it until March 5. Sanders said it’s time now for lawmakers to figure out a solution before that deadline comes and goes.

“The wall was a great idea in the 15th century when the Chinese built the Great China Wall,” Sanders said. “I don't think it makes a whole lot of sense now, but I'm willing to sit down in a room and do what the American people want and what the American people want is to provide legal status to the Dreamers and a path toward citizenship. Let's sit down and do that.”",http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/bernie-sanders-puts-the-blame-for-the-shutdown-on-mitch-mcconnell/article/2646607,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
8699,9852,Thank God for Conservative Women,"Subscribe to Canada Free Press for FREE

Liberal women continually poke, poke, poke at the foundations of America, or whatever country has the misfortune to house them, I thank God for confident, patriotic, self-reliant conservative women. I salute all conservative women

Thank God for Conservative Women

Dare to speak out [conservatively]? When you’re black? When you’re an actress? When you’re a woman? There goes your social life—Stacy Dash “There Goes My Social Life: From Clueless to Conservative” At the outset let me say that in my opinion liberals have come up with any number of good ideas in the past, and I like to give credit where it’s due—but it should also be noted that liberals are notorious for running good ideas into the ground. It is a truism, one that perhaps goes unappreciated by most of us, that a virtue taken to an extreme can become a vice. For example, the virtue of patience taken to an extreme becomes procrastination; caution and concern morph into fear and anxiety, politeness becomes obsequiousness, moderate liberals turn into leftist nitwits, and so on. Moderation, (what Buddha called “The Middle Way”), appears to be a key element of a happy, healthy, sane existence.

...extremes ought not to be practiced by one who has gone forth from the household life….There is addiction to indulgence of sense-pleasures, which is low, coarse, the way of ordinary people, unworthy, and unprofitable; and there is addiction to self-mortification, which is painful, unworthy, and unprofitable. Avoiding both these extremes, the Perfect One has realized the Middle Path; it gives vision, gives knowledge, and leads to calm, to insight, to enlightenment….—Buddha “Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta” Let your moderation be known to all men.—Philippians 4:5 NKJV But enough about moderation, and the liberal lack thereof. Let me get into the meat of this article by pointing out that, generally speaking, liberal women don’t do well when left to think on their own—such un-herd-like behavior is discouraged among the collectivist milieu. Like docile cows, liberal women go where they are told. “This way Betsy, that a girl.” They are told where to go via the same propaganda venues as their friends (NPR, NY Times, LA Times, WaPo, etc.) and the herd moves as one. It’s the cookie-cutter mentality of the collectivist—be they communist, fascist, globalist, or whatever. The realization that the collectivist model always ends in bloodshed and failure seems to be beyond the individual cow’s ability to comprehend—or perhaps they have an unconscious compulsion to visit the slaughterhouse. Whatever. Women (liberal women) are of course a “protected species” under the rules of Identity Politics (one of the more asinine gambits of liberaltopia), which posits the quaint if absurd proposition that a person is praiseworthy simply because of their gender (or lack thereof), skin color, sexual proclivities, or breakfast cereal preference. But God help you if you are Caucasian, because if you are, then you are automatically saddled with the shameful burden of “white privilege”—shame, shame on you. To understand, that is to fully grok, this groovy sounding if vile racist phrase is apparently beyond the liberal female’s capacity to process—poor dears. (Perhaps something of a moot point, as liberals are rapidly approaching the time when they can safely dispense with women altogether).

Tolerance of intolerance is cowardice When males can become females simply by clicking their ruby shoes together and wishing it, liberal women are told to shut up and get with the program—regardless of the fact that such males now have an outrageous advantage in “women’s” sports. When liberal women feel inclined to question the wisdom of letting every Tom, Dick, and Harry use the women’s bathroom, strip and change clothes alongside them in the locker-room, and share their showers while naked…they are told to shut up and get with the program. Feminists seem oddly supportive of these assaults on women’s rights—“I am woman…or whatever...hear me roar!” As I say, wherever they are prodded to go the herd goes. And make no mistake, liberal females have been prodded to keep their mouths shut and keep any doubts to themselves regarding these assaults on their gender. “Shut up and get with the program!” Our “educational” system is largely in charge of their initial programming. Brandeis University reneged on giving an honorary degree to the uncommonly articulate and brave woman Ayaan Hirsi Ali because the truth she told regarding her experiences with Islam made liberal women uncomfortable. It did not align with the official politically correct narrative, which creates an uncomfortable feeling of cognitive dissonance in liberal women. “Quick, where’s the nearest safe space! La, la, la, I CAN’T HEAR YOU!” People ask me if I have some kind of death wish, to keep saying the things I do. The answer is no: I would like to keep living. However, some things must be said, and there are times when silence becomes an accomplice to injustice. Tolerance of intolerance is cowardice.—Ayaan Hirsi Ali Or as Dietrich Bonhoeffer (who died in a Nazi concentration camp) put it: “Silence in the face of evil is itself evil.” Brandeis, to its lasting shame, punished Ms. Ali for speaking truth to power. But in liberaltopia truth is considered hate speech—as numerous conservative women can attest to after being shouted down, threatened, and told to shut up at numerous indoctrination centers (AKA college campuses) across America. Free speech is not welcome in liberaltopia. If what you say is not in alignment with the official liberal narrative you will be silenced, with violence if necessary. A growing number of Trump supporters have come to understand just how intolerant the Left truly is—and the Trump supporter’s “crime” isn’t even speaking truth, it’s merely listening to truth. I long ago lost any respect I had for the feminist movement due to their near total silence regarding the more misogynistic elements in Islam. Liberal feminists were told to keep quiet about such things and they have meekly submitted. Female genital mutilation, child brides, being treated as worthless chattel or pampered pets? The feminist’s answer to these and similar practices is crickets chirping. Code Pink showed the way—no matter what the provocation never, never, NEVER criticize Islam in any way, shape, or form! Thank God for strong, courageous, conservative women like Pamella Geller, Brigitte Gabriel, and the late martyr for truth Oriana Fallaci. Speaking of Code Pink—according to an article by Baron Bodissey, because of the frequency and number of assaults on women by Muslim “immigrants” a German city is proposing Code Pink Lady Zones on their buses: As you all know, culturally enriched incidents of sexual harassment, molestation, and rape have reached epidemic proportions in German cities. A city councillor in Regensburg has decided to get serious about protecting his city’s women, and is proposing a tough, no-nonsense solution to the issue of sexual violence by refugees: he wants to establish women-only zones on city buses. And mark them in pink, in case any of the would-be molesters are unable to read German, English, Arabic, Turkish, Urdu, Swahili, etc. “Make your way to the pink area at the back of the bus ladies!” Shades of Jim Crow—you’ve come a long way baby…not. I suppose such a proposal is a step up from the female mayor (liberal need I add) of Cologne, Germany who chastised women assault victims for provoking their attackers by walking too close to them. Bad girls—but apparently not as bad as they are in Sweden. Sweden is now Europe’s rape capital, thanks to a massive influx of “refugees.” In fact, Sweden is in the running to become the rape capital of the world. It is currently in 2nd place, but give the liberal Swedish media and political elites half a chance and they’ll be sure to garner the coveted #1 spot in no time. They must covet becoming the rape capital of the world or else how do you explain their callous disregard for the safety of Swedish women, and the liberal Swedish women’s meek acquiescence to their status as sexual prey? An article by Daniel Greenfield notes that “1 in 4 Swedish Women Will Be Raped as Sexual Assaults Increase 500%.” Very bad girls indeed. The lunacy of the Left ofttimes leaves me scratching my head in wonder. For example, I have read several reports of European women apologizing for being raped by Muslim “immigrants.” How pathetically twisted is that! Apologizing to the man (or men) who beat and sexually abused you? Jesus wept. One German rape victim wrote: “You [the Muslim rapist] are not safe because we live in a racist society.” She then went on to say that she was not safe because she lived in a sexist society. Note the typical liberal leitmotif of always pointing an accussing finger away from oneself, and never taking personal responsibility for anything negative that happens to them. It is always his fault, her fault, their fault, society’s fault—NEVER their fault. Personal reponsibility is a foreign concept that does not compute. The jarring lack of self-esteem and self-respect that these women’s wretched attitudes imply is frightening. What kind of warped female psyches has liberalism wrought?

In a recent article by Jasper Hamill titled “(Trigger warning): Meet ‘Generation Snowflake’—the hysterical young women who can’t cope with being offended” he quotes Claire Fox as saying: We need a younger generation that’s prepared to grow a backbone, go out into the world, take risks and make difficult decisions. Otherwise the future doesn’t bode well for any of us. Is it really any wonder that the precious little snowflakes are so screwed up? The unrelentingly negative nit-pick-pick-picking of Critical Theory all but guarantees that they will be ashamed of their country (or at least not proud of it); eco-nuts assure them that they are a blight upon the earth whose every poisonous breath damages nature; science-fiction TV shows and movies tell them that in the “enlightened” future the status of women will have sunk to the point where they have to co-opt masculine honorifics in order to command respect—“Yes sir. Right away sir!” Secular humanism and moral relativism leave them with no moral compass to steer by—indeed no direction to steer toward except ultimately nihilism and suicidal despair. Multiculturalism teaches them that no person, no society, is better or worse than another—the Marquis de Sade is on a par with Mother Teresa; Caligula with Gandhi. Last but not least, liberal women are proudly supporting a woman for president who is a world-class liar under investigation by the FBI and known for enabling a serial sexual predator for decades. Woo hoo! How proud liberal women must be. (Say, did anyone happen to find that six billion dollars that went missing from the State Department during Hillary’s watch? “Oh that little thing?” Yes, that one). I could go on ad nauseum listing the pathology of liberal women, but you get the idea. I suppose I could (reluctantly) applaud their ability to keep their heads from exploding due to severe cognitive dissonance, but I consider that to be a dubious achievement at best. Granted, balancing supercilious arrogance with professional victimhood might appear at first blush to be an impressive feat, but once you realize that they have been socially engineered to function that way the shine loses its luster. It’s simply the way they’ve been programed. As I watch liberal women continually poke, poke, poke at the foundations of America, or whatever country has the misfortune to house them, I thank God for confident, patriotic, self-reliant conservative women. I salute all conservative women, your free spirits are beautiful!

9466,10690,Fishing Fleet at MH370 Site has Disappeared Except For Vessel With Likely False Location,"Fishing Fleet at MH370 Site has Disappeared Except For Vessel With Likely False Location

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

Vessels in the Fu Yuan Yu fleet previously seen near the MH370 search site suddenly disappeared from our monitoring system last week as the entire fleet and associated fishing gear stopped broadcasting AIS. One of the vessels has now reappeared, the Fu Yuan Yu 076 is giving a current location in the Bay of Bengal near India. However looking at the vessel’s track over the past three months there is good reason to be skeptical. While the vessel showed a likely fishing track they appeared in a very unlikely location, the mountains of Tibet.

What we see is in fact a latitude reversal where a vessel’s position in the Southern Hemisphere is flipped over the Equator to appear in the Northern Hemisphere. This is one of a number of patterns of false AIS locations we have documented. We’re not sure if these simply result from errors in transmission or if the vessel operator intends to make his vessel difficult to track. Fortunately we have developed some tools to pick these false locations out of our data and correct them. In this case we’re very confident this vessel was fishing in the Southern Indian Ocean with the rest of the Fu Yuan Yu fleet.

The vessel’s latest positions show them moving on an irregular course at slow speed so it’s possible that they have resumed fishing at this new location. Though we can’t see any of the other vessels in the Fu Yuan Yu fleet there is a good chance they are nearby. We’ll see if any of them reappear in the next few days.

The track of the Fu Yuan Yu 076 over the past three months. While the vessel has been broadcasting a impossible position on land in the Northern Hemisphere their true location can be found by flipping the track over the Equator. This placed the vessel with the rest of the Fu Yuan Yu fleet in the Southern Indian Ocean. Currently this is the only one of the vessels we have a position for so this may indicate that the whole fleet has moved north.

In the video below Gary Franchi at the Next News Network reveals stunning information about a rare discover found in a ghost ship that was floating 40 miles off the shore.

Two fishermen discover the ship in the seas of Surigao del Sur province, 50 miles off the Philippines. When the men climbed aboard they found photo albums, clothes, tins of food strewn, paperwork, and a its mummified ship captain, Fritz Bajorat.

The grey corpse was preserved by the dry ocean winds, hot temperatures, and salty air and was discovered sitting at a desk near radio equipment.

At this time it’s not clear how he died, but no one has see him since 2009. A few theories on his death include foul play and a heart attack.

Here is more on this breaking report…

8089,9174,2017: The year angry populists rose to the top — and fell on their faces,"Among the nearly 250 years of American politics, 2017 will stand out, along with 1829 (when Andrew Jackson was sworn in), as a moment when populists didn’t merely rattle the political establishment, but actually won a national election and gained real political power.

And 2017 will also stand as a year in which the populists most proximate to political power fell flat on their faces. The problem isn’t populism per se. The problem is that much of the populism accompanying (and also powering) Donald Trump’s rise has been purely negative — vacuous populism whose beginning, middle, and end is inchoate anger at the “establishment.”

Just in the past week, some of the vacuous populists have revealed the emptiness and ultimate impotence of their anger.

In 2016, Paul Nehlen challenged House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin in the Republican congressional primary and gathered outsized attention from the angry populist corners of the Internet. He lost by more than 70 points. In December 2017, Nehlen, planning to challenge Ryan again, outed himself as a blatant anti-semite and racist, reflecting what was obvious to anyone who followed his run against Ryan: There was not an ounce of conservatism in him or his run against Ryan; there was only anger.

Related: The populist Right's Paul Nehlen problem

Milo Yiannopoulos was a favorite provocateur of the same angry populist wing. A vulgarian and contrarian, Yiannopoulos was little more, as became glaringly obvious to anyone who read the manuscript of his book, which Simon & Schuster had commissioned and then spiked. Staring at his own physique in the mirror is probably the most fitting part of the book. Too often, the populism on today’s Right amounts to little more than admiring one’s own refusal to be cowed by political correctness — or by human decency.

Roy Moore was the favorite anti-establishment populist candidate in 2017. Running against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and “the swamp,” Moore beat appointed incumbent Sen. Luther Strange in Alabama’s Republican primary, but then amazingly lost the Senate seat to a Democrat after revelations of his proclivities for younger women and credible, largely verified reports of sexual assault.

That so many “conservatives” stuck with Moore after he was outed as a pervert by detailed and corroborated reporting revealed either a paranoid hatred and distrust of the media establishment or a moral sense so weak it was bulldozed by tribalism.

The man behind all of these angry populist figures is Steve Bannon. Bannon was something of a muse for Trump during the campaign, translating Trump’s eclectic and non-ideological views into something almost coherent: a nationalist populism. Bannon, of course, was drummed from the White House, lost his effort to elect Moore, and now has been forced to forswear Nehlen.

There’s a lesson in the collapse of these Bannonite populists, and it is a central political moral of 2017.

The lesson isn’t that populism is always bad, or that it can never fit with conservatism. At times, the Tea Party embodied intelligent conservative populism, because it saw populism as a stance and sentiment that could be put to the service of conservative goals, such as smaller government, local control, and defense of family and community.

Populism can provide the energy to battle corporate welfare queens, decadent cultural elites, and power-hungry hubristic centralizers. Populism can put a bit of a democratic scare into an establishment too comfy in the swampy world of the revolving door and self-dealing.

But a populism directed at goals and constrained by principles is not the right-wing populism we got. We got instead a populism that could only destroy. Every target it took down just meant the movement had to find the next enemy. If the Tea Party began by going after Charlie Crist and Arlen Specter, it moved on to Bob Bennett and Trey Grayson, and then Dick Lugar and David Dewhurst.

Then John Boehner — the most conservative House speaker in generations — had to go. Then Paul Ryan instantly became the totem of the establishment. Jeb Bush was a squish and Scott Walker was a sellout. Marco Rubio — a Tea Partier by political pedigree and a conservative by any definition — was basically Specter by 2015. Even Ted Cruz became “too establishment.”

With Trump’s inauguration this year, this destruction-only populism gained real power. And with nothing left to destroy, it took down itself.",http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/2017-the-year-angry-populists-rose-to-the-top-and-fell-on-their-faces/article/2644533,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

A man’s sister told him a group of boaters witnessed an aerial explosion offshore around 8:00 a.m. last Saturday morning

SOUTH PACIFIC (INTELLIHUB) — A man posted a video to YouTube on Sunday in which he claims his sister, who lives on Maui, heard that a group of 9 tour boat guides and about 13 tourists witnessed some type of explosion in the sky about 100 NM offshore (leeward side.)

“They said it looked like a meteor and then all of a sudden it was a big boom and it lit up the entire sky,” he explained. “It was at eight o’clock in the morning.”

“Maybe this wasn’t a drill after all,” he said. “I would think that the United States would not want to cause more panic if they did launch something at Hawaii — they would say it was a mistake.”

The man also maintains that the story was posted by a local news outlet for a short period of time before it was “pulled” altogether.

7292,8307,Romney Needs To Articulate His Plans For Dealing With Interest On Our Debt,"So, here we are. It is four years after “Hope and Change”. That slogan proved to only be more psychobabble from a babbling fool who rode the saying right into the White House.

The economy is struggling. As a result, interest rates have been kept artificially low to prevent the United States’ debt situation from blowing up. This has been done for one reason and one reason only: to keep President Obama from looking like the complete nincompoop that he is. And that’s it isn’t it? That’s the big, old elephant in the room that no one wants to talk about: what happens when things turn around and we no longer have cheap money?

And here we are with Romney, as bad as he is, but still much better than Obama, struggling to overtake the Messiah in the polls. Yes, I know most of those polls are oversampling Democrats by seven to ten percent.

Right now, thanks to cheap money and low interest rates, payments on the debt of the United States for FY2011 were $454.4 billion [1]. The gross federal debt at the time was $14.8 trillion. That’s a rate of just 3%.

In 2008 we paid $451 billion on $10 trillion in debt for a rate of 4.5% [2].

In 2003 we paid $318 billion on $6.7 trillion in debt for a rate of 4.7%.

In 1994 [3] we paid $296 billion on $4.7 trillion in debt for a rate of 6.3%.

So, we see that in better times, people demand more return on their investment. We, as a nation, have to pay a higher rate to get people to buy our debt in the good times. What’s worse is that as buying our debt becomes riskier, people get uppity and demand more return for greater risk. We are over 100% debt to GDP ratio right now. Want to know how hard it is to get people to keep buying debt with that sort of a relationship? Just ask Greece, Spain, Portugal, and Italy.

Something that I have not heard Mitt Romney utter a single word about is what he is going to do, not if, but when we are required to start paying people more to take on our debt. I know he talks about cutting federal spending. But the fact is that if he cuts $1 trillion from our yearly spending, that only prevents us from adding to the debt we already owe. In order to reduce the debt, deeper cuts are in order. And no plan I have seen out of the Romney/Ryan camp comes even close to cutting $1 trillion for a fiscal year.

Realizing that Mitt is going to continue deficit spending for the foreseeable future, our debt load is going to increase. When the economy heats up, investors will demand more and the interest rate on our debt jumps. Where’s that extra money going to come from?

Paying interest on trillions of dollars is a lot of money. I know Mitt knows it. I know Obama doesn’t have a clue about such things. So what’s the plan? Where do we get the dollars? Obama’s philosophy is to abuse our children, print more money, and tell them to work harder for less.

Any plans Mitt? Want to share them with us?

Look, I know it is scary to talk about this stuff. But it needs to be talked about. When America starts to recover, we are going to have to deal with real world economics once again.

And Mitt, if you want to be taken seriously as the adult in the room, God knows Obama can’t be, then you need to spell it out. Tell us how you are going to deal with the interest on our debt ballooning once you and a Republican Congress start peel back the layers of liberalism that are strangling America, but not cutting to the point where we are no longer spending like drunken sailors. We all know you aren’t willing to go all the way and do what really needs done.

I know the standard line Mitt likes to throw out there. He talks about how we can “grow” our way out of our debt problem. But the kind of debt we are dealing with requires more than “growth”. It requires sacred cows to be carved up and sacrificed for the good of this Republic. Because not only is continuing to spend more than we have a problem, figuring out how to pay back the interest on that money is going to be one Hell of a feat in itself.",http://canadafreepress.com/article/romney-needs-to-articulate-his-plans-for-dealing-with-interest-on-our-debt,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

Yes, you are a Nomad in the Earth world. You are an Explorer, a Scout, a Discoverer, a Traveler, a Seeker of All that can be Sought. You are everyone in Existence. You are more than a fragment of yourself. You are not stranded. You are not set apart. You are Oneness tossing your Heart High in the Sky.

You map out your Life. One way or another, your Name is Love. You tend to abscond with Love and save it for a rainy day.

In order to hold on to Love, let it go. This is the way. No one successfully binds Love. There is no thread that can tie Love up tight.

In order to love, toss all your Love away. This is the way Love finds its way back to you. To sustain Love, let go of it. Give all your Love away. Throw all your Love to the Mighty Sun, and then more Love chases after you and sweeps you off your feet.

The spirit of Love requires Freedom. Freedom is Love’s Second Name. Love is a Free Spirit. This is how Love thrives. There is no Love to lay down in a prescribed way. Love has to breathe freely. Love discovers itself. It is said that you fall in Love. May you rise to Love.

Dear Ones, there is no happy ever after when you pin someone else’s Love down. Another’s Love must be Free, or it is not Love. It’s not for you to confiscate another’s Love. Love is free, or it is not Love. Love has to be given to you. Otherwise, you are left with a fistful of straw.

Love asks for nothing. There are no prerequisites or reprisals to Love. Love is free, or Love is not. You don’t exact Love. Love doesn’t have to look a certain way. No one owns another’s Love. Love isn’t to be regimented. Love is not to be lined up.

Love tied up in knots, made to follow a certain structure stifles Hearts. Love is to be the Outpouring of Joy. Another’s Love is not under your jurisdiction. Love is to remain the Joy from the Heart of the One it comes from.

No one has to fill Your Heart to the brim. You cannot make a list to be followed.. Everyone is free to Love you. No one is obliged to Love you or to Love you as you choose. How someone initiates Love to you or returns Love to you isn’t your call. No one is obligated to Love you or restore your Heart. No one is to lay down the Laws of Love to another’s Heart except by choice. No one has the say over your Heart. No one has authority over your Heart. Hearts are not to be legislated. Take your hands off another’s Giving of Love.

There are Laws of Mathematics, and they are to be followed. There are Traffic Laws the same. Stringent Laws for Love have also been laid out in the world. However, the Main Rule of Love that ventures forth from an Open Heart is that Love must be allowed to be free. Love cannot be mandated. Mandating Love closes Love down. Love must be given freely. No one is to engineer another’s Love. Love isn’t to be commanded as to how it is to be issued forth. There is no patent on Love. Love cannot be hand-cuffed. Love holds no prisoners.

No matter how deserving you may be, you are not in charge of another’s Love. Another’s Love is not to be bound to another’s Will. You can’t decide another’s Love. You can’t predetermine another’s expression of Love, and perhaps not even your own. You may not always live up to your own standards.

One of Its Most Respected and Idealistic Faculty Members:

Overzealous Penn State Ethics Panel Overreacts by Wrongly Firing Emmanuil Kaidanov

Penn State became infamous for failing to take prompt action against a staff member of its football program a few years ago. But now it deserves to become even more infamous for allegedly wrongfully firing one of its most respected and idealistic faculty members. It gets even uglier when one discovers that the head coach they fired, Emmanuil Kaidanov, is the most successful head coach in the history of NCAA fencing, and known to be extremely popular, ethical, and loyal to the university and its students for 31 years, bringing fame and glory to the university and lifelong appreciation for the positive influence he has had on his team members.

Kaidanov is a legend for building up a fencing program at Penn State that, in his 31 years at the helm, has amassed a phenomenal, and phenomenally consistent, combined record of 795-77 (91.16% winning record); 403-36 Men’s record (92% winning record) and 392-41 Women’s record (91% winning record), 12 NCAA National Championships; finishes in the top 3 at the conclusion of 25 out of 29 seasons. It has only been getting better! This year, for the first and only time in history, an American is the world champion in foil, and this American is on Kaidanov’s team. The statistics go on and on, but what is almost as amazing is how Coach Kaidanov remains so widely admired and appreciated for having mentored his fencers, raised their spirits, uplifted their values, built their characters, and encouraged their work ethic. So what was the “crime” for which Coach Kaidanov was fired, allegedly without a moment’s warning, without a fair hearing, without a probationary period, and without an opportunity to appeal? He supposedly retaliated against a staff assistant who had made an anonymous phone call accusing somebody on one of his teams of possessing marijuana. The accused student had immediately volunteered to take a drug test, and was cleared of any such accusation; “it wasn’t even close.” So what was the “retaliation”?

The coach had a discussion with his staff assistant in which he told her that he felt she should have reported the allegation to him first. The coach claims he issued no name calling, no threats, and no intimidation of any kind. He claims he did not make any recommendation of any action to be taken against his staff assistant, nor was any retaliation actually taken against her, directly or even indirectly; he only had this one discussion with this assistant on this topic, kept her on in her position, and did not even know at the time of this discussion that the phone call of the report of suspicious activity had been anonymous. The incontrovertible fact is that his staff assistant was never penalized or fired, so this fundamental fact seems to withstand any possible justification for firing the head coach on the grounds of retaliation. Twice, the Coach was summoned to a meeting without having been even told of its agenda or been given an opportunity to hire counsel or to hear from witnesses, let alone to cross examine them or even to look them in the eye. At the second meeting, some questions were posed to him, and allegedly from the same piece of paper, he was told he was fired, in a predetermined manner more reminiscent of Nazi Germany than of the state where the liberty bell once rang, and he was given instructions as to how to end his 31-year career in fewer than 31 minutes. The irony is that if there was any retaliation in this case, it may have been against Coach Kaidanov for exercising his freedom of speech on earlier occasions, allegedly causing him to be fired for some alleged trumped-up charges instead. Many people familiar with this apparent travesty of justice and lack of due process, let alone simple decency and common sense, are appalled at the un-American way the university has allegedly treated one of its most legendary heroes who left the Soviet Union to leave the post-Stalinist world behind him, only to be subjected to such outrageous treatment. It’s a no-brainer that as many people as possible should: urge the university to reinstate Head Coach Kaidanov immediately, demand that he should then be given a fair hearing if such a hearing would be deemed necessary at that point, demand a formal apology, and some compensation for the humiliation that has been imposed on him, urge the university to take appropriate actions against the people responsible for the alleged perversion of justice; urge the university to make sure it can never happen again, contact members of the press and Penn State supporters and alumni to publicize this travesty and to encourage the above suggestions; and sign the petition.

8281,9376,Cannabis Is Making Colorado So Much Money They Literally Have To Give Some Back To Residents,"Source: www.reset.me | Original Post Date: January 30, 2015 –

Colorado is making so much money with cannabis sales that they literally have to give some of it back to residents. So proclaimed a recent AP story by Kristen Wyatt on the booming cannabis industry in the Rocky Mountain state.

The voter-approved law that made cannabis legal in the state was designed to put tax revenues towards schools and other state programs, but an existing state law may send some of the money directly back to residents.

As Wyatt describes it in her piece, the law is causing “quite a headache for lawmakers.”

Colorado’s state constitution sets a limit on how much tax money the state can take in before it has to give some back to the residents. In 1992, Colorado’s voters approved the Taxpayers’ Bill of Rights, a constitutional amendment mandating that all new taxes appear before voters. It states that the state of Colorado must pay back taxpayers “when the state collects more than what’s permitted by a formula based on inflation and population growth. Over the years, Colorado has issued refunds six times, totaling more than $3.3 billion,” Wyatt reports.

“That means Coloradans may each get their own cut of the $50 million in recreational pot taxes collected in the first year of legal weed. It’s a situation so bizarre that it’s gotten Republicans and Democrats, for once, to agree on a tax issue,” Wyatt writes.

Because there is so much tax revenue, and tax collections in Colorado are rapidly increasing, the governor’s budget writers predict roughly $30.5 million will go back to individual residents (about $7.63 per adult in Colorado.)

Both political parties agree there’s “no good reason” to put cannabis dollars back into voter’s pockets, and lawmakers are scrambling to figure out how to avoid it.

That would most likely require asking residents to vote themselves out of the extra cash, by voting to exempt cannabis taxes from the refund requirement.

Lawmakers will have to figure out if the refund money would go to all taxpayers, or just people who purchased cannabis.

In the past, refunds have been paid through income tax returns, as Wyatt notes, “but Colorado also has reduced motor vehicle fees or even reduced sales taxes on trucks… Lawmakers seem confident that the refund mechanism won’t matter because voters would approve pot taxes a third time if asked.”

Israeli company has FDA approval to begin marketing the NeuGuide minimally invasive surgical system

A new mesh-free way to repair pelvic organ prolapse



Amid mounting calls across the world to ban the controversial use of transvaginal mesh to treat pelvic organ prolapse (POP), Israeli company POP Medical Solutions is introducing NeuGuide, an FDA-cleared minimally invasive repair system uniquely requiring neither dissection nor mesh. POP is a common but painful and debilitating condition in which pelvic organs (uterus, vagina, bladder or rectum) sag or drop. Up to half of all women experience POP in their lifetime – especially as they age – making this a $1 billion market. The incidence of POP is expected to rise with increasing life expectancy and obesity.

Traditionally, mesh surgery or even hysterectomy was advised for pelvic organ prolapse. Both are no longer considered ideal, while laparoscopic and robotic surgeries are lengthy and costly. “I’ve spent the last 25 years treating patients with uterine prolapse,” POP Medical founder Dr. Menahem Neuman tells ISRAEL21c. “We don’t want to take out the uterus anymore, because it’s a mistake to take out a healthy uterus. And we don’t want to use meshes because of many complications. So we looked for a safe, simple, durable solution.” He and engineer Boaz Harari cofounded the company to develop their invention, which elevates the uterus back to its normal position within minutes. “I’m quite sure we will change the field completely,” says Neuman, who specializes exclusively in pelvic-floor reconstructive surgery.—More…

ISRAEL21c was founded in 2001, in the wake of the Second Intifada, to broaden public understanding of Israel beyond typical portrayals in the mainstream media.

The organization’s founders – Israeli-American technology executives – understood the great power of the Internet and developed a first-of-its kind online product with global appeal and reach.

8187,9280,‘Clock Boy’ Ahmed Makes it to Mecca with Saudi Funds and Pushes U.S. ‘Islamophobia’ Narrative,"“Clock boy” Ahmed Mohamed made it to Mecca Friday for umrah, the Arabic word for pilgrimage, the portion of his Middle Eastern tour sponsored by the Saudi government. The trip also included the 14-year-old’s parents and other relatives, including one uncle who pushed the Islamophobia narrative.

The uncle, identified by Arab News as Moussa Al-Hassan, asserted: “The ordinary American citizen lives in a state of fear of Arabs because of the American media’s portrayal of him as an extremist terrorist.”

At King Abdul Aziz International Airport in Jeddah on Friday morning, Ahmed thanked the Saudi government for its invitation “to visit the Kingdom to perform Umrah and meet his relatives,” according to Ummid, an Indian news organization. Ahmed recycled a comment made to American news outlets, telling Middle Eastern reporters: “It was really sad that she took the wrong impression of it and I got arrested.” He meant his English teacher who became alarmed when the plugged in unconventional looking homemade clock experiment started to beep in her class.

Ummid editorialized: “Local police insisted that Mohammed’s ethnicity had nothing to do with the decision to arrest him on suspicion of bringing a hoax bomb to school.” Breitbart Texas reported the arrest resulted out of federal and state safe school acts plus district Student Code of Conduct zero tolerance policies, not racism or Islamophobia.

Mohamed is the 14-year-old Sudanese immigrant who brought a homemade suitcase clock into a suburban Dallas high school. The unassigned project, a 120 volt mass of circuitry and wires crafted from a commercially dissembled clock, resembled a “hoax bomb,” prompting the teen’s arrest. Although no charges were filed, MacArthur High School suspended him for three days after which the family withdrew from the Irving Independent School District.

Earlier this month, Ahmed visited Qatar, invited by the Qatar Foundation (QF) for Education, Science and Community Development, founded by Al Jazeera creator Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, who is closely associated with the Muslim Brotherhood and opposes what he calls the “Judaization of Jerusalem” in referencing the Jewish Holy City and Israeli capitol. In late 2012, the New York Times reported Al Thani pledged $400 million to fund Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Last week, Mohamed Elhassan Mohamed, family patriarch, shared 9/11 truther posts on his Facebook wall.

The clockmeister toured Al Thani’s namesake Hamad bin Khalifa University, followed by satellite campuses for Texas A&M University at Qatar (TAMUQ) and Carnegie Mellon, according to a QF press release.

This week, the teen and his family are expected to return stateside, meeting with President Obama and attending the White House astronomy night. Despite all the hype Ahmed put out over social media about bringing the clock-in-a-box to the White House, Irving police spokesman James McLellan confirmed for Breitbart Texas that “to the best of my knowledge,” the family has not yet retrieved the clock.

Since the week of Sept. 14, officers attempted to reach the Mohameds directly and through Anthony Cody, a local activist and family friend, who presented himself to law enforcement as a family representative, according to McLellan. On Sept. 23, Irving PD spoke to news media, debunking the family’s claims that the police will not release the timepiece. McLellan again emphasized to Breitbart Texas that Ahmed’s project is “not being withheld.”

Ahmed also filmed a promotional video to come meet “the clockmaker” at the Islamophobia touting Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) Oct. 17 “Champions for Justice” 21st Anniversary banquet held in Arlington, VA.

2219,2541,Cryptocurrencies dive back down despite a slew of good news – is this proof that whales are moving the market?,"Cryptocurrencies dive back down despite a slew of good news – is this proof that whales are moving the market?

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

The last couple of weeks has been quite the rollercoaster ride in the cryptocurrency world. At times the skeptics enjoyed saying “I told you so” to speculators who saw their fortunes diminish, and days later the tables were turned. Well it’s safe to say today the tables have turned again as just about every single crypto is down with Bitcoin sitting at $10,515 as of me writing this.

Of course, you could be reading this on Tuesday morning and Bitcoin could be at $8,000 or $15,000 – let’s be honest, nobody really knows. Here’s a look at where the top ten cryptos (by marketcap) are right now:

Today’s dip definitely shows that even a slew of good news might not be enough to move the market from red to green. One of the biggest stories of the day comes out of South Korea where the government announced that six major banks will be ready to provide services to cryptocurrency exchanges this month.

“The FSC’s announcement stated that 6 commercial banks including Nonghyup Bank, Industrial Bank of Korea, KB Kookmin Bank, and Shinhan Bank will have the new system in place from January 30, according to the Digital Times.” (Source – news.bitcoin.com)

Given that last week the markets tumbled on fear that South Korea would shut down cryptocurrency exchanges you would think the market would rally. But the reality is that the market may never rally again, or it might rally like it never has before. You can do all the technical analysis you want or quote whatever crypto You Tube star or old school money manager you want but the only right answer about where crypto is going is, who knows?

One of the most popular theories for the current market movement (and in general) is that whales are manipulating the market. Don’t know what whales are? Here’s a good quick description:

“Whales are powerful investors. An individual is considered a whale when he is powerful enough to change the value of a coin in a gigantic amount. When you see an extreme and sudden jump on the chart of your coin, it is for sure that there are one or more whales together influencing the value.” (Source – Steemit.com)

If this is true then your average individual investor/speculator is just along for a ride. While more crypto You Tube sensations are coming out by the day, all of their analysis could just be a bunch of malarky if whales are just deciding when to move the market up or down. Want proof of the impact that a single whale can make? Well there’s speculation that a single trader could have increased the price of Bitcoin by 700% in 2013.

“Based on rigorous analysis with extensive robustness checks, the paper demonstrates that the suspicious trading activity likely caused the unprecedented spike in the USD-BTC exchange rate in late 2013, when the rate jumped from around $150 to more than $1,000 in two months.” (Source – Business Insider)

If one trader can move the market that much, albeit years ago, why would that not be even more possible today, and by more than one trader. The reality is that good news or bad, cryptos might not really be moved by the headlines or FUD like most people would like to believe. The reality could be that whales are out their moving the market to make them millions (or more) while the rest of us hold on for dear life – HODL to the end, right?

What do you think? Comment and let your voice be heard!

Part II: Worshiping at the temple of the Vagina,

Who are they and under whose authority?

When last we spoke, we had established that there has been a great Schism in the Catholic Church. A coup, if you will; one shrouded in open secrecy. Let’s continue…

Today, the Vagina Temple and her ACS (Schismatic American Church) members are applauding an American government which has codified her peoples’ lack of principles and ungodly practices. From t-shirts and flip-flops as commonplace at Mass to the total abdication of our personal responsibilities to the government, the ACS’s focus on the people of God, their finances and more, in all their subjectivity, over the worship and adoration of a loving Father, an Omnipotent God; a God who seeks relationship and family. The crowning achievement of the ASC’s has been two-fold: the abolishment of the core of the First Amendment of the Constitution and the certainty of death for the unborn, the elderly and the infirm. It is pretty obvious by everyone with a pulse that the Holy Catholic Church is suffering from the fruits of “compromise” and a steady decline in leadership over the past 100 years or more. The ‘real’ Church is smaller and shrinking every day. The Popes since Paul VI have called for a “new evangelization” to help stem the rising-tide of the Schismatic American Church. John Paul II pleaded with his Bishops and priests to remain loyal and to focus the faithful on the Eucharist; not as the end of the evangelization road, but rather as its beginning. Instead, we got liturgical dance, clay vessels, a repudiation of the ‘real-presence,’ altar girls, Holy Communion in the hand by an act of disobedience and late-night jockeying by the late Joseph Cardinal Bernadin; we got the removal of the sacred from Church, like the altar rail, statues and more. We got terrible, I mean terrible music, abortion, birth control, sterilization, gay-marriage, openly gay priests, the clergy sex scandal and much, much more. The final worst fruit of the ASC: Putting Jesus in Time-Out. Visit the “average” ASC Church and you won’t find the Tabernacle and the Sanctuary lamp in the center behind or above the altar; no, you likely will have to go to the room adjacent to the broom closet to find Him, and then only if you’re lucky.

Let’s explore the beginnings of their Temple: Secularism in Europe, birth control within marriage; pornographic magazines, the pill, free sex, gay sex, abortion on demand and more…The question remains: Is reuniting the ASC’s with Holy Mother Church possible by way of the destruction of the Temple of the Vagina and a restoration of right-reason? We will have to wait and see… But how again did we get here?

Under who’s authority? Post Crucifixion “popes,” pundits and politicians from the east and the west argued from the beginning about whose Church, whose authority was ultimate, hoping to relegate the other side, all other ‘religions,’ to obscurity. Sadly they have both ignored the genuine authority of God and they both have lost sight of the real enemy, Satan, who is lurking in the background with all his foul lies and temptations. Add to the fire of destroying the Holy Catholic Church the alternate religions, which do not require living under or in or around the “law,” religions that make sacred the carnal and make holy the animal nature of the human person. Today, the Holy Catholic Church, in her metaphysical state, remains perfect; however, here in the mortal coil, she lays in ruins. She has a hierarchy who, by and large, consist of politicians and administrators who, with too precious few exceptions, refuse to accept their Apostolic Charge to fix and rebuild our Church. Nevertheless, before we move to more thoroughly examine the Temple of the Vagina (and by this we mean the great Catholic Schism) here in the United States (and in fairness, the Western World including Europe and Canada), let us first examine what the World really believes to find out why God waited with what he had in the “hold-out” that is the person of Jesus Christ. After all, God could have redeemed the world at another time and even in a different manner. Regardless, at the time of Jesus’ birth, the world was a major mixture of thinking, religions and worship. God’s Plan was to fulfill salvation History that he had begun with Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden and continued with Noah and through Abraham, Moses, David and Jesus. Unfortunately for actual Catholics in the United States and the Western World, history and the fulfillment of God’s plan is lost to silicon chips, the Internet and yes, you guessed it, the Temple of the Vagina.

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

Cryptocurrencies are sliding once again as Asia opens following headlines from South Korea’s finance ministry that a cryptocurrency exchange shutdown is still an option (but admittedly it needs “serious” discussion among ministries first).

While all of the main South Korean ministries agree that there is irrational speculation in cryptocurrency and rational regulation are needed to curb the speculation, only the Justice Ministry has said the shut down of cryptocurrency exchanges is needed as other ministries are concerned about side effects.

As Yonhap reports again, The Office for Government Policy Coordination made the announcement, downplaying the justice minister’s remark last week that the government is working on legislation to close all virtual currency exchanges to tackle speculation.

“The proposed shutdown of exchanges that the justice minister recently mentioned is one of the measures suggested by the justice ministry to curb speculation. A government-wide decision will be made in the future after sufficient consultation and coordination of opinions,” the office said in a statement.

Ripple is leading the overnight slam (down around 10%)…

Which leaves Ripple down 25% year-to-date (while Ethereum remains up around 65%)…

Bitcoin just broke back below $13,000 having tested above $14,000 during the day…

The irony is that all of this ‘news’ hit last night (and has done numerous times) but keeps getting regurgitated as new headlines that take the cryptos down briefly.

HHS Upholding the Law Riles Liberal Media

WASHINGTON, D.C. - Liberal media are upset that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is committed to upholding the rule of law and religious freedom. Politico and the Soros-funded Media Matters targeted Roger Severino, Director of the Office of Civil Rights, and also Shannon Royce, the Director of the Center for Faith-based and Neighborhood Partnership. The articles by Politico and Media Matters were promoted by last week’s announcement that HHS was establishing the Conscience and Religious Freedom Division to review complaints on alleged violations of established federal law that prevents such discrimination. Roger Severino with the Office of Civil Rights, who will serve as the director of the Conscience and Religious Freedom Division, is an accomplished lawyer. He graduated from Harvard Law School with a Juris Doctor degree. He has a master’s degree in Public Policy with high distinction from Carnegie Mellon University and an undergraduate degree in Business from the University of Southern California, where he was a National Merit Scholar. Severino was a trial attorney in the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division. He worked in the Housing and Civil Enforcement Section on dozens of district and appellate court matters, including issues involving the Fair Housing Act and the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act.

Last week, you may have heard rumblings of a last-minute deal. The hope was that we’d all be able to avoid the not-at-all-phony horror of a government shutdown if both sides worked together. We don’t know all the details of this supposed detente, but one thing did leak: Chuck Schumer had offered to fund the border wall in exchange for DACA protections. Now, I know what you’re thinking. There’s simply no way on Earth you could trust Democrats to uphold their end of that bargain. You’re right, the offer was probably phony, or came with so many attached strings that construction would never come to pass. Still, that was the word on the street. Schumer was on board with the evil, racist, wall.

Judicial Watch is seeking the information through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit. Judicial Watch sought “the copy of the budget prepared or submitted” by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. But, on Friday, January 19, the Justice Department notified Judicial Watch that it refuses to turn over documents, stating: “seven pages were located that contain records responsive to your … request. We have determined that this material should be withheld in full because it is protected from disclosure under the FOIA.” The Justice Department asserts the Mueller budget information cannot be released because its release could interfere with “law enforcement proceedings” and the material is protected from disclosure by the “deliberative process privilege.”

So, did the Democrats lose ‘bigly’ with their ridiculous shutdown? Let’s see what the media thinks..

Last week, the media was salivating over the prospect of a federal shutdown. They were, like the Democrats, 100% sure that Republicans (and specifically Donald Trump) would catch the blame just like they did back in 2013. Unfortunately for them, it didn’t work out that way. It became immediately clear that the “shutdown” was a Schumer-orchestrated ruse, designed to tie virtually everything the government does to illegal immigration. It was pig-headed, unnecessary, and ill-conceived. Like most of the stunts Dems have tried over the course of the last year, it was representative of a party desperately overplaying its hand.

Democrats’ politically risky scheme to hold U.S. government operations hostage to their demand that young illegal aliens be granted amnesty failed spectacularly yesterday as lawmakers voted to re-open the briefly shuttered government. Just 69 hours into the shutdown – most of the time passed over the weekend when few Americans even noticed the government was closed – Democrats and other open-borders lawmakers staged a tactical retreat, handing President Trump and anti-amnesty conservatives a clear victory. Democrats no doubt were aware of a Harvard-Harris poll that found 58 percent of voters opposed to the Democrat-led shutdown.

Harvard-Harris poll has absolutely terrible immigration news for Democrats As I’ve said before, Democrats have been overplaying their hand - in spectacular fashion - for years. Their widespread assumption that Hillary Clinton would win the 2016 election in a landslide may be the most obvious example, but it’s certainly not the only instance, nor is it the most recent. That honor goes to the Schumer shutdown. Dems were absolutely, positively, convinced that Trump would catch hell over the government shutdown. They honestly expected a replay of 2013. They didn’t get one. It quickly became clear that the American people were aware that Democrats had initiated the shutdown, they had leveraged children’s healthcare against their agenda, and that agenda was designed to help millions of illegal immigrants.

The Humanitarian Hoax of DACA

The Humanitarian Hoax is a deliberate and deceitful tactic of presenting a destructive policy as altruistic. The humanitarian huckster presents himself as a compassionate advocate when in fact he is the disguised enemy. Obama, the humanitarian huckster-in-chief, weakened the United States for eight years presenting his crippling Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) advocacy as altruistic when in fact it was designed for destruction. His legacy, the Leftist Democrat Party with its ongoing Resistance movement, is the party of the Humanitarian Hoax attempting to destroy the capitalist infrastructure of American democracy through deceitful immigration reforms. This is how it works.

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

Did you know that the number of retail store closings in 2017 has already tripled the number from all of 2016? Last year, a total of 2,056 store locations were closed down, but this year more than 6,700 stores have been shut down so far. That absolutely shatters the all-time record for store closings in a single year, and yet nobody seems that concerned about it. In 2008, an all-time record 6,163 retail stores were shuttered, and we have already surpassed that mark by a very wide margin. We are facing an unprecedented retail apocalypse, and as you will see below, the number of retail store closings is actually supposed to be much higher next year.

Whenever the mainstream media reports on the retail apocalypse, they always try to put a positive spin on the story by blaming the growth of Amazon and other online retailers. And without a doubt that has had an impact, but at this point online shopping still accounts for less than 10 percent of total U.S. retail sales.

Look, Amazon didn’t just show up to the party. They have been around for many, many years and while it is true that they are growing, they still only account for a very small sliver of the overall retail pie.

So those that would like to explain away this retail apocalypse need to come up with a better explanation.

As I noted in the headline, there are 20 different major retail chains that have closed at least 50 stores so far this year. The following numbers originally come from Fox Business…

1. Abercrombie & Fitch: 60 stores

2. Aerosoles: 88 stores

3. American Apparel: 110 stores

4. BCBG: 118 stores

5. Bebe: 168 stores

6. The Children’s Place: hundreds of stores to be closed by 2020

7. CVS: 70 stores

8. Guess: 60 stores

9. Gymboree: 350 stores

10. HHgregg: 220 stores

11. J.Crew: 50 stores

12. JC Penney: 138 stores

13. The Limited: 250 stores

14. Macy’s: 68 stores

15. Michael Kors: 125 stores

16. Payless: 800 stores

17. RadioShack: more than 1,000 stores

18. Rue21: up to 400 stores

19. Sears/Kmart: more than 300 stores

20. Wet Seal: 171 stores

If the U.S. economy was really doing well, then why are all of these major retailers closing down locations?

Of course the truth is that the economy is not doing well. The U.S. economy has not grown by at least 3 percent in a single year since the middle of the Bush administration, and it isn’t going to happen this year either. Overall, the U.S. economy has grown by an average of just 1.33 percent over the last 10 years, and meanwhile U.S. stock prices are up about 250 percent since the end of the last recession. The stock market has become completely and utterly disconnected from economic reality, and yet many Americans still believe that it is an accurate barometer for the health of the economy.

I used to do a Black Friday article every year, but I have ended that tradition. Yes, there were still a few scuffles this year, but at this point the much bigger story is how poorly the retailers are doing.

So far this year, more than 300 retailers have filed for bankruptcy, and we are currently on pace to lose over 147 million square feet of retail space by the end of 2017.

Those are absolutely catastrophic numbers.

And some analysts are already predicting that as many as 9,000 stores could be shut down in the United States in 2018.

Are we just going to keep blaming Amazon every time another retail chain goes belly up?

What we should really be focusing on is the fact that the “retail bubble” is starting to burst. In the aftermath of the last financial crisis, retailers went on an unprecedented debt binge, and now a lot of that debt is starting to go bad.

In fact, in a previous article I discussed the fact that “the amount of high-yield retail debt that will mature next year is approximately 19 times larger than the amount that matured this year”. This is going to have very serious implications on Wall Street, but very few people are really talking about this.

Most stores try to stay open through Christmas, but once the holiday season is over we will see another huge wave of store closings.

And as individual stores close down, this will put a lot of financial pressure on malls and shopping centers. Not too long ago, one report projected that up to 25 percent of all shopping malls in the entire nation could close down by 2022, but I tend to think that number is too optimistic.

The retail industry in the United States is dying, and the biggest reason for that is not Amazon.

Rather, the real reason why the retail industry is in so much trouble is because of the steady decline of the middle class. The gap between the ultra-wealthy and the rest of us is greater than ever, and we can clearly see the impact of this in the retail world.

Retailers that serve the very wealthy are generally doing well, and those that serve the other end of the food chain (such as dollar stores and Wal-Mart) are also doing okay.

But virtually all of the retailers that depend on middle class shoppers are really struggling, and this is going to continue for the foreseeable future.

Most American families are either living paycheck to paycheck or are close to that level, and these days U.S. consumers simply do not have much discretionary income to play around with. More hard working Americans are going to fall out of the middle class with each passing month, and that is extremely bad news for a retail industry that is literally falling apart right in front of our eyes.

Things are heating up this week as world dictators and financial leaders gather in secret meetings all across America to discuss the fate of our global economy. From Federal Reserve leaders, to Obama, to Joe Biden, to Janet Yellen, to many others. Here’s just a piece of the financial events that are taking place this week alone:

1- The Federal Reserve Board of Governors held a “special meeting” Monday April 11th, a closed door session.

2- After the Fed’s meeting on Monday, April 11th Obama and Biden met with Federal Chair Janet Yellen.

3- The Feds posted yet another announcement for two additionally closed door meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday to discuss “bank supervision, financial Markets, Institutions, and Infrastructure).

4- On April 12-April 15th, Washington DC is holding a G-20 meeting about financial workings.

In other words just about every major banker in the world is meeting in Washington, D.C. this week, following three rushed meetings by the Federal Reserve, and a meeting between three power heads Obama, Biden and Janet Yellen. These historic events are causing a tidal-wave of concern to top economic analysis and rightly so! Here’s more on this breaking report…

7945,9016,Long past time to make English the official national language of the United States,"Subscribe to Canada Free Press for FREE

Illegal immigration issue is a timely reminder

Long past time to make English the official national language of the United States

“Language is a unifying instrument which binds people together. When people speak one language they become as one, they become a society”—S.I. Hayakawa Donald Trump’s stance on illegal immigration is a timely reminder that assimilation (to a common language, culture and values) is what makes the United States exceptional. If we are to continue to be the greatest nation on earth then we must remain a melting pot. As Senator Hayakawa so eloquently explained, “The United States, a land of immigrants from every corner of the world, has been strengthened and unified because its newcomers have historically chosen ultimately to forgo their native language for the English language. We have all benefited from the sharing of ideas, of cultures and beliefs, made possible by a common language. We have all enriched each other.”

Two of the iconic phrases that best describe the American experience are “nation of immigrants” and “land of opportunity.” For over 300 years people from around the world have flocked to these shores. They came in search of the American Dream: liberty and prosperity. In his classic study, People of Plenty: Economic abundance and the American character, Professor David M. Potter makes a compelling case for the proposition that the United States is a nation whose national character has been shaped by the perception that there is limitless economic abundance. The Modern Language Association estimates that 149 non-indigenous languages are spoken in the United States. No other nation has so diverse a population of non-native speakers. Traditionally, first generation immigrants spoke little or no English when they set foot in the US. They struggled to learn enough English to function in American society. They embraced American culture and values, and they taught them to their children. Their children were bilingual, speaking their parents’ language at home and English at school and work. The third generation was predominately monolingual, speaking only English. For example, among third generation Asian-Americans, 92% speak only English. The historical importance of English in the development of America’s unique national character is well recognized. Even Mikhail Gorbachev wondered “what would have happened if members of each nation moving to the U.S. had spoken only their own tongues and refused to learn English.” The greatness of the Unites States in large measure derives from our ability to assimilate new immigrants. As Bill Clinton noted, “Our new immigrants must be part of our one America…That means learning English and learning about our democratic system of government.”

Preserve America’s unique cultural identity The National Council of La Raza opposes making English the official national language of the United States on the grounds that “making English our national language hampers the government’s ability to reach out, communicate, and warn people in the event of a natural or man-made disaster.” The Mexican Legal Defense and Educational Fund also vigorously opposes all attempts to make English the official national language of the United States because “making English the sole national language goes against global trends. Making English a national language would be acceptable only if it was “done in tandem with making other languages…the national language and acknowledging that the country is composed of people speaking several primary languages.” Both the National Council of La Raza and the Mexican Legal Defense and Educational Fund would welcome a bilingual America with English and Spanish as our official national languages. But wouldn’t we then also need to make all of the other languages spoken in the US official national languages, and by so doing turn the nation from a melting pot into a polyglot? Ronald Reagan understood the danger that such a path would take us down when he wrote that “by emphasizing the importance of a common language, we safeguard a proud legacy and help to ensure that America’s future will be as great as her past.” Professor Richard Alba, in a study published by the Migration Policy Institute, acknowledges that “bilingualism persists to a greater extent among third-generation Hispanic groups, lending some truth to the claims…that an older pattern of language assimilation…has broken down.” While legal immigration from Latin America does not pose a threat to American culture, illegal immigration from Mexico and Central America does. The continuing influx of illegal Hispanic aliens is a swelling tide, and if this invasion is not halted, it will change America’s national character, and not for the better. Making English our official national language will not directly address the issue of illegal immigration, but it is a necessary step if we are to preserve America’s unique cultural identity.

3133,3606,"7 Signs You Will Be With Someone Forever, According to Real Women","Relationships are different for everyone. What it takes for one to make things work might not be what it takes for another, no two relationships are the exact same.

We all desire different things in life and in love. Just because I value the things I do does not mean that everyone else does. With that being said, if you pay attention to the things below you will see a trend in what people believe it takes to make a ‘forever’ kind of relationship work. However, when you have found the one you just know it.

I came across this Reddit thread not too long ago and I could not help myself, I had to read all of the replies. The list below is compiled of my favorite responses to the question, “Was there a single moment when you just knew that you wanted to be with your SO (significant other) forever? What was it?” The stories these women spoke of were more than enough to bring the power of love rushing through my heart, love is very real for so many people.

7 Things Real Women Think Are Signs As To Whether or Not You Will Be With Someone Forever:

1. “Yep, the eclipse this summer. My SO and I had been together a little over two years at that point. We went to Charleston, SC to be in the path of totality, where we got to watch the eclipse on the sea during a lightning storm (which conveniently didn’t cover the eclipse but did send spectacular pink lightning across the sky during totality). I got hit with this enormous wave of emotion, the gist of which was that I wanted to share all of the amazing experiences I’ll ever have with him, for the rest of my life.” –ChuushaHime

2. “We were friends for quite a while before we started dating, so our relationship progressed quickly once it started heading in that direction. Before we were official, he took me to a “dead” shopping mall by his house at night. There was an arcade inside that was still in business, and as we were walking through the dark, quiet, abandoned mall, I realized that I wasn’t creeped out at all because he was there. I felt 100% safe with him holding my hand. I had never felt that before with anyone else. When we got to the arcade, we saw one of his friends and he introduced me as his girlfriend for the first time, and that was it. I knew I trusted him and wanted him to be with me forever.” –Ashmoe32

3. “A year and a half ago I was traveling in Europe with friends. My SO was at home in the states taking care of life and such. I was at a castle, the view was amazing, and I thought to myself “I wish my husband was here with me to experience it.”

I never thought I would use that term and knew right then that I wanted to marry him. We are getting married in June.” – HiddenTurtles

4. “We had a fight, talked about how we were feeling, and found a solution together.

As someone who grew up with parents who fight and insult each other constantly, being able to finally have a fight with him and resolve it without either of us yelling sealed the deal.” –FeintingFancy

5. “We watched a scary movie with some friends and my nephews, the nephews were about ages 10 & 15. The 10-year old nephew became more frightened of the movie than we expected (there was a long discussion with them both about whether they thought 10 could handle that kind of content and we agreed to watch only so many minutes).

It was Hellraiser, and when he saw the puzzle box changing shape and twisting he started squirming and looking anxious. SO said, ‘ahh, that little box?! That’s the big scary thing in this movie? You could close that thing up forever with duct tape. Lame. Lamest scary movie ever.’ The boys and our friends were cracking up and started coming up with other ways to close up the box with silly household items. 10 was laughing and not anxious anymore, it was great.

I gave my SO a look saying thank you. He gave a look back saying no problem.

It was the first time he felt like family.

That was at three months of dating and seven months of friendship. We’ve been together almost ten years now, married almost four.” –HowTown103

6. “I was working from home one day at his apartment about 5 months in to our relationship. He only had a half day so he drove in and left me to do some work on my laptop in his bed. While he was gone and I was on a conference call I leaned into his body pillow and got a whiff of his smell. When I smelled him I got this giddy euphoric feeling and hugged that pillow till he came home. That day I told him I loved him.” –Ttamevoli

7. “Honestly I think it all the time. First time was when he said “I love you”, it was so genuine.. he meant it. He always has my back no matter what and even though we are both stubborn, we click. He’s made me a better person and I’ve never wanted to put so much effort into something. He does little things like run upstairs to help with groceries when I get home, to surprising me with flowers or a bottle of wine after a bad day, he makes me coffee every morning and supper during the week because I work later. He never complains. He always thanks me when I do the smallest thing.

He puts in so much effort. Sometimes we have all nighters and just talk and drink and open up completely. We can have fun at parties but we can also have a two person party and have just as much fun.

We are both similar and appreciate the other person. It’s honestly the best relationship I’ve ever had and I know I want to be with him forever.” –PilonA3

So you see, forever is just forever and love is just that, love. You cannot force it and it happens gradually for some and overnight for others. Real love is not something you can force, you either have it or you don’t.",http://awarenessact.com/7-signs-you-will-be-with-someone-forever-according-to-real-women/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
8154,9244,TURKEY-RUSSIA TURMOIL,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned Turkey there will be “significant consequences” for what he characterized as a “stab in the back” committed by “accomplices of terrorists.” The Turkish military insists that two jets approached their border and were warned “10 times” before one of the planes was shot down. Putin disagreed . “The Russian bomber was shot down over Syria by an air-to-air surface fired from a Turkish F-16 plane when the bomber was at an altitude of 6,000 meters at a distance of 1 km from the Turkish bomber,” he stated.

Leading from behind, or more accurately, failing to lead at all, has its consequences. Turkish jets shot down a Russian Su-24 fighter jet Turkey claimed was over its airspace, and both pilots were reportedly killed. In addition, American-backed Syrian rebels shot down a Russian rescue helicopter, killing one crew member. Russian guided missile cruiser Moskva will now be deployed off the Syrian coast, with Lieutenant General Sergey Rudskoi warning that “every target posing a potential threat will be destroyed,” and all military contacts with Turkey “will be suspended.” As PJ Media’s Richard Fernandez deftly explains , the latest turn of events is “a clear sign of how dangerous Obama’s Syria policy has become. The vacuum left by his policy has not only engendered a chaos which has destroyed whole countries, but it has drawn in great powers whose armed forces are operating in dangerously close proximity.” In short, this is how wars begin.

Erdogen further maintained he bore no “enmity” toward Russia or any other nation, but criticized Moscow for its incursion in the Turkmen regions where there were no ISIS fighters. He also indicated he would continue to support the Turkmen community in Syria. Thus, we have a confrontation between a megalomaniac with dreams of restoring the Ottoman empire versus an ex-KGB thug who dreams of a Soviet Union revival. And because Turkey is a member of NATO, whose members are bound to defend each other, the risk of escalation, while improbable, cannot be ignored.

Putin is hardly blameless. He has spent considerable effort testing American , British and other NATO nations’ airspace in recent years. Unfortunately for the Russians, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was less accommodating than Obama and Cameron. Erdogan insisted level-headedness had prevented even graver incidents at the border, and that the fighter was shot down in line with Turkey’s rules of engagement.

Army Col. Steve Warren, the top military spokesman in Baghdad, backed Turkey’s version of the event, but hedged in the process of doing so. “The incident happened at the border,” Warren said. “These things are not as clean as they are in the movies.” He further explained command was studying radio chatter, radar images and other data before making a definitive conclusion. Later, however, a U.S. official reported to Reuters that the Russian jet did appear to have been shot down over Syrian airspace after briefly entering into Turkey.

Obama declared that the climate change summit in Paris beginning next week would constitute a “powerful rebuke” to terrorists

President Obama, no doubt sensing an opportunity to tweak his foremost adversary, insisted the incident might not have occurred if the Russians were more interested in targeting ISIS than the so-called Syrian moderates who opposed President Bashar Assad. “I do think that this points to an ongoing problem with the Russian operations,” Obama said. “In the sense that they are operating very close to a Turkish border, and they are going after moderate opposition that are supported by not only Turkey but a wide range of countries.” He further insisted “some of those conflicts, or potentials for mistakes or escalation, are less likely to occur” if Russia focuses on ISIS, and that Turkey “has a right to defend its territory and its airspace.”

Obama made his remarks while standing next to French President Francois Hollande, who was in Washington. Ironically Hollande was there in part to urge Obama to work with Russia towards building a coalition to fight ISIS. Apparently the French President is insufficiently impressed by what Obama referred to as a “robust” coalition of 65 countries fighting against ISIS, up from 62 in 2014.

Yet as Foreign Policy Magazine revealed last year “robust’ is a slippery term. “Although many countries have pledged military or humanitarian support, the State Department indicates that simply ‘exposing ISIL’s true nature’ can qualify a nation for the coalition,” it stated.

Nonetheless both presidents agreed to carry on with Obama, stating the U.S. and France “stand united,” and that ISIS “cannot be tolerated” and “must be destroyed.” In the meantime, Hollande intends to admit 30,000 Syrian “refugees” into France, while Obama remains committed to taking in 10,000, despite the House passing a bill aimed as halting the settling of Syrian and Iraqi refugees, and overhauling a screening process. Forty-seven Democrats joined their GOP colleagues in favor of the measure.

Regardless, Obama remained defiant. “Nobody who sets foot in America goes through more screening than refugees,” he insisted. If that sounds familiar, maybe it’s because Hollande also insisted France will continue to “do the necessary checking before accepting refugees on [its] territory,” five days after the second terror attack against his nation this year. He also doubled-down on the same maddening denial of reality that afflicts Obama. “Some want to establish a link between the influx of refugees coming from the Middle East and the terrorist threat,” he stated.

Apparently the reality that a link was established is irrelevant.

As for Obama, it would appear his administration is dedicated to denying reality. In a bombshell admission made Monday, Rep. Jackie Speier (D-CA), one of the ranking Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee, said it was likely administration officials doctored the intel on ISIS to make it seem as if more progress was being made than had actually occurred. While she believes the intelligence community has provided more accurate assessments recently, “CENTCOM, which is the area that is responsible for the Middle East… has dumbed down the intelligence, has sweetened it, has made it seem like we are being more successful there than we are ... “

Add the power vacuum engendered in the Middle East by our see-no-Islamic-evil president, and the lack of anything resembling a coherent strategy is a recipe for disaster. Putin is a small enough man that he will likely exact revenge from the Turks, and Erdogan might just well be willing to return the favor. All while Obama dithers and promises us—yet again—that he will degrade and destroy ISIS with a strategy that includes dropping leaflets on Syrian drivers before bombing ISIS oil tanker trucks “to kind of shoo people away without harming them,” according to Operation Inherent Resolve spokesman Col. Steve Warren. “We have not struck these trucks before,” Warren revealed. “We assessed that these trucks, while although they are being used for operations that support ISIL, the truck drivers, themselves, [are] probably not members of ISIL; they’re probably just civilians. So we had to figure out a way around that. We’re not in this business to kill civilians, we’re in this business to stop ISIL—to defeat ISIL.”

Perhaps someone should have asked Warren how many civilians will be exterminated by ISIS while they remain viable entity—because the Obama administration cannot abide an iota of collateral damage.

“History teaches that wars frequently start by accident,” Fernandez warns. “Otto von Bismarck who understood that accidental discharge can kill a man just as surely as an aimed shot, observed more than a century ago that ‘Europe today is a powder keg and the leaders are like men smoking in an arsenal ...’”

Obama is just such a “leader,” a man who actually declared that the climate change summit in Paris beginning next week would constitute a “powerful rebuke” to terrorists, “when the world stands as one and shows that we will not be deterred from building a better future for our children.” The American public must understand there is no cure for ideologically-inspired insanity. It must be voted out of office—or there may be no future for our children at all.",http://canadafreepress.com/article/turkey-russia-turmoil,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

The Iranian Regime is facing its most turbulent period since its takeover in 1979, but whilst the world is focused on the nuclear deal and the Regime’s proxy terrorist forces across the Middle East; it is the domestic situation that will plague the Regime most.

The Iranian people are the chief victims of the Regime. They are murdered, imprisoned, beaten, and robbed by the ruling mullahs with no let-up and little international focus. That’s why the Iranian people are taking to the streets in protest.

The National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) wrote: “Unemployment and poverty levels are rising in Iran, inflation has reached record levels and the very low minimum wage means many citizens must take on several jobs just to survive. The number of people living under the poverty line is on the rise. People have been compelled to sell their kidneys and retinas; there is a growing number of drug addicts, some as young as 15; people live in open graves; child labour and homelessness are rampant. Yet, the mullahs live a life of luxury and spend billions of euros on the war in Syria and on funding Hezbollah and other terrorist groups.”

Street Protests

The NCRI estimates that in recent months there have been 20-25 anti-regime protests across Iran each day. Many start with the focus of addressing specific problems, like the extrajudicial killings of young porters by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) or the stealing of their savings by the IRGC’s Caspian Financial Institution, but soon turn political with anti-regime chants.

Ahvaz, October 25: A large group of demonstrators, chanting “Rouhani, this is the last warning”, “Where is our money? Bahrain, Qatar or Syria?”, and “They have stolen people’s money and they are attacking the people”, clashed with security forces.

Tehran, October 23: 2,000 people protested outside of the Parliament, chanting “Shame on the police force”, “Cannons, machine guns, tanks no longer work”, and “death to the dictator”, and were met with violent security forces and arrests.

Tehran, Mashhad, Rasht, Ardebil, Kerman and Ahvaz, October 15: Thousands marched in the central streets to express their anger at the Regime, chanting “Death to this Oppression”, “Justice, justice” and “Rouhani, shame!”,

1988 Massacre

There is also a growing movement calling for justice for the 30,000 political prisoners (mainly supporters of the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran) massacred in 1988. The Regime has spent three decades attempting to cover up their role in the massacre and evade justice, but the Iranians will not let this be forgotten.

In the run up to the presidential elections, in which the Supreme Leader’s nomination, Ebrahim Raisi, was a member of the Death Commissions that sent the political opposition to their death, many stuck up posters and sprayed messages across Iran calling for criminal charges against the mullahs.

The Iranian Regime is terrified of being overthrown by their people, which is why the international community should support the Resistance in order to send a message to the mullahs that this will not be tolerated.",http://beforeitsnews.com/iran/2017/11/iran-regime-scared-of-overthrow-by-its-people-2439282.html,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
3536,4058,US EPA Scientist Fired For Trying To Tell The Truth About Climate Engineering And Fluoridated Water,"Dane Wigington

GeoengineeringWatch.org

The public has been trained and conditioned to believe that federal agencies like the EPA exist to watch over them and warn them of any potential dangers. This notion could not be further from the truth. Though there are honest and caring people within these agencies (like the scientist who has drafted the statement below), the institutions as a whole exist to hide threats from the population, not to disclose them. The majority of the public continues to convince themselves that if there was really anything they should be concerned about, someone, somewhere, in some federal public protection agency would tell them. The statement below should be a sobering wake-up call for us all. It is yet another confirmation of all that has been stated above. From global geoengineering, to Fukushima, to toxic fluoridated water and lethal vaccinations, the public health and the health of our biosphere is being decimated. Where are the official warnings from official agencies? The truth continues to be hidden by the government agencies that are tasked with hiding it.

Michael Davis is now a former EPA scientist who is working with GeoengineeringWatch.org in an effort to get the truth out, his full resume is at the bottom of this article. Michael was recently terminated from the EPA for daring to tell the truth about two extremely dire public dangers, the highly toxic fallout from climate engineering, and the willful contamination of the public water supply with industrial waste. I had the pleasure and honor of working with Michael for over a year, he has participated in conference calls directly with the Geoengineering Watch legal team (Legal Alliance to Stop Geoengineering, LASG). Upon being terminated from the EPA, I asked Mr. Davis if he would draft a statement for GeoengineeringWatch.org, that statement is below.

A Statement For GeoengineeringWatch.org From Scientist Michael Davis

My name is Michael Davis, I was employed as an Environmental Engineer for nearly 16 years in the National Pollution Discharge Elimination Systems (NPDES) Programs Branch of the Water Division in Region 5, Chicago of the USEPA. I was terminated as a public servant performing a public service for raising the issues of anthropogenic deposition of aluminum due to atmospheric geoengineering.

In addition, I brought up the industrial hazardous waste byproduct of fluoride known as HFSA (being sold primarily by the phosphate fertilizer and aluminum industries) to drinking water utilities for disposal into the nation's drinking water systems. This does not include pollutants that are discharged from wastewater reclamation facilities into receiving waters. The issue regarding anthropogenic deposition of aluminum due to atmospheric geoengineering came up in May 2013 when a colleague in the NPDES Programs Branch sent a general email to everyone regarding ""NPDES and Climate Change"". I sent a six (6) bullet point one – sentence response to my colleague. Nearly six (6) weeks later my supervisor (at the time) set up a conference call to inform me that I would be receiving a Letter of Reprimand for making false, malicious and unfounded statements against colleagues, supervisors, management and elected public servants. Furthermore, my then supervisor claimed that my statements damaged the integrity and reputation of the agency. In April, 2014, my last supervisor assigned me to the Beloit, Wisconsin wastewater reclamation facility DRAFT permit review. I asked the permit writer why fluoride (a poison) was be disposed of in Beloit's drinking water supply? She could not provide an explanation. Approximately two (2) weeks later my supervisor placed a ""gag order"" on me barring me from having any communication written or verbal with anyone unless he approved ahead of time and was present on all conference calls. It was claimed by my supervisor (and management) that the ""gag order"" would remain in place to prevent me from making statements that would further damage the integrity and reputation of the agency. Furthermore, my supervisor kept giving me assignments like Beloit, Wisconsin where fluoride, along with other pollutants knowing that I would describe the adverse human, animal health effects along with adverse environmental effects of them in my DRAFT Permit review reports. The adverse human, animal and environmental effects were completely ignored by my supervisor. This was even more profound when it came to the issue of fluoride as HFSA being deposited into the drinking water system. This is in violation of (1) EPA's Policy on Scientific Integrity, (2) The Precautionary Principle, (3) 5 U.S.C. §2302(b)(8) and (4) Informed Consent. My supervisor informed me that the EPA does not regulate fluoride in the drinking water systems under either the Clean Water Act (CWA) or the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). However, FDA under Health and Human Services (HHS) regulated fluoride in the drinking water systems. I eventually crafted a general description of the adverse human and animal health effects in an email to my supervisor and upper level management. Initially was ignored by all of them. I had to send the original descriptive email several times over about a six (6) month period of time before I received a reply from the water division director who just parroted the corporate agenda pertaining to fluoride disposal into the nation's drinking water systems.

The label in the photo above should be shocking to any that are even slightly awake. Highly toxic industrial waste that is officially labelled as a ""drinking water additive"".

In doing my own research into the issue of anthropogenic deposition of aluminum from atmospheric geoengineering (as well as fluoride and other pollutants) in an attempt to determine why there was strong opposition from my supervisor and the EPA in general it this (factual reports on the issues). It is because the EPA wants to continue their cover-up, collusion, and criminality pertaining to pollution and contamination being perpetrated by their puppet masters, the multinational corporations. The EPA (like the FDA, CDC, etc) is a complete sham. Because the ""P"" in EPA stands for protection of corporate profits and not for protecting human, animal and environmental (or biosphere) health. The EPA like other governmental regulatory agencies are corrupt to the core, completely dysfunctional and have been completely hijacked by the multinational corporations. I will not allow any of my ex – supervisors, ex – branch chiefs, ex – divisions directors, ex – EPA acting regional administrator or ex – EPA administrator or other individuals either identified or unidentified to get away contaminating our one and only biosphere (soil, water and air), and causing untold adverse human and animal health effects.

The threats we collectively face are immense and grave. These existential threats are being hidden from public view by government agencies which are completely controlled by a criminal power structure that operates in the shadows with impunity. Those who serve public protection agencies must find the courage to stand up and speak out as Michael Davis has. Others (in the same agencies), who have committed themselves to being shameless tyrannical order followers, must be exposed and held accountable, legally and morally. The battle before us to fully expose the truth requires our full commitment. Each of us is needed, all can make a difference. All can and must make their voices heard in the fight for the greater good, we are rapidly running out of time. My deepest respect and regard for the courage and concern for the greater good that Michael Davis has shown.

5471,6226,The Ruins of Chaco Canyon in Northwest New Mexico,"According to experts in the field, and others, it appears as though they ate each other, or were sacrificed and devoured between the ninth and 12th centuries by a ruling elite of Mesoamerican cannibals intent on maintaining their grip on power through sheer terror. Or maybe they were gobbled up in the 1100s by invading hordes from Old Mexico, the Toltecs. Regardless of who perpetrated this unseemly culinary tradition, or why, it’s virtually certain that human sacrifice and the feast that followed were not limited to country folk in far-flung communities, but likely practiced in a big way in the big city at Chaco Canyon as well. The debate rages on.

They came. They built. They vanished. Unique among Native American prehistoric civilizations, the gradual rise and terribly swift fall of the Ancient Pueblo Indians of America’s Southwest, the Anasazi, continues to transfix modern man. Understandably, admiration for the ancients’ beautiful architectural triumphs and preconceived notions about this relatively peaceful utopian civilization of farmers have been tarnished by what is considered heresy among many archeologists and self-proclaimed descendants of the Anasazi - the Hopi, Zuni and other pueblo peoples.

Empty and quiet now, a great civilization once thrived a thousand years ago among the silvery sage, sand and rolling high-desert steppes, and flat-topped mesas. Chaco country is Indian country, brown mostly, with some red and tan thrown in along the cliffs. It’s brutally cold in winter, parched and broiling during the height of summer. Overhead, ink-blue New Mexico skies hover clean and bright, and turn brilliant at sunset. A word to the wise - the park is remote, so come prepared and expect to camp if you wish to spend the night, if there’s room.

Among the thousands of ancient Anasazi ruins scattered throughout the Southwest, none captivate more than the incredible, sandstone brick-and-mortar remains of fifteen major building complexes in and around Chaco Canyon in sparsely populated Northwest New Mexico. These large urban structures form the centerpiece of 33,000-acre Chaco Culture National Historical Park which you’ll find off Highway 550 at the end of a long and insanely bumpy dirt road near the eastern fringe of the Navajo Nation.

For roughly 150 years, from A.D. 1000 to 1150, the Four Corners region was dominated by the Chacoan culture emanating from Chaco Canyon. A thriving crossroads engaged in trade, light manufacturing, ceremony and worship, Chaco was the vibrant hub of a rich cultural wheel that radiated outward to communities many miles distant. You could say all roads led to Chaco, literally. No less than six major Chacoan roads extended from the central canyon outward for up to 60 miles in straight lines.

Far from half-hazard foot trails, these roads were surveyed and engineered with uncanny skill and precision which attests to the advanced nature of this sprawling “stone-age” society. Thirty feet wide, traversing cliffs and deep arroyos, these main highways connected with hundreds of miles of Chacoan roadways to form an inter-connecting web that wove together dozens of outlier pueblo communities. Some of these communities built their own Great Houses - over one hundred throughout the San Juan Basin - rivaling in size many of those found at Chaco Canyon.

While trade goods no doubt were transported along the primary thoroughfares - macaws from southern Mexico (they were partial to the feathers), sea shells from the ocean, copper bells, ceramics and turquoise - today’s Navajo and notable archaeologists believe the major arteries were used primarily for transporting timber to Chaco Canyon from forested mountains like the Chuskas fifty miles to the west. It’s estimated 200,000 trees were used in constructing Chaco’s structures. Considering the Anasazi had no draft animals and walked everywhere, in crude sandals no less, their accomplishments were all that more admirable. On the other hand, some archeologists believe the roads, initially, played religious and ceremonial roles due in part to their alignment, and the fact that some don’t seem to go anywhere in particular.

A one-way paved road will loop you down Chaco Canyon seven miles and return you back to the visitors center. This route provides access to several trailheads and numerous complexes; Una Vida, Chetro Ketl, Pueblo Alto on top of the mesa, Kin Kletso, Pueblo del Arroyo and Casa Rinconada, and others. But the flagship of this vast urban center, which by 1050 had become the economic, administrative and ceremonial headquarters of the San Juan Basin, was Pueblo Bonito at the far end of the canyon. It was occupied from the mid-800s to the 1200s and became the beating heart of this remarkable culture.

Likened to the Roman Coliseum, but not quite as big, the neatly stacked remains of Pueblo Bonito is the largest and grandest “Great House” in Chaco Canyon, and recently struck me with awe much as it did in 1979 when I first laid eyes on those sun-lit blocks of stone at the crack of dawn one fine spring morning. Built with 30,000 tons of sandstone blocks, and shaped in the letter ‘D’ near the base of 200-foot-high sandstone cliffs, Pueblo Bonito, like most of the area’s dominant structures, wasn’t built in fits and starts as the need arose, but was planned in advance, designed and constructed one large section at a time. This massive complex rose to a height of four or five stories along the curving, outer back wall, and was comprised of over 600 rooms stacked and progressively tiered. Exterior masonry walls were up to three feet thick, and a large open plaza dominated the complex’s interior.

Throughout Pueblo Bonito one finds the circular remains of forty kivas, sunken rooms originally flat-topped and accessible by ladder through a hole in the roof. Kivas have achieved iconic status in the Southwest - they’re round - and were central to the ancients’ religious life. They also served as ceremonial, social and political gathering places. Some kivas in Chaco Canyon were very large, accommodated great crowds and were free-standing. They may have towered two to three stories high, though most were smaller and clustered together. From a photographer’s perspective, the resulting patterns laid down by the ruins are intriguing, particularly at Pueblo Bonito and Chetro Ketl where the kivas’ gentle curves are juxtaposed beside the ordered symmetry of rectangular boxed rooms and stone walls teetering on collapse.

Reflecting the surrounding high desert, cliffs, and boulders that line the canyon, Chaco’s ruins appear mundane and subdued by earthy browns and the deep reds. But one must not think of ancient Chaco as bland. Blue, yellow, red, green and white pigment stains were extracted from a variety of minerals and used to brighten up this thriving urban center that bustled with hundreds, even thousands, of men, women and children. And what they left behind has provided modern man a veritable window into their complex past.

Over 4,000 sites in the park have been identified so far, most of which are prehistoric, and many of those have been excavated, tested and legally pilfered for posterity and preservation. Many, if not most, of the artifacts were gathered between 1970 and 1985 and cover each cultural time period, such as the Archaic, Basketmaker and Pueblo eras. We also know about their natural environment through the collection and study of tree-ring-dating wood samples, soil and mineral samples, pollen and botanical specimens, and rat middens, or dung-heaps, all of which bring today’s quiet, crumbling ruins to life and enriches our understanding of these short but stocky, sun-burned people.

This vast treasure trove of artifacts and relics unearthed at Chaco beginning in the early 20th century attests to the rich diversity of Chacoan culture. Over one million ancient archeological objects, a staggering number, have been collected over the years; hoes and hammers, mauls and digging sticks, turkey bones and corn cobs, shards and lithics, yucca sandals and reed matting, bone tools, stone tools, ceramic vessels - much pottery elaborately detailed in geometric black-and-white patterns - turquoise and shell ornaments, and arrow heads. The Anasazi were particularly fond of carved pendants, and obsessed with beadwork. Two burial plots at Pueblo Bonito alone contained over 15,000 beads and pendants.

Try, and with a little imagination you can envision crumbled walls magically reassembled to their original height, covered in plaster and decorated with murals now long gone. Roofless kivas and square-cornered rooms exposing dirt floors to direct sunlight are covered with flat tops banishing sun and sky, turning things dark and cozy inside, if not a bit ripe.

Meandering from room to room at Pueblo Bonito, your trusty self-guided tour book in hand, you’ll realize how architecturally sophisticated these people were as you bend over and squeeze through small doorways, pausing to watch Jane Anasazi standing over a blackened pot, panting in the heat, stirring the family’s remaining handful of beans, maybe some squash, a hint of wild turkey parts mechanically separated, and the last of the brown water. The amber glow cast by the fire’s flame bends the starving woman’s shadow across the wall, while her naked infants, Mabel and Alfred, squat underfoot playing with the floor. It’s smoky, and on its perch high in the corner a beautiful scarlet macaw squawks once, then twice, sensing that it’s next on the menu unless things improve around here, and soon.

Facing the corner on his knees with head bowed is Jane’s husband, Joe, near defeat and pleading with a small clay idol statue he believes to be a god, his personal god named Zani-Moki (“Give-Me-Stuff”), the head deity of a new religion he read about on the back cover of Popular Mechanics. He thought he’d give Zani-Moki a try. After all, nothing else was working. He begs for mercy and relief, a miracle, something, anything, that will deliver his family from the grueling drought that was baking the Southwest and charbroiling the entire San Juan Basin. His thoughts tumble around the inside of his simple mind, searching for a way out, a way to express themselves concretely. He wants desperately to put words to parchment, make a to-do list, send his pigeon for help, maybe start a diary, put order to the disorder. He sighs on behalf of all Anasazi, thinking, “If only we had a written language.”

A perfect storm of want and desperation engulfed Chaco in the 1100s. Due to over-consumption, gone were the juniper and pine forests that covered the land and the canyon bottom. Edible plant life and habitat shriveled up. Shallow water courses previously dammed became dust bowls; granaries full of corn, squash and beans were becoming depleted. The Anasazi of the 12th century became perilously iron deficient from a lack of protein. They craved meat, but the last of the rats, beaver, rabbits and prairie dogs hopped off or scurried away long ago, or had been trapped and devoured in a desperate last-ditch panic.

These little people in cracked, leathery skin were dying of thirst and hunger, and the Joe Anasazi family was no exception. He was in denial and one of the remaining holdouts at half-empty Pueblo Bonito. He couldn’t bring himself to pack up his family and leave with the others, migrate north or south or east or west like his brethren who finally caved in to the desperation and staggered off into the luminescent orange sunset.

The stubborn, proud man in soiled loincloth sat chewing his filthy fingernails and continued praying, confident that his clay idol would deliver them from all this evil. But Jane knew better. She stood by the last fire they would ever make and stirred their last pot of grub, fretting and twisting the long strands of her black hair, fearing the worst, imagining the unimaginable. What if the rumors filtering up from the south were true? What if the horror stories that sent others fleeing in sheer panic were true?

A shudder set her shoulders a-twitching and her knees a-knocking. Setting aside her ladle, she shuffled over to her husband one more time and knelt beside him, cupped his chin in her dirty hand, and turned his head into the wavering light. Though she loved Joe, she wasn’t in love with him and secretly thought of ways to dump the old boy. Truth be told, she had a thing for Frank, the sandal-maker, who took off for Sand Island last week and was waiting for her and the kids. She wanted so much to run away with her secret lover, and the others, to someplace exotic; start over, take up needlepoint, learn to rumba, maybe splurge on a facial. She chose her words carefully and tried to reason with her boring husband.

Joe shook his head in defiance and turned back to the idol. Feeling the onslaught of another panic attack, his wife grabbed him by the shoulders and shook him violently. “Snap out of it, you moron. It’s just a piece of clay!” And that’s when they heard the knock at the door.

Depending on your sources, by the 1200s the Anasazi of Chaco Canyon had vanished into thin air, and by the 1300s that entire civilization throughout the Southwest disappeared. It is one of the great archeological and anthropological mysteries yet to be solved, though many theories have been advanced. A crippling 50-year drought appears to be the seminal culprit; a lack of water lead to inevitable crop failure and famine.

Overpopulation meant the over-consumption of wildlife and other meat sources. Forest products - trees - were depleted which contributed to erosion, cold meals and frigid winter nights. Plague could have thinned the masses in one fell swoop. Some theorize a religious mass exodus lead them away, or maybe they just got tired of the place and walked off to greener pastures and wetter streams. And who can blame them? This place is dry and dusty, and that’s in a good year.

These factors, and others, could have congealed into a cauldron of catastrophes that collectively brought down the Anasazi. Take your pick, though any one of these scenarios would make for a boring motion picture; gradual starvation and sickness are not engaging plot lines. If I were writing the script I’d go with option ‘D’ and throw in the man-eaters, invading Toltec cannibals from southern Mexico who, on arriving in drought-stricken Northwest New Mexico found nothing for lunch except a few starving Anasazi dirt farmers staggering around in a hungry daze too weak to flee or fight.

For the most part, the idea of cannibalism, particularly at the wholesale level, has been anathema to mainstream archeologists and others in the field, and any such suggestion has been deemed racist, insensitive and politically incorrect. The Hopi and other contemporary descendants of the Anasazi are particularly incensed at the very thought of their noble ancestors partaking of human flesh, even though it appears from strong evidence uncovered during the past forty years that cannibalism was a sad fact of Anasazi life.

The chief proponent of this unsettling theory is Professor Christy Turner, and his wife Jacqueline, who devoted considerable time and energy examining the evidence. Publishing a 500-page tome of their findings and analysis in 1999 entitled, “Man Corn: Cannibalism and Violence in the Prehistoric American Southwest,” the authors examined 72 Anasazi sites, most of which showed signs of cannibalism or brute violence and mutilation. Of those sites, 38 were most likely “charnel deposits,” heaps of cannibalized remains of men, women, and even children. Some sites contained the remains of as many as 35 people, which converts roughly to one ton of meat, enough to feed a large war party. It’s quite possible, then, if not probable, that no less than 300 people were chopped up, barbequed, boiled or fried, and eaten in this study alone. The title of the Turners’ book, “Man Corn,” is fitting, a literal translation of the Aztec word “tlacatlaolli,” which refers to (hold on to your stomach) “a sacred meal of sacrificed human meat, cooked with corn, a side of fries and chocolate ice cream for desert (drinks not included)”; a disgusting high-protein, but certainly well-balanced, diet.

According to Mr. Turner, for humans back then to be considered cannibalized their remains must pass a series of tests. Bones had to be broken open for the marrow and covered in saw and cutting marks as though they were butchered and dismembered. Some of the bones must show “anvil abrasions,” particularly on skulls which indicated attempts to crush them between two rocks. Burned bone fragments were required, particularly skulls, because severed heads were often placed face-up in a fire’s coals to cook the brain. Yes, the brain. Furthermore, most of the spongy bone and vertebrae had to be missing, crushed for bone cakes or boiled for the grease.

Turner’s criteria for establishing cannibalism (anthropophagy) also included “pot polish,” a theory substantiated by noted paleoanthropologist Tim D. White. Pot polish is found on the ends of bones cooked in a ceramic pot for the fat which floats to the top and is skimmed off. As the bones are stirred, the ends in contact with the inside of the pot become polished with microscopic abrasions.

Ancient human excrement, or coprolite, discovered near a charnel heap, provided the missing link that proved humans ate humans. After rigorous testing it was determined that the coprolite contained the human protein myoglobin, which is only found in heart muscle and skeletal muscle, and which can only enter the intestines if eaten. Myoglobin was also discovered on the inside of a cooking pot. It should be the final nail in the skeptics’ coffin.

Despite this proof, many critics were outraged and attempted to explain away these findings. Some went so far as to claim there never were such things as cannibals, anywhere, ever. Others argue these were isolated incidents. Perhaps those eaten were deserving witches, or sworn enemies who had it coming, or the evidence indicated common mortuary practices. Regardless of speculation, all Anasazi risk being painted with broad strokes of over-generalization; some might draw the conclusion that all Anasazi were cannibals, extremely brutal, and fed on a steady diet of man-flesh; that it was a way of life that vanished by the 1300s when their civilization dissolved. But that’s not fair.

It’s understandable why today’s descendants of the Anasazi, the Hopi, Zuni and other pueblo peoples, are dismayed by the very thought of mild-mannered farmers committing such heinous sins. Realistically, though, it’s within the realm of human possibility. Humans commit the unthinkable, and no civilization is exempt. Dachau, Pol Pot’s Cambodia, Rwanda ... the list over the ages is endless. Even God’s chosen people, the ancient Hebrews, sacrificed their children in the fire to the false god Moloch. And when the Babylonian Empire laid siege to Jerusalem in 586/87 B.C., the city’s inhabitants boiled and ate their own children in desperation. People do things.

Questions remain: Did the Anasazi routinely cannibalize each other, neighbor on neighbor? Were they simply starving to death and consequently turned on each other? The sheer brutality of the sacrifices, the clubbing and smashing, suggests not. Turner proposed another alternative. He thinks it’s possible a band of Toltecs from Mexico (800 – 1100) became the ruling elite over the Anasazi by sheer force and terror, employing cannibalism and human sacrifice to maintain their tyrannical grip on power for years. And when the Anasazi got tired of it, they revolted and/or ran off.

The idea is not all that far-fetched given the fact that human sacrifice and cannibalism were practiced throughout the jungles of Central Mexico, and the deserts of northern Mexico, and the Caribbean. The American Southwest is just not that far away; extensive trade between the Anasazi and civilizations along the Gulf Coast, and the steamy jungles of Southern Mexico, is archaeologically attested to.

Seemingly frozen in time, conditions at Chaco don’t fit many traditional abandonment theories. Archeologists discovered sandals hanging on pegs, lots of painted pottery left behind, corn in granaries, stuff laying around, like turquoise and pendants, that presumably would have been taken if they had gradually moved on with premeditation. If drought, plague or famine pressured them into leaving, wouldn’t they have relocated with more of their things? Throughout the Southwest, and particularly at Chaco, it’s as though the Anasazi fell into a zombie-trance, pushed away from the table, and walked out the front door.

But even that scenario is unworthy of the silver screen. In my version of events, in a time when the 12th-century Toltec civilization of southern Mexico was waning, Toltec warriors invaded the fabled north-lands bent on conquest and mayhem. Following ancient trade routes, then fanning out across New Mexico’s San Juan Basin, the hungry hordes with a taste for human flesh made for Chaco Canyon which they had heard so much about. Once they reached the Southwest the drought was in full swing, food sources were depleted, and the only thing left to eat were the Anasazi.

As the wave of horror rolled across the high desert, the Anasazi fled before them, not walking away, but running for their lives, leaving everything behind; sandals on pegs, pendants and turquoise and all of that wonderful pottery. Stories of brutality and bloody feasts of roasted brains and grilled quadriceps began as rumor largely unheeded, until the telling simply could not be ignored.

From Chaco Canyon and regions all around, the swifter, more prudent Anasazi relocated to distant, remote canyons, well-hidden mesas, and there they remained among the juniper and pinion pine trees near more dependable water sources, way up high on the sides of towering cliffs where they dwelt in homes easily defended; all they had to do was pull up the ladder.

As for the advancing Toltec, after the last of the locals were tenderized and devoured, or run off, there was no reason to stay, nothing left to eat. All the land was a dust bowl, and there remained no one to rule over and oppress. So gradually, with bellies filled and curiosity about the land up north satisfied, the Toltec, picking the Anasazi out of their teeth, melted back to southern Mexico and the land of pineapples and scarlet Macaws, and old Yellow Beard.

But not before they took the big prize, the famed metropolis at Chaco Canyon, and particularly the Great House called Pueblo Bonito; everyone had heard of Pueblo Bonito. Exercising stealth, the demonic-looking Toltec warriors decorated in facial paint, and wearing strands of human teeth draped around their necks, swarmed over the low walls and climbed over the high walls, ran across the plaza and dropped down into sunken, round kivas, clubbing and crushing and cutting as they went.

Lighting the dark way with burning torches in one hand, and forks in the other, a group of twenty crept down the maze of narrow hallways in single file, going door to door, room to room. And then they stopped at 318-B and knocked politely. No one answered. They knocked again.

Jane and Joe froze in mid-argument. It was probably just the neighbor wanting to borrow another cup of pinion nuts. Slightly peeved at being interrupted, Jane stomped over to the door, got up on her tipi-toes and peeked through the peep-hole. Then she stopped breathing. In a panic she spun around, threw her back against the door and blurted to her husband: “It’s for you.”",http://canadafreepress.com/article/the-ruins-of-chaco-canyon-in-northwest-new-mexico,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
9153,10348,Armed guards in schools,"The recent school shooting in Connecticut was a national tragedy. As the father of 7 children, I can comprehend the extreme pain and suffering that the families are enduring as a result of this senseless murder of children by a mentally disturbed young man. I am also an endowment member of the National Rifle Association (NRA).

The NRA is correct that the only way to prevent future tragedies is to place armed guards in every school in America. We in the NRA should have been unrelenting in efforts and demands for armed school guards over the past 30 years. Gun control and gun bans are ineffective failures just as illegal drug bans and laws are. Criminals and the mentally deranged simply do not obey laws. If the ownership and manufacture of all firearms were totally banned in America they would be smuggled in from foreign countries and available. Americans should have learned a lesson from the failure of prohibition of alcohol in the 1920’s.

Many of the politicians and liberals who support draconian gun bans are men who profess to be supporters of women’s equality. Males are seldom victims of rape. The invention and development of firearms and especially handguns has furthered the equality of women more than any invention in the history of the human race. The handgun allows a woman to defend herself against larger and more powerful males. Many wealthy politicians who demand gun bans and refuse to issue carry permits to ordinary and poorer citizens are hypocrites who have armed body guards and ride in chauffeured cars.

Violence and mass killings did not begin when firearms were invented. In ancient times, swords, knives, spears, clubs, and bow and arrows were quite effective. Most people have heard the old saying “Cut off your nose to spite your face”. In the 700-1100 AD era the Norsemen (Vikings) were raiding other European countries including France. Women actually cut off their noses to try to avoid rape. If these women had been armed with handguns these mighty warriors could not have so easily violated them.

Guns do not kill people and require a person to pull the trigger. But a firearm is an extremely efficient tool that makes killing very easy. Firearms ownership is a tremendous responsibility and firearms owners should police themselves and try to prevent children, mentally disturbed individuals, and criminals from acquiring guns. Gun safes are available in all sizes including high tech units that open only to the owners fingerprint.

America’s first president, George Washington, stated “Firearms are second in importance only to the Constitution; they deserve a place with all that is honorable”. President Thomas Jefferson understood that there is an “Evil Tendency” in government and said “The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government”. “Those who would give up freedom for the promise of safety will soon have and deserve neither”. Hitler told the German people “Give up your guns, we will make your streets safe and the world will follow our lead into the future”. Dictators always disarm citizens and reduce them to the status of subjects and then persecution begins.

There is a limit to the level of power and force that citizens should be allowed to own. No rational individual believes that nuclear weapons of mass destruction should be allowed ownership by a citizen. There is debate and controversy as to whether high capacity semi-automatic firearms exceed the allowable limit. These firearms are used in numerous sporting events nationwide and are used for self defense. In the case of riots or disasters they are needed for self defense and the protection of property and as a last resort against foreign invasion or domestic insurrection or government tyranny.

I do concede that there are too many firearms in the hands of irresponsible, unstable, and criminal individuals. We in the NRA are often accused of being unreasonable and unwilling to agree to “reasonable gun control”. The unreasonable politicians and activists who want to ban or severely restrict all firearms ownership force us to be uncompromising. Some radical politicians use firearms tragedy to further their agenda of unrestricted government control over the lives of American citizens (a total police state).

Some believe that only the government and police under their control should be allowed to own and carry firearms. But as America’s founding fathers noted, government cannot be trusted and must be held in check if tyranny is to be avoided. Power corrupts and absolute power absolutely corrupts. Were not the innocent children murdered at Waco Texas in 1993 by the U.S. government just as precious as those in Connecticut? President Obama and Sec. of State Hillary Clinton support and have endorsed the UN plan to disarm all citizens worldwide.

Firearms are used an estimated 2 to 2-1/2 million times each year in America to stop or prevent murder, assault, rape, theft, robbery, and other crimes. Yet the politicians and individuals who would disarm private citizens are quite ready and willing to return the human race to the dark days of the ancient past when the strong, the young, and the many controlled and violated the weak, the old, and the few.

6300,7206,A Lesson in “Marriage Equality”,"When the idea of same-sex “marriage” was first soft pedaled to the gullible masses, the pitch was, “ What can it possibly matter to you if two men or two women wed?” As Glenn Beck said, “If it neither breaks my leg nor picks my pocket, what difference is it to me ?”

Since then conservatives and evangelical business owners have learned the difference it makes and why it matters: It can mean an end to their small businesses, it can mean their church institutions including schools and adoption agencies can no longer be run according to biblical principles, and it can mean the loss of their jobs if they work as a Fox sports analyst, a CEO for Mozilla’s web browser Firefox, or as a contractor with Ford Motor Company.

Will Americans stand behind the Constitutional protections for people of conscience and conviction to live their lives and run their institutions in accord with their faith, or will they stand by and allow state agencies to fire, fine, or imprison anyone who finds same-sex “marriage” objectionable?

The Gaystapo message to evangelicals and conservatives isn’t the once-heralded live-and-let-live proverb; it’s the ISIS shout to the infidel, “Renounce your faith or die!”",http://canadafreepress.com/article/a-lesson-in-marriage-equality,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
7470,8505,The war on terrorism VS. the war on tourism!,"CAIRO, EGYPT —The Sinai peninsula is divided into two parts… Their Northern part is located along the border with Israel and the Palestinian Gaza Strip. It is the part that witnesses the battles against terrorists and the tunnels used for smuggling arms, drugs and criminals.

Today, the difficult task is to find ten tourists walking on the same street at the same time. Even more difficult is the task of the owners of those hotels and tourist facilities to be able to survive and keep their businesses open and to pay the salaries of their employees. This is despite the fire sale discounts offered to attract tourists, which has reached a level that a tourist pays less than one thousand dollars for airline tickets and full accommodation in Five Star hotels.

Last week I went there to work, but was shocked when I saw the sharp decline in the numbers of tourists. In the past, finding a place to sleep in any hotel of any level was a hard job. Virtually all of the hotels and rooms were booked constantly for months in advance, and despite the large increase in the numbers of new hotels which have been built, they had bookings and reservations up to 130%… It became a hard task just to walk in the streets because of the large numbers of tourists in cities like Sharm el- Sheikh and Dahab.

The Southern half is the part which has drawn tourists from all over the world to enjoy the magical nature, stunning coastlines, offering wonderful safari adventures, diving, and even healing at spas and worship as well, all making the Southern Sinai a major target for all kinds of tourism, entertainment and fun. Located in Southern Sinai; the mountain from which God spoke to Moses. It is the place where Jesus Christ and his mother the Virgin Mary lived for a while, looking for safety from the Romans.

During my stay in the charming area, bad news came about an attack on a bus full of Korean tourists from the city of ​​Taba, located in the far north of the Sinai. The tourists suffered minor injuries, while three policemen, the bus driver and the suicide bomber died. The incident ended all hope to restore tourism in South Sinai any time soon.

Directly after the attack, terrorists declared that they will give tourists in southern Sinai just four days to leave… or else!

As a result of the political instability and daily protests in Egypt—which usually end in violence, coupled with the brief rule of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt frightening off tourists, contributed to a serious decline in tourism. The final blow came recently with terrorists declaring an economic war, though more like a war on terrorism VS. the war on tourism. The goal is to destroy this important revenue stream. Egypt depends on tourism—in large part—the foreign currency such as Dollars, Euros and Pounds. As far as revenue for Egypt, tourism ranks right behind the Suez Canal.

The terrorists aim to punish people for the overthrow of the Brotherhood rule, and punish the army and police, who arrested leaders of the Brotherhood and seized their funding sources. They also wish to weaken the state and provoke people against the government if it cannot meet their economic needs— considered the most important reasons for the two Egyptian revolutions.

From what I witnessed myself on the streets, in the markets and hotels of Sinai, I can say that terrorists have sadly succeeded in achieving their goal. I heard a lot of stories from business owners and tourists about the impact of those threats and bombings on the state of present and future tourism in the Sinai especially and Egypt in general.

Marlies Lang, a German diver who has worked and lived in Dahab for 12 years, says: since the first revolution, the number of tourists has decreased dramatically, despite deep discounts offered by tourist facilities. Without tourists it is hard to cover expenses and to keep business open. The recent threats have influenced tourists negatively, although while there, I did not see many of them leaving. But many reservations have been canceled, and some famous newspapers and websites in Germany and Britain have been publishing warnings against coming to Egypt. I have already started getting calls from Europe asking me about the situation, wanting assurances Egypt its safe after the dire media warnings.

Lang adds that she personally was never afraid at all in Dahab and always feels it as a safe place, but today she doesn’t know what to say to those who ask her whether to come to Egypt or not for the first time.

A lot of countries are putting Egypt on the danger list for tourists, which, in my opinion, is an overreaction because what happens in Egypt could happen anywhere, and the security situation here is getting more stable by day. Even with a strong police and army at work, no one can prevent crime before it happens 100% of the time. That only happens in science fiction stories or in utopia.",http://canadafreepress.com/article/the-war-on-terrorism-vs.-the-war-on-tourism,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
3505,4027,Old School Parenting at Christmastime,"I remember, my Roy Roger’s pistol and holster. On Christmas day, I left my pistol outside for a moment. When I came back, it was gone. Mom was extremely annoyed at me.

The arrival of the Montgomery Wards catalog was a major exciting event. Each of us kids circled the toys we wanted for Christmas.

Like millions of lower to middle income American families back in the day, my parents did an awesome job at Christmastime. With little money, they always found a way to give their kids happy Christmases. As the 9-year-old eldest, I babysat my 4 siblings. I knew mom and dad did not have a lot of money. And yet, I never thought we were poor or felt shortchanged at Christmas. I don’t remember my 3 brothers and sister ever feeling shortchanged at Christmas. How awesome is that? Given their financial challenges, my parents had to be magicians to pull off that trick. Somehow, they performed their magic every year. I kind of took it for granted. Looking back, all I can say is, “Wow!”

I felt my Aunt Bummie and her 5 sons living on welfare were poor. Mom, dad, we 5 kids, Aunt Bummie and her 5 boys sat around a table, feasting on a mountain of fried chicken necks and backs. They were dirt cheap to buy. We laughed, joked and had a wonderful time. God has blessed me to travel the world, enjoying numerous five star dining experiences. I still love fried chicken necks and backs.

One Christmas when we were still living in the Baltimore government housing project, I found a used bicycle hidden deep in the closet. I knew the bike was my Christmas present. I was elated because I knew mom and dad could not afford it. Mom was disappointed that I saw the bike. I told her I was a big boy and wanted to help her and dad play Santa; setting up the gifts Christmas eve for my younger siblings. She said, “Okay”.

Then there was the Christmas we could have died. In 1952, the restriction of blacks being allowed to take the test to become Baltimore City firefighters ended. Dad became a firefighter. We moved out of the projects. My parents purchased a home in a small black suburban community; Pumphrey, Maryland. It was Christmas eve. Dad had to work the night shift at the fire house. Mom decided to paint a room with oil based paint. Dad came home 7 a.m. Christmas morning to find us all passed out. He rescued us by carrying us to the front porch. We recovered and opened presents.

My wife Mary said her parents were pretty awesome as well. They always found a way to make room and feed relatives in need. Mary’s immediate family consisted of her parents and 3 siblings. And yet, Mary recalls washing dishes for as many as 11 people living in their home. She has wonderful childhood Christmas memories. Although, she has been scared for life regarding washing dishes. Mary cooks and I wash the dishes. Our kitchen remodel will include a dishwasher.

Old school American parents were awesome. They were responsible early in their adulthood, doing whatever needed to be done. My baby-boomer generation seems to be pretty spoiled and self focused.

At 29 years old, my Dad fathered his 5 kids and tried to be a stand-in father/role model for my Aunt Bummie’s five boys. They loved my dad and envied me for having him.

I’m getting choked up.

Mom passed away 20 years ago. Our family’s 2017 annual Christmas Eve gathering was wonderful. Everyone shared a spirit of making merry. Last year, Dad declared me the new patriarch of the family. At this year’s gathering, I called for a round of applause for my late mom and 89-year-old dad, thanking them for all the great Christmases.

I pray y’all had a Merry Christmas. Have a Happy and Blessed New Year!",http://canadafreepress.com/article/old-school-parenting-at-christmastime,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

1682,1925,Henry’s 1-millionth rimfire lever action up for grabs at SHOT auction (VIDEO),"Henry’s 1-millionth rimfire lever action up for grabs at SHOT auction (VIDEO)

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

In December, Henry Repeating Arms manufactured its one-millionth lever-action .22-caliber rifle in their flagship model H001. As with all Henry products, it was “made in America or not made at all.” And this particular rifle has high aspirations of setting a record, having been selected by the NSSF as SHOT Show’s auction rifle. Guns.com had the chance to sit down with Henry’s president and owner Anthony Imperato to get the scoop.

The hand-finished rimfire features a silver receiver with hand-engraved scroll patterns, done by the Connecticut-based Baron Engraving. The engraving is embellished with inlaid 24-carat gold. The whole package is dressed with some of the finest AAA exhibition-grade American Walnut stocks we’ve ever seen, and which, according to Imperato, is “one of the finest examples of American walnut ever to leave our factory.”

The company has come a long way since the first Henry lever action .22 rifle shipped out of the original factory in Brooklyn in 1997. After a move, expansion, and the addition of many more models, Henry now cranks out a full line of rimfires, big bores, and even shotguns from their plants in Bayonne, New Jersey and Rice Lake, Wisconsin.

“When I attended the SHOT Show in 1996 I displayed the prototype H001 on an eight-foot folding table. We didn’t have a big budget booth and it was a no-frills affair. I had no idea that it would go on to be a top seller, a staple of the firearms industry,” Imperato said. “My goal was to deliver value, quality, a smooth reliable action and of course, made in America.”

And boy, did he succeed. Imperato estimates his company has more than two-million H001 series rifles when counting the many variations, calibers, and options available, but there is only one that will ever be labeled the millionth serial number.

While the majority of noteworthy serial numbers, #1 or #1,000,000 usually end up on a museum display, this one is headed for a private home. “This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to own a piece of firearms history,” Imperato said, adding proceeds from the auction benefit organizations that support conservation, hunting, firearms safety, shooting sports programs and the Second Amendment.

What does this mean for the family run Henry Repeating Arms? “This is the rifle that put Henry Repeating Arms on the map, energized the lever action market and resurrected the Henry name,” Imperato said. “Hitting the one-million milestone validates that we have done something right. I couldn’t be more humbled by the incredible response and support Henry has received over the past two decades. I remain forever grateful to our customers, distributors, dealers and our employees.”

Henry’s goal is to exceed the SHOT Show auction record of $136,014. At the time of publication, the millionth Henry rifle has been hit by over 150 bidders to the tune of $55,000 on GunBroker. Not only does the winner take ownership of the fine rifle, but will also be a special guest of the company at the 2018 NRA Convention in Dallas.

Interested bidders with deep pockets can find the gun here. The auction closes on Jan. 26, when we’ll find out if Henry Repeating Arms claims the auction crown.

There I stood with my mouth open in disbelief on a small rise at the edge of rolling prairie near the southern end of Montana’s Rocky Mountain Front. Catching my breath, I listened to loud rumbling as the earth quivered beneath the split hooves of mule deer in the hundreds thundering off in a bounding panic through twisted jack pine and brittle, tan grass and prickly pear. They ran for their lives, those beautiful mulies, through rolling foothills near towering cliffs at the entrance to the Sun River Canyon 20 miles west of Augusta - the greatest little cow town in the American West.

I continued my climb, relying on hands and bruised knees the higher I scrambled through stony debris toward a notch at the edge of a sprawling bench, way up there, beyond a steep, corrugated flank of scarred rock, a sheer wall that faces out across the rolling brown plains at rest beneath hard blue December skies, snow-less and empty and vast beyond measure.

He could have set up shop any place his heart desired but picked the sunny side of the state, the windy side, where few people live and big ranches thrive and serious crime is rare and miles of open space and fresh air fill your lungs under a very big sky; where quiet country roads set the tone for wholesome living and a good life, and land is relatively cheap and plentiful, and folks are decent and pretty much leave you alone if that’s your pleasure. Americans, driving pickups.

Their massive curled horns were as thick as my thighs, their stout legs stomping as they veered toward a much larger herd of ewes and young ones likewise crowding each other apprehensively and moving off to safety; two hundred I surmised, probably more, members of one of this country’s largest herd of bighorns who winter along the Sun River corridor. I crouched low, peered over the ridge and watched as they shuffled out of sight, my jaw dropping for the second time that day. And that’s when I decided, right then and there, that I was going to make the Rocky Mountain Front my home.

In July of 1806, Meriwether Lewis and his men of Lewis and Clark fame spent a few nights camping near Augusta, commending the area for its “extensive, beautiful and level bottom.” He got that right. Not sure if Augusta’s cottonwoods were as thick back then as they are today; big, fat beautiful trees, grand old dames growing tall along the river and over in the park, offering welcome shade in summer and something fine to look at any time of year, especially during brisk yellow autumn.

Augusta’s history reaches back centuries. A Blackfoot Indian travois trail ran down today’s Main Street, and after they were run off, freight wagons and a stage rolled through, followed more recently by occasional Highway 287 traffic, but not much. In the old days when the likes of John Wayne straddled the saddle it was known as a stockman’s paradise, big-time cattle country due to the abundance of feed and native grasses along the river and elsewhere that fattened enormous herds for slaughter.

History testifies there were a half a million head at one time right around here, munching free grass and fertilizing the rocky soil with a plop and a splatter as they waited patiently to be shipped off, stripped of their hides, drained, and carved into thick T-bone steaks or ground to ruby-red pulp.

Tourists driving up from Helena on the way to Glacier National Park do themselves a disservice bypassing this historic gem as they roar down the interstate toward Great Falls in their haste. Don’t be one of them. Hop off the I-15 at Wolf Creek and glide on up the newly resurfaced and widened highway through country that will take your breath away and stick a tear in your eye on account of the beauty; classic Montana scenery, a rolling, convoluted country with nary a tree, a good land that resembles an angry ocean frozen in the moment, a portrait of hills and dales and twisting long valleys and draws and bumps and lumps and low ridges and high crowns; contours accentuated particularly well at morning light. And as green as Ireland in late spring and early summer.

Wild West Indian country. Clean country with few fences, and mountains of the Continental Divide off to the left and sharp hills to the right as you drive north from Wolf Creek, with the slow turns of the shrouded Dearborn River beckoning, perfect and pretty, especially on the drive up to Rogers Pass. But please, do not ram into our beautiful deer at 70 miles an hour, and you WILL if you’re not careful. They gather at dawn and graze near dusk by the side of the road, and invariably jump out when you least expect them. I know, regrettably.

If you can pull it off, plan your summer visit to Augusta (pop. 300) during the oldest and largest one-day PRCA rodeo in Montana held each summer on the last Sunday in June. It’s a kick in the pants, let me tell you, and the real deal. I’ve never seen so many cowboy hats and pointy boots in such a small place in my life. Horses, horse trailers and half-ton trucks line both sides of every street. It’s a serious, raucous affair and everyone’s invited. No need to chew and spit or mangle your East Coast vocabulary to attend. Just watch where you step.

When you’re not being entertained by cowboys sailing upside-down through the air, take the opportunity to get up close and personal with the rough stock out back, those massive bulls locked up in their pens, just standing there waiting to gore someone’s spleen. Smell them. Stare them down. Snap a photo. Even more fun is tiptoeing around crushed beer cans and psychedelic piles of orange vomit on Main Street in front of the Western Bar Sunday morning, evidence of a rowdy good time Saturday night, unless you’re the one who got beat up by some drunk, out-of-town redneck spoiling for a fight at two in the morning. Billy Bob could be his name, and with a belly full of brew he might take issue with your Obama-Biden bumper sticker, your tattered long hair and your commie ways, if you know what I mean.

Just passing through town? Make sure to stop for ice cream or burgers at Mel’s Diner, walk across the street for some respectable fine art and crafts at Latigo & Lace, and step into the Manix Trading Post where they’ve got everything, I kid you not, stacked to the ceiling; clothing, hardware, groceries, fishing tackle, you name it. Booze. Their motto is, “If we don’t have it, you don’t need it,” or something along those lines. And don’t forget gas; it’s a long way between pumps.





The golden eagle caught my attention as it hopped toward the young tundra swan that was obviously in trouble, limping and flapping its wings in distress. I watched the drama unfold on the grassy plain through the kitchen window and decided to interfere with the natural course of events and save that extraordinarily large but innocent bird from an ugly fate. After we chased off the raptor and snapped my new friend’s picture, I sort of wrapped the swan in a blanket, wrestled him or her (wasn’t sure what to look for) into the front seat as it beat me upside the head with those massive wings, and drove back to our place where it lived in the bathtub for two days while we made arrangements to haul him down to the bird sanctuary in Helena. I don’t recall what I fed that poor animal, but cleaning up after that mess was one humbling experience I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. Come to think of it, I probably should have just plucked him and fried him up.

Just kidding. It’s not only grizzly bear wandering out of the million-acre Bob Marshall Wilderness onto the plains, or the great herds of elk wintering on the 20,000-acre Sun River Wildlife Management Area, or skittish pronghorn antelope racing at breakneck speed across the barrens, or 128-mile-an-hour winds that will scare you to death, that make this place so welcoming to outdoor enthusiasts and wildlife lovers. They’ve got birds, a bunch of them, especially at 1,500-acre Willow Creek Reservoir northwest of Augusta. It’s popular with fishermen, and though we’ve moved on since those memorable good old days, the spectacle reminded us each spring that we were living someplace special. The numbers are mind-boggling; geese, swans, every-which-kind of duck, some eagles, an eclectic mix of shorebirds too varied to list, and my all-time favorite, white pelicans, the Forrest Gump of the birding world.

But if you really want something to write home about visit Freezeout Lake in spring, just a few miles southeast of Choteau near Fairfield where 10,000 migrating tundra swans and 300,000 snow geese drop in on stubbled grain fields in early April or thereabouts. With the snow-capped Rocky Mountain Front as a backdrop, and the rush of pounding wings deafening, bearing witness to this flying carpet of white roaring to life and darkening the sky with their shifting mass will get your heart pounding, make you weak in the knees. And no, that’s not manna from heaven falling from the sky.

I sure do like Willie Nelson, but it’s a shame they ran out of those free tickets so quickly when he played Choteau on July 3, 2007, the summer Montana melted as temperatures soared well above 100 F and stayed there. Rumor has it old what’s-his-name foot the bill and brought Willie and the boys to town for a gig that had the locals giddy for weeks. As we wandered around the bustling arts and crafts festival leading up to the big event, that’s all anyone talked about, grinning ear-to-ear, bubbly with anticipation, friendly, happy. Choteau’s famous adopted son really endeared himself with that generous gesture of appreciation.

Compared to tiny Augusta, Choteau, twenty-five miles to the north, feels downright metropolitan with 1,700 residents, a supermarket, at least one bank, a lumberyard and a hospital and airport and wide streets and good schools and a big old courthouse. But before you fill up and drive on, stop at the Old Trail Museum at the north end of town where they’ve set up a wonderful world into the past. Not merely pioneer log cabin replicas and reminders of our Wild West heritage, but tributes to A.B. Guthrie (1901-1991) who penned “The Big Sky” and won the Pulitzer Prize for “The Way West.” The Front is also home to fossils and dinosaur eggs in the foothills twenty miles west of Highway 89. This was all a massive inland sea way back when, and dinosaurs roamed in great numbers along the shore.

If you know your paleontology, and I don’t, you’ve heard of Egg Mountain and its dinosaur eggs, nests and baby dinosaurs, which evidently are quite rare. You can get to the mountain called Egg by driving north a few miles and heading west 20 miles along the only paved road leading to the Front. Egg Mountain is off to the south somewhere. I’d get a map if I were you and ask for directions. The road continues on into the mountains through a cliff-strewn, narrow canyon along the Teton River. Follow the signs and you’ll even find a 400-acre ski area at the end of the road, the Teton Pass Ski Resort, if you can believe that.

Near the foothills you’ll see a small subdivision as you approach the mountains, on the south side of the river mostly, and nearby is where A.B. Guthrie lived those many years of his productive literary life. He called it his “point of outlook on the universe,” a place where grizzlies wandering out of the Rockies strolled through his backyard no doubt, and brutal winds crippled the trees, and life was calm and meaningful, and the worrisome details of the outside world, distant.

7320,8348,Dollar Collapse? World Bank Whistleblower Predicts Global Currency,"Gregg Prescott, M.S., In5D Guest

Waking Times

According to World Bank whistleblower Karen Hudes, the US dollar is set to crash and will be replaced with a new, interest free, gold-backed currency.

Hudes is a lawyer that worked in the World Bank legal department and has been recently reinstated by the 188 Ministers of Finance on the Board of Governors on the World Bank

In an interivew with Russia Today, Hudes stated, “there is 170,500 metric tons of gold deposited in a vault in the Bank of Hawaii, 130,500 metric tons in AMEX Hong Kong plus 150,000 metric tons in Development Bank of Singapore, for a total of 451,000 metric tons. There is an additional amount exceeding 100,000 metric tons in other American banks”.

In 1950, Ferdinand Marcos kept this gold in a secret trust fund for 50 years “so all the claims on the world’s wealth would be subject to the statute of limitations, which basically says that if somebody claims that they own something, but they haven’t been able to gain control of it for 50 years, then they’ve lost their claim. The purpose was so that all of the assets that were put in trust for humanity when the 50 year period ended, would be available for humanity without any competing claims. That 50 year period ended in 2005.”

The authorized signatory for the trust fund is Wolfgang Struck.



Hudes stated, “Considering that the paper currencies are in a precarious situation, we need to step up our game and to move quickly to bring the gold out of the trust fund for the benefit for the benefit of humanity before the collapse of the paper currencies.”

What is the hold up?

According to Hudes, the mainstream media has been bought up by the banks, which is delaying the movement forward of information outside of the alternative news media. Outside of the alternative news, people can use social media outlets such as Twitter and Facebook to get the word out. “More people are learning about the fact that the banks are trying to prevent people from getting the wealth that they’re entitled to.”

Despite being reinstated, Hudes admitted that she is not able to go into the World Bank buildings because “the banking cartel has hired… owns a security firm which refuses to let me in, although I did manage to get into a meeting on the 10th of October (2014), which is when I met with three delegations… the Swiss, the Russian and the German delegations and we discussed about how we were going to get the banks to follow the banking laws.”

“Numerous coalitions have formed, such as the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and the Group of 77 (which is actually 130 developing countries) to help releases these gold funds to humanity.”

In the United States, those citizens and local governments that understand that the banking cartel has done something called “state capture” to which Hudes says, “They managed to bribe and corrupt enough officials, that these officials would just, instead of doing their public duty, would serve the interests of the banking cartel.”

In the United States, Hudes has been working with “The County Executives of America” and stated that they “have accepted the share of the United States gold in this ‘Global Debt Facility’ on behalf of the citizens of the United States and we are now trying to replace the paper currencies that are issued by the Federal Reserve.” Hudes added that the new currency should be issued by the Treasury, not the Fed, and stated there will not be any interest (debt) on the new currency. In other words, charging interest will no longer be tolerated in ANY country once these funds are released.

“When Ferdinand Marcos put the gold in the Global Debt Facility, he arranged for institutions that would be there to ensure that the gold would benefit humanity when it came out and one of those institutions is the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.”

Hudes stated that most of this gold is located in the Philippines and the US Military is guarding that area. Wolfgang Struck stated that some military helicopters were flying gold out of that area, so Hudes filed a claim with the Inspector General in Okinawa stating that the gold was insured by Lloyd’s of London and the Lincoln Insurance Company. The terms of Hudes’ claim included that “any gold that is stolen will be put back and that anybody that ordered the transport of that gold is going to be held accountable as well.”

What are the challenges?

Hudes stated there are several main challenges to overcome before the new currency is issued:

1. To quickly replace the currencies

2. The banks have bought up the main stream media and are misinforming the people regarding this situation

Hudes stated the Federal Reserve Notes “are going to crash and it’s not going to be possible to do anything systematically after that happens.”

The U.S. military would be affected as well. “If the paper currency crashes, there’s no way to pay for the military.”

Hudes’ email from Wolfgang Struck

On November 3rd, 2014, Hudes received an email from Wolfgang Struck stating:

“This is interesting news in the sense that Karen Hudes is heading the demolition team that will replace the fractional reserve currencies, before their imminent collapse, in a peaceful transition through monetary agreements that the world does not know. It hurts to repeat the last sentence that follows: We will be watching with heightened interests as we do not have the slightest idea how that would be accomplished.”

Hudes wrote back stating that “the world does know about the monetary agreements” adding that those in power are still buying into the false reality portrayed by the mainstream media.

The new currency

According to Hudes, the new currency will be like this:

“The gold will be pressed very thin and put between a plastic envelope which will act just like paper currency, except that the value of the gold will be equal to the stated value of the currency.” Regarding the price of gold, it will be calculated by “using historical baskets of good and services and also the major currencies at the time so that we will have an absolute equivalent in our currency of the true value of whatever it is that the currency is being used for. We’ll also have local currencies and we will no longer be controlled by our currencies or pay interests on country debt in a scam.”

“It’s a race. If we do not replace this fake, fractional paper currency with value, we’re going to go into another dark age. We’ve got a coalition that understands this very well and that coalition is much stronger than the banking cartel.”

In5D Addendum: One must ask if Federal Reserve’s 100 year charter ended, then why are they still allowed to continue doing business as “normal”?

I asked the above question on Karen’s YouTube channel and she responded, “Because their charter was for unlimited duration.”

In further research, I found that in the McFadden Act of 1927, Congress rechartered the Federal Reserve Banks into perpetuity, and so there is currently no “expiration date” or repeal date for the Federal Reserve.

Another question that arises is why did the World Bank reinstitute Hudes after all of the turmoil she’s caused for them?

Also, with the rash of bankster suicides, why is she allowed to speak out and what is the overall agenda?

I messaged Karen on Facebook and asked her these questions. This was her response:

“Because the World Bank was dominated by the banking cartel, and the countries took back control. I am protected by the US military, who know I am cleaning the traitors from their ranks. The overall agenda is to avoid the bankster-caused WWIII.”

For those with their ears to the ground, you already know about current systems where we can all live in abundance and prosperity without the need for money, including the Ubuntu system and the Venus Project. What Hudes is proposing would simply be a short-term transition until all forms of money are eliminated because as long as there is money, we’re ALL financial slaves to a broken system.

676,767,Ohio Man On Vacation In Costa Rica Rescues Baby From Certain Death (video),"Travelling in South America will bring you into contact with some surprising wildlife. You may encounter bugs and spiders you never thought existed crawling all over you in the dead of night. Or equally scary is the chance run-in you may have with wild cats in the mountains as you venture along in a tour guided vehicle or your transportation vehicle of choice. Sometimes the interactions with nature can actually be quite serene – like the time Dirk Morgan found a struggling sloth and rescued it.

Dirk Morgan would be the first to admit he has seen a lot of what nature has to offer. Having taken many nature trips with his wife over the years, the couple from Ohio expected their trip to Costa Rica to be filled with some excitement – but they could never have predicted what they would find.

On this one occasion, the Morgans found a struggling sloth on the shoreline unable to make it’s way to safety.

The Morgans live and run the Jungle Lodge in Peurto Jimenez in Costa Rica. The lodge is located on the Osa Peninsula which, as it happens, is one of the most biodiverse habitats left on earth. The Morgans call this territory their home and have come to appreciate the wide variety of life forms hovering around them at all times.

It was still curious one Monday morning for them to hear a strange sound coming from the rocks on the ocean. They ventured down and found a baby sloth underneath some of the rocks and clinging on for dear life.

The Morgans pointed out that strong rains had come overnight and must surely have caused some commotion. While it was unclear how exactly this little guy ended up nestled between the rocks, it was clear that help was needed otherwise imminent death was in its future. Dirk said that if the sloth had been there for even an hour long it would have made a nice lunch for the stray dogs who roam the coastline looking for scraps.

The Morgans gathered all the supplies they needed to help the little guy find his way back to the jungle. They brought a box, a warm towel, and fresh water to the ailing sloth to give it the support and energy boost it needed to make it back home.

It just so happened that help was close by. The Morgan’s Jungle Lodge is located next door to an animal sanctuary run by Paul Tudor Jones, a wealthy hedge fund manager and founder of the Robin Hood Foundation. It was no problem for the sanctuary to take the ailing sloth into their care and rehabilitate it accordingly.

Photos of the whole excursion posted by the Morgans show all the stages of rescue that went down. By the end of it all, when the sloth is in the warm care of the preservationists, a photo was taken that makes it seem like the little guy is smiling! You would not need to convince the Morgans that the natural wildlife has its mysterious ways of communicating with humans.",http://awm.com/ohio-man-on-vacation-in-costa-rica-rescues-baby-from-certain-death-video/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

“Diversity is our strength,” tweeted Canada’s Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau recently, and so say all of us: the politicians, the celebrities, the teachers, the campaigners, the media and even government. Who amongst us then could argue with such an overwhelming body of opinion?

After all, Mr Trudeau and friends are unshakeable in their conviction: Diversity is our strength. Case closed. Or is it?

Slogans are powerful things, short, snappy, persuasive and seemingly incontrovertible in their wisdom. When the novelist George Orwell created 1984, his vision of a dystopian, totalitarian society of the future, slogans of the ruling party were very much in evidence: “Ignorance is strength!” “War is Peace!” “Freedom is slavery!” Wherever they turned, citizens were met with slogans.

7483,8521,America’s Oldest Mall Now Contains 48 Charming Low-Cost Micro-Apartments,"Source: www.mymodernmet.com | Original Post Date: January 23, 2016 –

With online retailers making shopping an efficient, no-fuss experience, it’s no secret that brick-and-mortar malls aren’t as popular as they used to be. Yet, what’s to be done about the shopping malls that are no longer populated by crowds of shoppers? What can we do with structures like Arcade Providence, America’s oldest shopping mall and a National Historic Landmark? To solve such a dilemma, Northeast Collaborative Architects decided to stage a $7 million revival by transforming the Providence, Rhode Island space into mixed-use housing with 17 shops on the ground floor and 48 low-cost micro-apartments on the top two levels.

Starting at an affordable $550 a month, residents can rent an Arcade Providence, one-bedroom unit that’s 225 to 450 square feet in size. Inside, there’s a built-in bed, full bathroom, refrigerator, sink, microwave, dishwasher, seating, and storage. For more amenities, tenants can also use the shared TV room, game room, on-site laundry facility, bike storage area, or parking garage that’s located across the street. For those who would like more space, there’s also a two-bedroom and three-bedroom unit available. The only catch is that there’s a waiting list with about 4,000 people currently on it.

As for the building as a whole, it stays true to its original Greek Revival style. It resembles a light-filled atrium complete with regal columns that pay homage to its historic presence. It now serves as inspiration for all other shopping malls out there.

MONSTROUS PATENT CALLS PEOPLE “WET WARE”

HEWLETT-PACKARD & AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES ARE COMPLICIT

FIG. 1–RICHARD C. WALKER, AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES (PALO ALTO, CA) HOLDS MONSTROUS “INTERNET OF THINGS” PATENTS THAT CAN TAKE DOWN PLANES WITH REMOTE INSTRUCTIONS TO ONE LITTLE QRS-11 SENSOR IN THE AUTOPILOT SYSTEM. The global surveillance grid includes embedded chips in planes, devices, equipment and people to remotely send signals and control every element of The Internet of Things network. The QRS-11 quartz rate sensor (the diameter of a quarter; also see AbelDanger.org for more detail on the uninterruptable autopilot) is embedded in most aircraft autopilots. The intelligence version of the sensor can be turned off remotely and bring down the plane. In the late 1980′s and early 1990′s,

Hillary Clinton’s Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Arkansas was the original attorney representing the inventor of the QRS-11 sensor in BEI Electronics/Technologies (US Pat. Nos. 3,974,428; 3,976,997; 4,628,298). This sensor was so critical to national security that the State Department fined Boeing $16 million for illegal exports. After many mergers and company sales, the rights to the QRS-11 went to France for a decade owned by Schneider Electric SA. Schneider sold the rights to a Barclays Bank client in London. The Rose Law Partner who hired Hillary, J. Joseph Giroiri,

served on the BEI Technologies board of directors. He also coordinated the Clinton’s China and Indonesia banking connections associated with their Mena, Arkansas drug smuggling, money laundering and sex trafficking.

Barclays then sold the company and the QRS-11 patent rights to Sensata, Inc. which is controlled by Mitt Romney’s Goldman Sachs-aligned Bain Capital in Boston. Tellingly, dozens of former Clinton staff have died in mysterious airplane and vehicle crashes. Also telling, the late FBI Superstar Ted Gunderson, said in 2005 that Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVay had a bio chip surgically installed in him by Dr. Louis Jolyon “Jolly” West who led the rogue C.I.A.’s MKUltra mind control program. Conveniently for Bill and Hillary, the Oklahoma City bombing destroyed the records of the FBI investigation on Janet Reno’s WACO criminality. The bombing also killed former Clinton chief of security Alan G. Whicher. Four other Clinton’s bodyguards (C. LeBleu/T., T. McKeaham,, R. Williams,, S. Willis) were shot in the head by a helicopter sniper at the illegal military siege of the Branch Davidian property in Waco, Texas (1993). Some call these deaths “Arkancide” since most everyone associated with the Clintons in Arkansas, except Larry Nichols, have died. Nichols produced The Clinton Chronicles (1994) to expose the Clinton devilish corruption. Despite ill health, Larry carries on the struggle to bring the Clintons to justice.

UPDATE! JAN. 16, 2018

ETHERNET ENGINEERS—WHISTLEBLOW!

Most computer engineers have no idea how the IEEE 802.3 data transmission Ethernet standard was developed (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers). We have just discovered that it was shoved down our throats by Deep State shadow government forces intent on controlling the Internet as a global spy grid and corporatist profit machine. Richard C. Walker a.k.a Rick Walker was a stooge for Agilent Technologies who was evidently tapped by the Highlands Group to seize control of technology standards needed for the takeover. This post contains hard, indictable evidence that proves the identities of the corporatists involved with HP/Agilent, including 3Com, Qualcomm, Broadcom, Cisco, IBM, Sun, Intel, NTT (Japan Telephone), Cielo, Quake, nSerial, Nortel, World Wide Packets. See Jul. 10, 2000 IEEE meeting slides where Walker’s pushes standards proposed on Mar. 06, 2000—the same day he filed for a patent (became U.S. Pat. No. 6,718,491) on the same slides. Mindspring engineer Roy Bynumcomplained that Walker was railroading the standard. Of course, after filing his patent, Walker had a vested interest in having it become the IEEE standard for data transmission. It did, to this day.

Patents last for 20 years from the time they are filed. Walker assigned it to HP/Agilent Technologies. Then inexplicably, on Jun. 24, 2013, the Patent Office allowed an almost identical patent U.S. Pat. No. 9,451,057 on the 802.3 Ethernet standard by a subsidiary of Marvell International, Ltd. thru inventor Brett A. McClellan, a Bahamian corporation with offices in Colorado.The Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) overrode the Examiner Eric A. Myers (Art Unit 2474) who had ruled that Marvell’s filing was doubly unpatenable as being essentially a copy of Walker’s earlier dubious Ethernet patents. Walker filed eleven (11) patents assigned to Hewlett-Packard and fourteen (14) assigned toAgilent Technologies, Inc. The PTAB overruled Examiner Myers and awarded it to McClellan/Marvell anyway, void of substantive reasons, the PTAB (secret three-judge internal patent court) magically accepted ALL of Marvell’s previously rejected novelty arguments. Therefore, Marvell’s value appears to be fraudulent, yet they claim control of the 802.3 Ethernet standard driving all Internet data transmission. This evident corruption in the U.S. Patent Office shows it has become nothing but a rubber stamp for corporatists, and not a protector of American inventors.

(JAN. 11, 2017)—What AFI and American Intelligence Media (AIM) researchers have just discovered is breathtaking, disgusting, astounding and monstrous. It is also shocking how far along the plan is. Amazingly, the Deep State shadow government, in its evident hubris, has fully disclosed their diabolical technology scheme for “The Internet of Things” in writing.

The patent actually says that their plan is to identify, tag, track and control literally everything on the planet. Their unquestioned plan is to embed micro-electronic control devices, either surgically or by injection, in every human being on the planet. To them, it’s all about “management of the world’s resources” including you. Walker Patent No. 6,965,816 Col. 118, Lns. 53-54.

Why would they publish these plans? They evidently believed that these documents would not surface until after they had seized control.

UNBELIEVABLY, YOU ARE JUST “WET-WARE”

These documents show that their authors have a total disdain for humanity. These define people as “wet-ware.” In this world view, a human is merely a silicon chip surrounded by a membrane of carbon and water.

These are the people who are planning to take over the world.

Read for yourself:

Here are two lines captured from the actual patent:

FIG. 2–U.S. Patent No. 6,965,816, Col. 3, Lns. 5-6.

“PFN” means Protected Primary Focal Node. “TRAC” means Trusted Remote Activity Controller.

The illustrations in Walker’s patent are truly dystopian (a community or society that is undesirable and/or frightening)—and they have been implemented! Their message is clear: “you can run but you cannot hide.” In this illustration, even the trees are watching you! Here is Figure 21 from Walker’s patent.

PATENTS ARE INTENTIONALLY ARCANE AND HARD TO UNDERSTAND

For example, “inequitable conduct” means fraud, “prosecute” means make filings, “on-sale bar” means sell an invention too soon, “Markman” handles technical definitions, “pro hac vice” means an out-of-state attorney, “pro se” means means represent yourself, and so on.

Patent lingo insulates the “old boy” club of patent lawyers and judges from We The People accountability.

CATEGORIES OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

Patents are a form of intellectual property alongside trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks and trade dress. Here’s a thumbnail tutorial.

Trade secrets are anything you do or think that is not publicly known that you have taken reasonable means to protect, like the way you solve a problem or build something.

Copyrights are your thoughts reduced to some medium like pen, paper, program or design, like books, artwork, type or manuscripts.

Trademarks are unique names, phrases and other expressions used in commerce and assigned to you in order to avoid confusion in your marketplace. For example, it would be confusing to have two companies in your state with the same names.

Trade dress is the sum total of the way something is designed, like the unique colors and style used in a franchised store design and product packaging.

Finally, patents are unique and “nonobvious” inventions, methods and designs. Patents do not have to be working to be patentable. They just have to be described well enough to be repeatable by a person of “ordinary skill in the art.” We’ll describe what this means below.

PATENTS ARE UNIQUELY PROTECTED IN THE U.S. CONSTITUTION

Patents and copyrights are the only two property rights specifically protected by the U.S. Constitution, Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8. Indeed, the Founders protected inventors because new ideas are essential to creating new wealth. They also knew that innovations are fragile flowers that would otherwise be hijacked by greed, power and wealth if not protected.

Tragically, the patent system has been hijacked by many corrupt lawyers and judges who themselves steal from real inventors and grow rich in the process.

PATENTS ARE A PROPERTY DEED AND CONTRACT

A patent is a contract and a property deed. The contract is between We The People and the inventor. We give the inventor twenty years to exploit his or her idea for the benefit of society and to be rewarded for sharing the invention with the public.

The patent document itself describes the innovation. It’s like the “four corners” of a physical property deed (e.g., survey, terrain, frontage, roads, vegetation, water, drainage, utilities). Similarly, a patent describes an inventor’s new idea in words and diagrams.

A patent must contain enough detail to enable a third party with “ordinary skill in the art” to replicate it . . . ostensibly for the benefit of society. The expectation is that third party will license the underlying patent in the process of adding value to it.

RICHARD WALKER’S PATENT COULD NOT WORK WITHOUT LEADER TECHNOLOGIES’ SOCIAL NETWORKING INVENTION, SO THEY STOLE IT

Walker has not licensed the invention of social networking from Leader Technologies. Instead, as this Walker patent reveals, they just stole it.

Indeed, Walker’s patent would not have worked on the large scale they describe without Leader social networking invention. We’ll show that below.

Here’s the proof.

“Art” means the field of the invention, like computer hardware, software, furniture, machinery, medical device, pharmaceutical, consumer product, office product, tool, manufacturing method, agricultural implement, vehicle type, etc.

The Patent Office uses the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for the tens of thousands of “art” classifications. An inventor must describe his/her invention in enough detail so that one of ordinary skill in the patent classification being described can replicate it.

The Walker patent discussed below identified both U.S. and International industry classifications. See also “How do I read a patent? – the Front Page.”

A MONSTROUS FAMILY OF PATENTS

U.S. Patent Number 6,965,816 Nov. 15, 2005 “PFN/TRAC System FAA Upgrades For Accountable Remote and Robotics Control To Stop The Unauthorized Use of Aircraft and to Improve Equipment Management and Public Safety in Transportation.” Patent enabling the Deep State to crash most any aircraft Classification Description U.S. (U.S. Cl.) 701/16 DATA PROCESSING: VEHICLES, NAVIGATION, AND RELATIVE LOCATION / With indication or control of landing 701/2 DATA PROCESSING: VEHICLES, NAVIGATION, AND RELATIVE LOCATION, VEHICLE CONTROL, GUIDANCE, OPERATION, OR INDICATION, Remote control system 244/189 AERONAUTICS AND ASTRONAUTICS, AIRCRAFT CONTROL, Automatic, Electric course control, By remote radio signal International (Int.

WALKER U.S. Patent Number 6,965,816 Nov. 15, 2005 Classifications.

We recently uncovered U.S. Patent Number 6,965,816 (10.9 MB) awarded on Nov. 15, 2005 to the named sole inventor Richard C. Walker titled:

“PFN/TRAC System FAA Upgrades For Accountable Remote and Robotics Control To Stop The Unauthorized Use of Aircraft and to Improve Equipment Management and Public Safety in Transportation.”

While this patent focuses on aircraft, it is written so broadly as to encompass all kinds of equipment and devices, including people, defined as “wet-ware.”

While the patent was issued on Nov. 15, 2005, it incorporates filings going all the way back to Dec. 2, 1996.

Most patents incorporate provisional patents and related technology upon which they rely. AFI and American Intelligence Media (AIM) researchers cataloged those claims for this patent below. Several critical pieces of information emerge.

First, these patents to remotely control vehicles started being filed within two months of the passage of the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 (EEA) during Bill Clinton’s first term. The EEA was written by law professor James P. Chandler, III.

Robert Mueller, James Comey, Rod Rosenstein, Loretta Lynch, Eric Holder, Larry Summers were strategically positioned at the top of the Justice Department and Treasury. The patentee, Richard C. Walker, could have patented a ham sandwich had this group wanted it.

Second, the evident intent of the Walker patent was to illustrate the technology planned for control of everything—The Internet of Things.

THEIR JUSTIFICIATION: The benevolent control of vehicles and aircraft in hijack situations was merely the cover story for the development of a global surveillance grid on everyone and everything. Given the timing of these Walker filings (around 9/11), one is increasingly skeptical about who really caused 9/11.

Third, Robert S. Mueller’s law firm, Wilmer Hale LLP, formerly Hale & Dorr LLP, drove Walker’s filings. Mueller was sworn in as FBI director just seven days before 9/11. This clearly implicates Wilmer Hale in the treachery.

Fourth, the global data sharing platform described in the patent was not doable by the likes of IBM, Microsoft, Boeing, AT&T and Cisco. They were all behind the curve from an R&D perspective when the Internet emerged. For example, Bill Gates thought it was a fad. The telephone pager network that Walker described could not scale to the volumes required for such global communication.

James P. Chandler surely could not believe his luck, when, in early 2000, Michael McKibben of Leader Technologies was first introduced to him. Leader was looking for the best patent attorney in the country to protect its social networking innovations.

Chandler, on the other hand, needed a fix for the Deep State’s ailing digital takeover master plan. He agreed immediately to be Leader’s patent attorney. He then spent the next three years deceiving Leader until he was able to get his hands on the underlying engineering source code, which he immediately shuffled to the IBM Eclipse Foundation where DOJ’s Eric Holder and IBM’s David Kappos were waiting, along with Cisco, Microsoft, SAP, Oracle, Kleiner Perkins, Qualcomm, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, AT&T and a host of other rogue C.I.A. providers.

Leader’s source code was essential to building The Internet of Things, quickly.

The table below shows the patent filings included in the PFN/TRAC System FAA. The eventual patent focused on remote control of aircraft, but also subsumed control of vehicles, ships, equipment, commerce, education and people.

“Main Core is the code name of a database maintained since the 1980s by the federal government of the United States. Main Core contains personal and financial data of millions of U.S. citizens believed to be threats to national security. The data, which comes from the NSA, FBI, CIA, and other sources, is collected and stored without warrants or court orders. The database’s name derives from the fact that it contains “copies of the ‘main core’ or essence of each item of intelligence information on Americans produced by the FBI and the other agencies of the U.S. intelligence community.” Wikipedia

Are you on the target list? Are you one of the millions of Americans that have been deemed a threat by national security simply because of your opposition against the governments progressive/communist/Islamic agenda and your stand on the Constitution? Will you be targeted when martial law is imposed or worse killed? Will you join join the ranks of countless others who have stood against tyranny in this country and met their end in death?

Would you be surprised if I told you that their is a list of names that does exist created by the government to target those them deem in opposition? Those against the agenda they are attempting to push. In fact the government has multiple lists targeting citizens including: the main core list, terrorist watch list, no-fly list, to name a few and no one really knows how they get on the list or how to get off of it.

In the video below I delve through all this and more! I expose those who have already been targeted for speaking out and those who may be targeted in the near future. This is a very vital report and I strong urge you to watch it.

A superb way to see some of Europe’s finest scenery, experience the history and local culture onboard one of the many luxury hotel barges in the fleet

CRUISING THROUGH BURGUNDY



David Powell spent a week on the luxury hotel barge L’Impressionniste cruising through Burgundy. The Burgundy canal is one of the most attractive canals in France, winding its way through the heart of renowned vineyards, medieval towns, elegant chateaux, magnificent cathedrals, picturesque villages and wonderful local markets. Monday mornings don’t get much better than this. I’ve had a lovely breakfast, the sun is shining and our luxury barge is about to set sail. There are 48 locks to navigate during our week on L’Impressionniste and I’m looking forward to every one!

But firstly, what is luxury hotel barge cruising? Still a little known niche concept within the huge cruise industry, maybe the term barge or barging conjours up images of narrow boats or coal boats? In fact nothing could be further from the truth. Yes, most hotel barges started life as cargo vessels, L’Impressionniste for instance was built in Holland and carried cargo in the 1960’s, but they have since been painstakingly converted to offer luxury boutique accommodation for small groups of passengers, and all barges in the fleet benefit from an annual refurbishment of some description. This is cruising but probably not as you know it. The pace is slow with a 6-day cruise often covering less than 50 or 60 miles along a rural canal. Passengers can walk or bike along the towpaths and never get left behind as their floating hotel glides gently along. Cruising just a few feet from the towpath it’s easy to moor up and explore. The hotel barge experience includes comfortable accommodation in air-conditioned staterooms, fully inclusive with gourmet meals prepared by the onboard chef, fine wines and an open bar. Daily escorted excursions in private vehicles, bicycles, an on-deck spa pool and personal service from an experienced crew. Our Burgundy adventure starts at a centrally located hotel in Paris and it’s from here we are picked up at 2.30pm for our transfer to the barge by private chauffeured mini bus. Captain and tour guide Daniel and Matelot Sam introduce themselves to my wife and I, load our luggage into one of the two mini-buses and we’re off. A comfortable journey chatting to two of our fellow guests, a friendly professional couple from Sydney. Sam points out landmarks on the route and answers any last minute questions we have, although to be honest the pre-cruise information sent out by European Waterways was very comprehensive. We arrive in rural Burgundy and spot the elegant L’Impressionniste for the first time moored at Escommes. Forget the luggage that will soon be safely placed in our stateroom by the crew, we enjoy a lovely champagne reception to welcome us onboard and meet the rest of the crew, Chef Joss, Pilot James and our two lovely hostesses Erell and Carolyn. More champagne and snacks and a chance to get to know our remaining fellow guests, two couples from Canada and a couple from California although originally from the U.K., bringing the total guests onboard to just 10.We’re a friendly bunch, getting on really well and all looking forward to a week’s cruising, exploring Burgundy and tasting the wine! But now time to investigate our stateroom before dinner.

Staterooms & Suites Down a wide stairway of 12 steps from the lounge and here you will find the sleeping accommodation. There are 4 staterooms and two junior suites. This is a barge so space is at a premium but the staterooms, ours was called Sisley and located mid stern, are spacious with comfortable double beds, (some have single configurations) wardrobe and drawer space, bedroom tables and an en-suite wc and bathroom with shower. Staterooms are traditionally decorated to a high standard with port holes (ours had 3), air-conditioning and heating. Public Areas L’Impressionniste is certainly stylish, accommodating up to 12 guests. The lounge and open plan dining area are extremely comfortable with glorious panoramic windows, ideal to watch the world go by when cruising. The lounge is furnished with leather sofas and a coffee table and there’s a fully stocked bar built from oak with a drinks cabinet and fridge. The elegant dining table seats all guests at one sitting and the selection of prints, fabrics and wall coverings are reminiscent of the era after which our barge was named. Meanwhile, outside, there’s a large sun deck and a heated spa pool, which I can confirm is good fun having tried it several times with champagne in hand! There’s a large table for outside dining and plenty of seating. There’s no shortage of bicycles for every guest to use and we took advantage of them several times during the cruise disembarking at a lock, cycling along the towpath in the beautiful countryside to meet the barge a little further along. Yes we were cycling faster than the barge! Complimentary Wi-Fi is offered which worked well considering we were in a lot of rural locations, and as I mentioned earlier there’s two barge vehicles for transfers and excursions – a 9 seater Mercedes Sprinter and a 7 seater Mercedes Vito, so plenty of transportation space. A small library, board games and CD player were also available for use and Daniel would happily download from the internet a choice of music on request.

Continued below... Gourmet Dining Our onboard chef, Joss, worked tirelessly throughout the cruise preparing fabulous 3 course lunches and exquisite dinners. Before each meal he would pop out from the kitchen and in a relaxed and friendly manner outline the delicacies and regional specialties he had prepared. Dinner was always a gastronomic experience created by this very talented chef. Fine wines and a varied cheese board admirably served and described by Erell and Carolyn complemented each meal. Wonderful food, good company, fine outstanding wines, lots of cheese and Joss’ sensational culinary creations – the perfect combination! Cruising and Touring Back to my Monday morning. It’s our first full day and we set sail after breakfast from the canal summit at Escommes, 1250 feet above sea level and cruise to Vandenesse-en-Auxois. What a beautiful morning cruise, a great start! After lunch it’s time for our afternoon excursion to nearby Chateau de Bussy-Rabutin and here we see the portrait gallery created by the disgraced courtier of King Louis XIV and stroll around the gardens enjoying views of the chateau and its moat. Back to the barge where canapés and cocktails await our return. The following day I’m up bright and early for our cruise to Pont d’Ouche crossing the only canal bridge on the Burgundy canal. This is a perfect day for a walk along the towpath. After another splendid lunch we visit the medieval village, craft shops and castle of Chateauneuf-en-Auxois, once an outpost of the Duke of Burgundy.

Chateau de Beaune By day 4, Wednesday, after a short morning cruise, we’re deep into the Burgundy wine region and our excursion today is to the famous vineyard owned by the Domain Bouchard Pere et Fils. European Waterways arranged for a wine expert to accompany us, which was an interesting insight into the production of the domaine’s Grand Cru and Premier Cru wines. An exclusive wine tasting session and tour of the cellars at the Chateau de Beaune is followed by a gastronomic lunch in the orangery and a couple of hours to explore on our own the delightfully French town of Beaune. By Thursday we’re totally relaxed enjoying every moment of this barge cruise which today takes us to Gissey-sur-Ouche, again with plenty of opportunity to walk or cycle alongside. We cycle between two or three locks then head back onboard to relax on the sun deck with a glass of wine as we gently slide past sleepy villages and pretty lock houses. I make a mental note to ask Daniel how many locks we have now passed through but promptly forget as Carolyn’s busy topping up our glasses and bringing snacks. I estimate we’ve probably done about 20 or 30 locks and get back to watching the Burgundy world go by in the sunshine. After lunch we visit picturesque Clos de Vougeot, headquarters of the esteemed Chevaliers du Tastevin, who award a special prized label to the finest Cote d’Or vintages every year. On the way back to the barge there’s another private wine tasting, this time the fine Burgundy wines of Chateau Andre Ziltener, a family run winery built on the foundations of an old Cistercian abbey. There’s an opportunity to purchase many of the wines with shipping arranged to any destination in the world. That evening before dinner during one of his regular information updates Daniel announces we will be choosing our own lunch tomorrow in the produce market of Dijon. But for now its time for after dinner drinks and a soak in the spa pool. Friday and Joss joins us for the first part of our walking tour of Dijon. Here we visit the market and everyone gets a chance to choose what he or she would like to eat for lunch. Joss returns to the barge loaded up whilst we continue with some excellent shopping time including exploring the many mustard shops and the impressive Notre-Dame de Dijon. Returning to our barge and its time for our Dijon market extravaganza lunch – quiche lorraine, prawns, mussels, radish, green salad, pate, cheese selections, raspberry gateau and pear and caramel alongside a fine Saint Romain white wine and a red Fleurie.

Continued below... This afternoon we cruise to our final mooring at Fleurey-sur-Ouche and the splendid Captain’s farewell dinner onboard. Conclusion Barging through Burgundy was a fabulous experience and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it. My wife and I considered this to be one of our best holidays, we loved every minute! The highly professional crew on L’Impressionniste worked together as a team providing guests with a friendly service and experience that I would describe as outstanding. Nothing was too much trouble, guests were treated like royalty! European Waterways delivered a specialised and professional service from start to finish and we will remember this cruise for many years to come. A superb way to see some of Europe’s finest scenery, experience the history and local culture onboard one of the many luxury hotel barges in the fleet. European Waterways offer a lot of cruise itineraries covering France, Holland, Italy, the U.K., Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany.

9798,11058,Second woman accuses Rep. Ruben Kihuen of sexual misconduct,"A second woman has come forward accusing Rep. Ruben Kihuen of sexual misconduct.

The Nevada Democrat allegedly touched the woman’s legs or buttocks on three occasions without her consent and sent hundreds of text messages that were sexually suggestive, the Nevada Independent reported Wednesday.

According to the text messages, Kihuen asked her to sit on his lap during committee hearings and asked her on multiple occasions to spend the night with her. He also asked her in one text message the color of her “panties” and, when she refused to tell him, responded “Makes me sad” and “My day can’t go on without knowing.""

Kihuen also noted her personal appearance, making comments like: “You’re absolutely beautiful and unbelievable sexy” and “You looked so beautiful tonight ... irresistible.” He also once told her she looked “fabulous” in black, but said he was certain she looked “even better naked.”

Kihuen often used emojis in his texts to her, particularly kissy-faces with hearts, the heart-eye emoji, and red hearts.

The woman said she rejected or ignored the suggestions or proposals, and utilized several tactics including discounting the comment as a joke, ignoring him, or sometimes telling him “no.”

“I don’t think Ruben thinks what he did was wrong,” she told the Nevada Independent. “Like, I think he just thought he was playing around, which, I don’t think he realized the position he probably put people in.”

Kihuen did not confirm or deny these allegations when approached by the Nevada Independent.

“During my ten years in the Legislature, I dated several different women,” Kihuen said in a statement to the Nevada Independent. “Out of respect for their privacy, I won’t discuss my communications or any other details of those relationships.”

This is not the first time Kihuen has been accused of sexual misconduct. Earlier this month, BuzzFeed News reported Kihuen’s former finance director accused him of unwanted sexual advances, which were reported to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

In response to initial report, Rep. Ben Ray Lujan, D-N.M., called for Kihuen to resign. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., also called for his resignation shortly thereafter. Kihuen denied the charges.",http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/second-woman-accuses-rep-ruben-kihuen-of-sexual-misconduct/article/2643464,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
6118,6991,Covert Operation Requested by Anti-Gun Dems to Bust Illegal Internet Sales Comes up Empty,"Covert Operation Requested by Anti-Gun Dems to Bust Illegal Internet Sales Comes up Empty

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

An investigation requested by two fierce anti-gun members of Congress to determine if firearms are purchased illegally from internet dealers has come up empty. Maryland Congressman Elijah Cummings and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren demanded the probe in the aftermath of mass shootings and the investigative arm of Congress, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), conducted a lengthy covert operation to try to purchase firearms illegally from internet dealers.

All 72 of Congressional investigators’ attempts to purchase a firearm illegally via the surface web were unsuccessful, slamming Cummings’ and Warren’s claims that guns are easily obtained by criminal elements on the internet. “All of our attempts to purchase firearms from private sellers on the surface web were unsuccessful,” the GAO writes in an extensive report. “Our covert testing involving GAO agents attempting to purchase firearms illegally on the Surface Web were unsuccessful. Specifically, private sellers on Surface Web gun forums and in classified ads were unwilling to sell a firearm to our agents that self-identified as being prohibited from possessing a firearm.” Most of the sellers refused to complete a transaction once the undercover investigator revealed either a shipping address across state lines or a prohibition by law from owning firearms. Five of the vendors went so far as to freeze the undercover GAO accounts, preventing agents from using forums and attempting to make a purchase.

In their ardent push to ban guns Cummings and Warren, both high-profile Democrats, questioned whether the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) was enforcing gun laws involving transactions facilitated by the internet. The lawmakers asked the GAO to investigate whether online private dealers sell firearms to prohibited individuals. The probe was conducted from July 2015 to November 2017, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. It turns out that the ATF’s Internet Investigations Center, created to investigate buyers and sellers who use the internet to facilitate illegal firearms transactions, is indeed doing its job efficiently, according to the bipartisan GAO. “The Center uses several tools to provide investigative support to ATF, which has resulted in the arrests of individuals using the Internet to facilitate illegal firearm purchases,” the GAO report states.

Both Cummings and Warren have been vocal advocates for strict gun control measures in recent years. Last year Cummings joined House Democrats in a protest against congressional inaction on gun violence. “Every year, tens of thousands of Americans die as a result of gun violence,” the veteran congressman said during the heavily publicized sit-in. “In some states, firearms take more lives than car accidents. The American people are fed up with inaction and so am I. It is time for House Republicans to treat gun violence like the scourge on our country that it is.” The demonstration took place months after Cummings praised former President Barack Obama’s executive actions to prevent gun violence by expanding criminal background checks.

Warren has also been on a longtime war path against Americans’ rights to own firearms, proclaiming that “Rambo-style assault weapons” should be banned. The liberal icon co-sponsored a 2013 law to ban military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. She warned her colleagues during a speech on the Senate floor last year that Congress would have “blood on our hands” if assault weapons aren’t banned. After the Las Vegas shooting that killed dozens and injured hundreds, Warren took to social media to warn that “Tragedies like Las Vegas have happened too many times. We need to have the conversation about how to stop gun violence. We need it NOW.”

Look For Critical Counselors For Safety And Prosperity

‘Every purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice make war. Proverbs 20:18’

Good advice is necessary for good decision-making, and good advice is only gotten from good counselors. Solomon here taught you to submit your major plans to the scrutiny and criticism of wise counselors, who can save you from disappointment and trouble. This is true wisdom – to deliberate before you act, and to establish your plans by wise counsel.

Every way of a man is right in his own eyes, for your proud and deceitful heart convinces you that your plans are quite good and certain to succeed (Pr 16:2,25). You must use a multitude of counselors for safety (Pr 11:14).

It is a sin to be hasty in spirit, in speech, or in action (Pr 14:29; 29:20; 19:2). Haste is destructive, as it is said, haste makes waste (Pr 21:5; 25:8). Paul condemned a sinful trait he called being heady, which is to impetuously and recklessly rush ahead in some activity or choice (II Tim 3:4). Slow down to get counsel and good advice. If you are prone to be hasty and impulsive by temperament or training, you must doubly heed this warning.

But holding back in fear and worry is also foolish and will cost you, because you will miss the opportunities of gain and success that occur in every man’s life. Paralysis by analysis is a curse of melancholies, and wise counselors can give you a kick or push to get you moving on a profitable course. Objective counselors can be a great asset.

If you neglect seeking counsel, you are foolish, lazy, or proud. If you reject counsel you have been given, you are rebellious or stubborn. If you avoid counsel for fear of criticism, your heart is already foolishly infatuated with a risky proposition – you are emotionally attached to your plan. Beware! It is foolish to get your heart involved before your head.

The only perfect counselor is the Lord (Is 9:6). But He has not left you without other counselors. You have His perfect Word, which can make you wise (Ps 19:7-11; 119:98-100). You have His ministers, who can be perfect counselors by His Word (II Tim 3:16-17; Mal 2:7). You have parents, who usually have much greater wisdom and experience, and they also have strong motivation to save you from trouble (Ex 18:13-27). You have friends and brethren who are known for wisdom (Pr 20:25; 27:9-10; Acts 15:1-6).

What kind of counselors do you seek and use for your weighty decisions? Though older men are not always wise (Job 32:9), they generally are wiser (Job 12:12). A believer is better than a pagan, if there are moral considerations; they should have God’s wisdom in their heart and the highest degree of concern for your safety and prosperity. Look for critical counselors for sure, for the landscape is littered with the corpses of optimists.

Merely seeking counsel to fulfill this proverb is not enough, for you must also listen to the advice and follow it. Otherwise, the whole mechanism of safety and success is violated and overthrown. Rehoboam sought counsel, but he rejected the advice of the wise men who had counseled his father (I Kgs 12:1-19). And he lost the kingdom for it.

But matters like marriage are certainly worthy of counsel. The pain and consequences can be horrible; most people entering marriage have no experience at it, so they need the good advice of others (Pr 19:13). An uninvolved third party can save you much grief in this decision, and he or she can probably spot potential problems more easily than you.

Your choice to seek counsel takes time, so it requires discipline and patience, which will oppose your excitement and haste to get your neat idea moving forward. It also requires humility to ask others for their opinion, implying your need of their assistance. Such caution is prudent discretion, and such humility is wisdom. Do not let anything convince you that you cannot afford the time or that you can make decisions better yourself.

Young man, you need wise counsel more than most. Folly and vanity are bound in your heart; sober counsel can save you from trouble and pain. Older man, you are not above this lesson, for the hearts of all men are deceptively dangerous (Jer 17:9). It is pride, not principle, which keeps you from seeking counsel and letting others test your plans.

The ultimate counselor is the Holy Spirit, Who guides you by the Bible, not feelings. It is a lamp to your feet and a light to your path (Ps 119:105). If you submit your plans to the Lord, He will establish your thoughts (Pr 16:3; 3:5-6). If your heart is in fellowship with Him, you can move ahead with plans, submitting all to His will (Pr 16:9; Jas 4:13-15).

The more you learn the word of God, the more wisdom you will have (Ps 19:7-11; 119:98-100; Is 8:20). And this book of Proverbs is filled with the wisdom of the wisest man with the most experiences in life, and he wrote by the inspiration of God (Pr 1:1-9). The Lord Jesus Christ has all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, and the closer you are walking with Him, the more wisdom you will have yourself (Col 2:8).

7608,8653,Memorial Day 2015,"Subscribe to Canada Free Press for FREE

On Memorial Day we honor our sons and daughters who gave their lives when their nation called on them

Memorial Day 2015

We need to remind ourselves that Memorial Day is not just another three-day weekend or a day when all manner of sales are offered to those who want to go shopping. It is a day set aside to honor the ultimate sacrifice of those who have fought to defend our nation and take military action in foreign nations. We honor, too, those who suffered wounds and returned home.

We like to think of America as a nation that has gone to war only when we had to, but a new book, “America Invades: How We’ve Invaded or Been Invaded with Almost Every Country on Earth” tells a different story based on history. As documented by its authors, Christopher Kelly and Stuard Laycock, America, “has invaded or fought in eighty-four out of 194 countries (countries recognized by the United Nations and excluding the United States) in the world. That’s 43 percent of the total. And it hasn’t been militarily involved with just ninety or a hundred countries. It has had some form of military involvement with a spectacular 191 out of 194. That’s more than 98 percent.” “Most people,” the authors note “would probably agree that much of what America has done around the world has clearly been wise and noble (as in helping liberate Europe from Nazi tyranny.) Some, however, have been wrong and/or unwise. And some of what America has done has been in-between. In some sense, it’s like looking at the history of one’s own family. And, indeed, all of it—the liberations, the fiascos, and follies—is, in some sense, part of the history of every American citizen.” That’s why it is a good idea to pause on Memorial Day because as an American it is part of your history. “Americans are always hoping for peace but usually preparing for war” says the authors who remind us that “the American eagle is an ambivalent bird holding arrows in the talons of one foot and an olive branch in the other.”

Our natural instinct is for peace. Only aggressive nations, usually led by despots, want war. That is not a description of America. We have not, however, shied from war when the enemy was a well-defined aggressor. “In the twenty-first century, the United States, though challenged by Russia and China, is the sole remaining superpower. The global responsibilities that we began to shoulder in the twentieth century seem today more burdensome than ever. The cost of being the world’s policeman seems exorbitant in terms of both lives and treasure.” That’s why we need to remind ourselves that, as a former Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, has said of America, “We are the indispensable nation.” We have learned what happens when our President has retreated from the responsibility to deter war. Since leaving Iraq with no U.S. military ground support that nation which was stable at the end of our war there has come under attack by the Islamic State. The President’s efforts to reach a deal with Iran that would allow them to become a nuclear power is causing Arab states to regard the U.S. as abandoning them and could lead to a nuclear arms race in a part of the world that is far from stable. The U.S. in the wake of World War Two has a vast network of bases and alliances that span the world. Many of those bases were created at the invitation of the host nation. The result, as the authors note is that “The U.S. military, but virtue of its global reach, is almost invariably the first to respond to natural disasters as they occur around the world. If not us, then who will?” On Memorial Day we honor our sons and daughters who gave their lives when their nation called on them. “Today the sacrifice of over 218,000 American servicemen and servicewomen is memorialized in military cemeteries in twenty-four different overseas cemeteries in eleven different countries. The boundaries of Jefferson’s Empire of Liberty, therefore, stretch around the world.” We worry about the emergence of other world powers, but I doubt that Russia which lost 127 million of its people in World War Two or China which is focused on building an economy based heavily on world trade are serious wartime threats. That does not, however, exclude the likelihood that events may cause the next President to conclude that the only way to put the lid on the Middle East is to return militarily to Iraq and to make it clear to Iran that its nuclear ambitions are untenable and unacceptable. The ancient Romans knew a truth they share in the phrase, “Si vis pacem, para bellum.” If you want peace, plans for war. About the only thing that is predictable is that somewhere in the world there will be new wars and, given its power and its responsibility, America may well be engaged in restoring the peace. © Alan Caruba, 2015

9434,10652,Natural Cure For Depression Silenced?,"Source: www.wakeup-world.com | Original Post Date: August 20, 2014 –

Depression affects over 25 million Americans a year. But did you know there is a highly effective natural treatment? Inositol – or Vitamin B8.

Inositol Deficiency Linked to Depression

A 1995 study found amazing results treating depression with inositol. As reported in the American Journal of Psychiatry (Vol. 152, No. 5) “the overall improvement in scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale was significantly greater for inositol than for placebo at week 4. No changes were noted in hematology or in kidney or liver function… Inositol had a significant antidepressant effect in this study.”

A 2001 study continued to find impressive results, and “continuing reports of inositol’s efficacy in the treatment of depression, panic disorders, and OCD should stimulate replication studies”. Yet conventional medicine (in all its wisdom) continues to treat depression with pharmaceutical medications, despite the findings of a 2010 study that “the benefit of antidepressant medication compared with placebo may be minimal or nonexistent in patients with mild or moderate symptoms”.

My guess is, even if you suffer from depression, you haven’t heard about this study. And I’d even go further to guess that most of you have never heard of inositol.

Well if this is you, don’t feel bad. Far too many doctors are also unaware of this vital substance – and that is truly the travesty! The National Institute of Mental Health estimates that nearly 15 million American adults suffer from amajor depressive disorder, and sadly that number does not include or reflect undiagnosed mild depression or the depression that occurs in children. But each year, doctors are prescribing increasing amounts of anti-depressants, which translates to a multi-billion dollar profit (per year) for pharmaceutical companies.

Naturally, any of the numerous antidepressants prescribed today come with a lengthy side-effect sheet including the increased risk of suicidal thoughts, especially in younger patients. Other common side-effects include:

Dry mouth

Drowsiness

Dizziness

Sexual dysfunction

Blurred vision

Skin rash

Weight gain or loss

Insomnia or prolonged sleep

Irritation

Anxiety

Whew!

Antidepressants Causing More Harm

Where does a person turn when prescription drugs are causing more problems than they are “fixing”? Especially when medical doctors advocate against the use of nutritional solutions, let alone acknowledge that we live in a nutrition deficient country?

Sadly, the answer is that many people opt to finally try the natural route only to find that it didn’t work. This is often due to following reasons:

They didn’t take the nutrients long enough to experience a change.

They needed to take the nutrient in a higher dosage, but didn’t for fear of “toxicity”.

They became confused because of contradictions and misinformation regarding the natural method and simply gave up; now even more depressed than when they started!

All of the above listed reasons are unnecessary. Despite the extensive positive research on many natural treatments, our “healthcare” dictators insist on only recognizing drugs and profit, and patients have come to expect a quick fix instead of a lifestyle change. And the responsibility for this rests largely on the lap of the FDA and AMA.

Your Welfare is Not in the Best Interest of The FDA and AMA

It is interesting that the medical establishment boasts a nearly 95% safety rate regarding antidepressants. However this is a dangerously skewed percentage, giving the patient a false sense that the drug they are taking is actually safe.

Dr. Ann Blake Tracy, author of ‘Prozac: Panacea or Pandora?‘ said the following of the alarming correlation between antidepressant use, human behavior and health conditions:

“We have witnessed no decrease in suicide, but increases in murder/suicide, suicide, unwed pregnancies, domestic violence, manic-depression, MS, hypoglycemia, diabetes, bankruptcies, divorce, mothers (parents) killing children, road rage, school shootings, cancer, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, and fibromyalgia since these serotonergic drugs have become so popular and I relate it directly to the effects of these drugs.” ~ from the article, “The Aftermath of Prozac, Zoloft, Luvox, Fen-Phen, & Many Other Serotonergic Drugs

Overdose is also a problem, according to a 2013 press release from the United States Centers for Disease Control:

In 2010, nearly 60 percent of the drug overdose deaths (22,134) involved pharmaceutical drugs…. The researchers also found that drugs often prescribed for mental health conditions were involved in a significant number of pharmaceutical overdose deaths. Benzodiazepines (anti-anxiety drugs) were involved in nearly 30 percent (6,497) of these [pharmaceutical overdose] deaths; antidepressants in 18 percent (3,889), and antipsychotic drugs in 6 percent (1,351) ~

More Regarding So-Called “Safe” Antidepressants

Dr. Joseph Glenmullen, Clinical Instructor in Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, has treated patients with Prozac and discovered significant safety issues. He wrote “Personal Review: Prozac Backlash: Overcoming the Dangers of Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, and Other Antidepressants with Safe Effective Alternatives” to bring to light the true darkness of how drugs are approved by our “respected” FDA. An absolute must read!

Of course, any potential treatment depends upon FDA approval. And if a claim is made regarding a vitamin, mineral, or some other natural supplement without the FDA stamp of approval, you could be looking at a serious fine and/or jail time. However, even when the required research is done and the results prove positive, conveniently they often get buried or only partial results are allowed to surface; strategically placed negative studies appear; the cry from the skeptics and the pro-drug community is that the study did not have a significantly large enough trial group or that the long term effects are still unclear.

Well, the following shows the problem with “ethical and unbiased” research. Dr. Joseph Glenmullen found that congress had allowed itself to be manipulated by Big Pharma – and this is no big secret. Shockingly, drugs are routinely approved without long-term confirmation of safety! And short term studies (6-8 weeks) were often designed for only one purpose: market approval.

If a study is designed for specific outcomes, just how unbiased are the result? Do you think the results are skewed? You bet they are. And if you are one who trusts in the FDA stamp of approval, think again for the sake of your own health!

Think Again!

When studies find a natural substance is effective against depression, without the horrific side effects, and is something the body actually needs, why isn’t it given any attention?

If the FDA truly have our health at their forefront of their priorities, why then aren’t they putting their stamp of approval on inositol as fast as they do for drugs such as Prozac?

If a natural substance helps bring balance to our biochemistry, wouldn’t the next logical assumption be that we, as a nation, are possibility nutritionally deficient?

Doesn’t bringing the body back into balance sound more like the intelligent approach to health and wellness, rather than taking a chemical drug with serious side effects that does nothing more than mask the symptoms?

Where is the media, if they are truly unbiased?

And more importantly, why are we the public – or should I say the “FDA guinea pigs” – outraged and demanding the truth?

Do you ever feel like a bunch of cattle being herded one way or another? One politician drags you in one direction with certain enticements, while the mainstream media dangles a bit of alfalfa in front of your lips leading you in another. All the while it’s a part of their schemed plan to fatten you up and ship you to the slaughter house.

Well, this is exactly what the United Nations is doing to people all across the globe. Recently, two resolutions surfaced that promote a chilling likeness to the story of the cow. Resolution 69/202, an initiative that pushes the idea of a “global human order,” which sounds a lot like herding human cattle. And Resolution 69/292 an initiative that seizes control over our oceans.

In Resolution 69/202 they push the socialist agenda all while forcing the idea of a global human order and its compliance.

Here are just a few quotes from the resolution:

Their admitted goal:

“The role of the United Nations in promoting a new global human order”

“Noting the successes and challenges in recent years in promoting a new global human order at national and international levels,”

Their Socialist Agenda:

“Deeply concerned about persistent and considerable disparities between rich and poor, both within and among countries, and about the adverse implications of these disparities for the promotion of human well-being and development throughout the world,

Their data collection agenda:

“Recognizing the need to strengthen national capacities for robust data collection and effective data utilization in support of policy formulation, implementation and monitoring”

Their idea of secondary education and health care for all run by government organizations. (Nothing the government does turns out good, our colleges, our healthcare, would go to the crapper! This is STRAIGHT up socialism, which eventually leads to communism—government control of everything):

“Stresses the critical need for the expansion of and access to education and training, and encourages programmes to promote universal access to secondary education and to expand access to quality higher education, which is relevant to the needs of the labour market, in accordance with each country’s specific realities and development challenges”

“Invites Member States to adopt a multisectoral approach and to work on determinants of health within sectors including, as appropriate, through the healthin-all-policies approach, while taking into consideration the social, environmental and economic determinants of health, with a view to reducing health inequities and enabling sustainable development, and stresses the urgent need to act on social determinants for the final push towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals”

In Resolution 69/292 the United Nations launched an initiative to seize control over our oceans and according to a Fox News report, they want 2/3 of them. The report states:

“Development of an international legally binding instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction.”

Here’s more on this breaking report….

Questions and answers...now all that remains is...action

Questions and answers

Russian President Putin has revealed the true face of U.S. President Obama to the world.

He has shown the world that President Obama is feckless, cowardly, indecisive, undependable and delusional…that he does not have the intellect or the character to meet the demands of his office…that he does not have the intellect or the character to be the leader of the free world…that he has no substance and is an empty vessel. The world should certainly have known this before the debacle in Ukraine, but if it didn’t it definitely does now. Obama’s response to Putin’s attack on Ukraine and annexation of the Crimea raise a number of questions for Americans and for America’s friends and allies around the world. Here are a few for America’s friends and allies. Question: Is there anyone Obama will protect militarily…anyone that can depend on the American military to respond to an attack on them with force, overwhelming, immediate force?

Answer: No. Question: Does this mean that if the Iranians follow the Russians example and attack Israel that Obama will abandon the Israelis just like he did the Ukrainians? Answer: Yes. Question: Does this mean that if the North Koreans follow the Russians example and attack South Korea that Obama will abandon the South Koreans just like he did the Ukrainians? Answer: Yes. Question: Does this mean that if the Chinese follow the Russians example and invade and annex Taiwan that Obama will abandon the Taiwanese just like he abandoned the Ukrainians? Answer: Yes. Question: Does this mean that if the Russians choose not to stop with Ukraine and decide to attack other countries that they formerly controlled, that were formerly behind the Iron Curtain, in order to bring them back into their orbit that Obama will abandon them just like he abandoned the Ukrainians? Answer: Yes. Question: Does this mean that Obama just told the despots, demagogues, dictators and religious fanatics of the world that they are free to do whatever they want to because he will not intervene militarily no matter what and they therefore have nothing to fear from him, nothing to fear from the United States? Answer: Yes. Here are a few questions for Americans? Can you sleep soundly in your beds knowing that America’s enemies are much more likely to attack you and your country as a result of Obama’s demonstrated weakness and fecklessness…that he might not even respond with force, immediate, overwhelming force…that they now know for certain that they face no real deterrent? Answer: No. Question: What message does Obama’s response to Putin’s attack on Ukraine and annexation of the Crimea send to your enemies, send to those who would do you harm, great, great harm? Answer:Attack us too, attack us too. Question: Should Obama’s proposed budget cuts to the military, budget cuts that would cripple the military and totally compromise the safety and security of Americans and the national security of the United States, be allowed? Answer: No. Question: As things stand now what will Obama’s legacy be? Answer: Ruination and destruction, not only for America and Americans but for the Free World as well. Question: Are we in deep, deep trouble because we elected him? Answer: Yes. Question: Is there any possibility that he will change? Answer: None whatsoever. Question: Is there any possibility that things will get better with him in office? Answer: None whatsoever. Question: What are the chances of things getting worse as long as he remains in office? Answer: 100%. Question: What can we do to get rid of him? Answer: Rise up collectively and force his resignation or impeachment. Questions and answers…now all that remains is…action.

2232,2554,How A Root Canal Could Potentially Ruin Your Health,"While root canals are extremely common if you have never gotten one, you should definitely stick with never having one. And while your dentist may encourage it, after you read this you may change your mind.

There are more risks involved with root canals than we are often even made aware of and these risks are often underplayed. Dr. Mercola has posted on this subject many times and brought some great points to the table. One thing he mentioned was that you should not allow your dentist to mislead you, root canals are not your only option and they are not entirely safe.

You see, just like other organ systems in our bodies our teeth require a blood supply, venous drainage, nervous innervations, and lymphatic. Root canals are dead teeth. These dead teeth more often than not become sources of chronic bacterial toxicity in your body. Think of it this way, if you had a dead organ inside of your body you would remove it, right?

You would do this so that bacteria and necrosis did not set in and cause you to die in the long-run. So why are we not doing this with our teeth? Is it because you think it is any different because of the location? The whole idea, in general, is disgusting.

Teeth have roots, those roots contain many nerves within your body from the main canal to the side canals. Sure, when dentists perform root canals they remove the nerve from the main canal but they do not have means of accessing the side canals as they are microscopic. These have dead nerves left behind in those places.

Inside of these places bacteria that do not require oxygen to survive thrive. This causes toxicity because they digest necrotic tissue and cause chronic infection. Dr. Robert Kulacz actually ended up writing a book on this whole issue titled; The Toxic Tooth: How a Root Canal Could Be Making You Sick.

“I did a lot of root canals for many years,” “Everything was going smoothly until one day, a patient of mine said to me, ‘You know, I heard from my physician that root canals may be bad; that root canals may cause or contribute to other diseases in the body.’ and I said, ‘You’re crazy. Who is telling you this? That’s impossible.’ He said, ‘You got to look at this information.” He gave me websites of organizations like the International Academy of Oral Medicine and Toxicology (IAOMT) to look at. I went on to explore this topic so I could come back to him and say, ‘Here is where you’re wrong, here’s where your physician is wrong, and here is where the American Dental Association (ADA) is right.’ Lo and behold, I found out they’re right; I was wrong. I looked at Weston Price’s work, the work of Rosenow, and others. I decided to go to an IAOMT meeting… Dr. Boyd Haley’s lecture on root canals and how toxic they are changed my life. I realized I was wrong… From that day on, I changed my practice.”

While the ADA continues to say that these root canals are a safe procedure that cannot cause any diseases according to those who have actually spend time looking into the issue they are not correct. Kulacz says he has done biopsies on every root canal tooth he has ever extracted and almost all of them have remnants of necrotic debris still in the canal meaning that they were not thoroughly cleaned. Microbiological cultures of the surrounding bone showed infection almost one hundred percent of the time. Sure, many dentists believe they can sterilize a root canal but Kulacz’s biopsies prove otherwise.

Do your research before having any medical procedure done no matter how small or how big. You need to know what is happening to your body.

% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

The United States is officially blaming North Korea for the Wanna Cry cyberattacks which crippled internet infrastructure throughout the world earlier this year.

In other words, the U.S. is asking the world to ratchet up pressure on North Korea so that the Hermit Kingdom becomes more belligerent ahead of what looks like unavoidable U.S. military aggression.

In an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal, Trump administration homeland security adviser Thomas Bossert made no secret about the plan, writing:

The attack spread indiscriminately across the world in May. It encrypted and rendered useless hundreds of thousands of computers in hospitals, schools, businesses and homes. While victims received ransom demands, paying did not unlock their computers. It was cowardly, costly and careless. The attack was widespread and cost billions, and North Korea is directly responsible.

We do not make this allegation lightly. It is based on evidence. We are not alone with our findings, either. Other governments and private companies agree. The United Kingdom attributes the attack to North Korea, and Microsoft traced the attack to cyber affiliates of the North Korean government. The consequences and repercussions of WannaCry were beyond economic. The malicious software hit computers in the U.K.’s health-care sector particularly hard, compromising systems that perform critical work. These disruptions put lives at risk. The world is increasingly interconnected with new technologies, devices, networks and systems creating great convenience. Unfortunately, that provides bad actors opportunities to create mayhem with the hope of anonymity, relying on the complex world of ones and zeros to hide their hand. They have stolen intellectual property and done significant damage in every sector. North Korea has acted especially badly, largely unchecked, for more than a decade, and its malicious behavior is growing more egregious. WannaCry was indiscriminately reckless. The TL;DR is that U.S. officials are pretty much saying that North Korea declared war on the world with WannaCry.

5084,5738,Senate Hopeful Challenging Five-Term Incumbent Feinstein's Liberal Cred,"California Senate Leader Kevin de León (D) told Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) not to bother coming home for the holidays if she refused to take a pledge, as Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) had, to show support for the DREAM Act by blocking a year-end spending federal spending bill.

“Don’t come back to California if you haven’t demonstrated your leadership and your courage to stand up for these young men and women,” de León said during a December demonstration in favor of the DREAM Act.

“Dreamers make up hundreds of thousands of Sen. Feinstein’s constituents, and while talking a good game on Dreamers, when it comes to standing up and supporting them, she is AWOL,” de León added.

De León is on his way out of Sacramento thanks to term limits. He has his eye on Capitol Hill and wants Feinstein’s job. If recent polling is correct, de León stands a chance of winning it as the result of a left-wing assault on the Democratic Party’s Old Guard.

In an email announcing his campaign, de León said his primary bid was as much about resisting the Trump administration as it was showing a new way to the Democratic Party.

“We now stand at the front lines of a historic struggle for the very soul of America, against a president without one,” he said. “Every day, his administration wages war on our people and our progress. He disregards our voices. Demonizes our diversity. Attacks our civil rights, our clean air, our health access and our public safety.”

A December UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll showed Feinstein to be well ahead of de León, the first Latino to lead the California Senate. But only 41 percent of likely voters supported her, while 27 percent backed de León and 38 percent described themselves as undecided.

“Feinstein’s relatively modest lead is somewhat surprising given that the senator is nearly universally known by voters, while relatively few of those polled know enough about de León to offer an opinion,” said Mark DiCamillo, director of the Berkeley IGS poll.

Feinstein may have begun digging her own political grave when, in September, she refused to call for President Trump’s impeachment. Instead, she urged “patience” with the Trump administration.

De León told the Los Angeles Times that Feinstein’s comment didn’t reflect the “proper tone or tenor.”

“We don’t owe Trump patience,” de León said. “We owe Californians resistance.”

Sean Clegg, a Democratic Party operative in San Francisco, told the Times Feinstein’s “patience” comment was “Dianne being Dianne.” But Clegg said it showed that Feinstein is “greatly out of step with where Democrats are, and most Californian voters are.”

“The base is on fire like we really have not seen in more than a generation,” Clegg said.",https://pjmedia.com/election/senate-hopeful-challenging-five-term-incumbent-feinsteins-liberal-credentials/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

By Greg Hunter’s USAWatchdog.com

Top trends researcher Gerald Celente says he sees strong trends shaping up for 2018. First up, the embattled President Trump. Celente says, “There’s not been one shred of evidence, period, paragraph, that Russia had anything to do with tapping into or hacking the DNC information and going into their computers. It has nothing to do with Trump, but what it does is it’s taking the people’s minds off the major issues. It’s also building that military industrial complex even bigger. We’ve got to watch out for those Russians. Russia’s GDP is about 7% of America’s. Trump has increased our military budget $54 billion. The entire Russian military budget is $48 billion. You talk to the average person, and they hate the Russians. It’s working perfectly . . . We don’t see Trump being impeached.”

On the Clintons, Celente contends, “Going back to the Uranium One deal. Yes, it is going to fall back on the Clintons. The hundreds of millions of dollars given to the Clinton Foundation by Russians as they did the uranium deal. Those are facts. We don’t see anything happening to Trump.

On the economy, Celente says, “We are now going into almost a year going into the Trump rally. I was negative on the stock market until Trump got elected. What happened? We did a 180 (degree turn) a week after he got elected and said this rally is real. . . . Trump is pro-business . . . it’s good for the markets and that sector.”

But what about the 2018 economic forecast? Celente says, “For the economy, we see a slowdown. Interest rates are going up. That’s the bet. Interest rates are going to go up another 25 basis points in December. So, we believe by the 2nd quarter of 2018, you are going to start to see a slowdown because the only thing that has pumped up the markets is the cheap money. . . .The fish rots from the head down, the markets are going to melt from the head down. The head being the very rich. The top 10% of the rich own 96% of the stock. . . . So, this thing rots down, and we are seeing it now on research. It’s going to fall from the top.”

Celente also predicts China will make big headlines in 2018. Celente points out, “China is not using petro-dollars. They are buying Russian oil, their biggest supplier, with yuan. You can cash in the yuan for gold. It’s the same with Iran and with Saudi Arabia. This is another reason that China is going to go further. You can start bringing your dollars to Walmart in a wheelbarrow because that’s what they will be worth. . . . What kept the dollar alive as the world reserve currency is that all the oil being traded is being bought in dollars. If you are paying for oil in other currencies . . . the Federal Reserve can’t keep printing up all the money that they want. They won’t have it out there as a reserve currency. You will see inflation skyrocket in this country, and gold will hit like a Bitcoin high. We believe it’s starting to happen.

After the Interview:

Gerald Celente also says the NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) will be renegotiated by President Trump, and he does not need Congressional approval. Celente predicts, “The renegotiation of NAFTA will be a big positive for Republicans and a big selling point for them in the 2018 Mid-term Elections. Right now, NAFTA only helps multinational companies. When it’s renegotiated, it will help American citizens.

9918,11185,Hurricane Sandy and Government Machinations: One Year Later,"What a year it has been since Hurricane Sandy. Nearly three months after Superstorm Sandy hit the US on October 29, 2012, the Sandy Relief bill was passed. It almost didn’t make it in Congress at all, having been caught up in the “Fiscal Cliff” crisis.

But when Congress finally gets hands on Sandy Relief, a bill with good intentions, they created a half-pork barrel spending/half-relief spending measure. Once the Mulvaney amendment failed, a $17 billion Hurricane Sandy relief bill with a 1.63 percent cut to discretionary programs, the final version of Sandy Relief metastasized into the monstrosity passed. It was spending spree bill that was not offset by equal and opposite cuts. It fully added $50.5 Billion dollars to the deficit — three weeks after the tax hike on the rich for the purpose of deficit reduction.

No one denied that those citizens who were affected by the catastrophic and legendary storm deserved help. However, the bill perfectly encapsulated the dysfunction of our Congress. Only three weeks after the fiscal cliff deal that raised taxes on the highest income earners, Congress managed to figure out how to fritter away a year’s worth of that revenue that was raised (after many months of wrangling and negotiations). By raising the tax rates on the wealthiest citizens, which was a longtime objective of Obama’s, here was finally something tangible to soak the rich so the the rich could “pay their fair share” This, we were told, was absolutely necessary to raise revenue because of our deficit. The tax increase was to provide the government with $600 Billion in revenue over ten years (roughly $60 billion each year).

The stinging part of the Sandy Relief Bill was that it wasn’t all hurricane relief. Also included were items such as $10 million for FBI salaries, $2 billion for road construction across the country, as well as funding for the Head Start program and roof repairs at the Smithsonian. Such items did not belong in the Sandy Relief Bill. Only about a third was actually for relief: $17 billion was for aid, while another $33 billion was for “other”

This has nothing to do with whether the non-Sandy provisions of the bill were worthwhile or not. But there is no reason why those extra provisions shouldn’t be dealt with on the same playing field as all the other potentially important uses of our federal tax dollars. Why did these particular spending measure bypass the intense oversight and scrutiny that every expenditure in the budget requires of our legislators so that we don’t overspend our revenue? Herein lies a neverending problem.

At the end of the day, the tax hike on the rich was almost entirely wiped out by the Sandy Bill. By voting up the $50.5 Billion in “aid” that was crafted, (and if you combine that amount with the $9 billion for the National Flood Insurance Program also approved in January 2013), Congress spent the entire sum of a year’s worth of revenue from the rich’s “fair share” — with most of it going to fund more government instead of reducing the deficit — in one fell swoop.

Here we are a year later. The AP reported this week citizens impacted by Sandy have had a lot of waiting to do with very little to show for it in New York City. “Because the federal government has only released the first tranche — about $700 million — of the roughly $60 billion package of storm recovery aid approved by Congress, city officials say they still don’t know how much money they’ll be able to distribute to storm victims”.

And more: “About 24,000 families have signed up for the city’s Build-It-Back program, which will help pay for repairs, elevate their homes and reimburse them for repairs that have already completed, among other things. But many still haven’t received any money nearly a year after the storm“.

How can this be? How is it that Congress has only released $700 million so far? The $17 billion “aid” part of the Sandy Relief bill included the following:

$5.4 billion for FEMA to provide immediate relief to families and pay for temporary housing, debris removal and crisis counseling.

$5.4 billion went to major transportation agencies in New York and New Jersey

$3.9 billion to repair damages to publicly owned hospitals, roads and utilities

$1.35 billion to the Army Corps of Engineers

$287 million for national parks

$235 million for veteran facilities

$32 million for Amtrak

$6 million to replenish and stock food banks and soup kitchens.

It is gross incompetence that supposedly only $700 million of a $50 billion aid package — 1.2% — has been released by Congress. Where are the funds? And what about the non-aid parts of the bill? The $33 billion in pork? Have those funds been distributed?

Equally disturbing is the revelation this week that the very company responsible for the disastrous ObamaCare website (CGI Federal Inc.) also received funds to distribute for Sandy Relief. According to the Daily Caller, CGI “assisting the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in the distribution of $1.7 billion in relief for Hurricane Sandy”. This was verified by a memo obtained by Freedom Works. Notes of the minutes of the memo record that

Mr. Nelson presented that the State received a $1.7 billion allocation in CDBG Disaster Recovery aid from HUD to aid impacted businesses and residences. He stated that the State’s Action Plan was approved on April 26, 2013 and HTFC is currently in a phase of implementing the program. He stated that in this phase, the corporation needs to stand-up its recovery programs as soon as possible to deliver critical resources, and in order to do so, the corporation requires immediate access to consultant services to assist in policy and procedure development, training, surge capacity, and call center assistance, and stated that CGI Federal Inc. could provide such services. Mr. Nelson stated that the corporation entered into a short term contract with CGI, Federal Inc. on a discretionary basis of $49,000 to start with these critical disaster recovery efforts, and he requested that the Board approve a contract with CGI Federal Inc., procured on an emergency basis as justified under Executive Order 63, for an amount up to $4,280,000 for a term through March 31, 2016.

The company that charged the federal government more than $600 million to build a website that has failed miserably is the very same company that received a contract for another $4 + million through 2016 to help distribute Sandy aid, a task at which it has also failed miserably.

One year after Superstorm Sandy, we can clearly see the failings of Congress in its fiduciary responsibility.

It approved tax hikes on the wealthy under the guise of deficit reduction — $60B a year for 10 years

It approved as a relief bill nearly the same amount that was to be raised by the tax hikes — a bill that was 2/3 pork and only 1/3 relief.

It has only released 1.2% ($700 million) of the $50 billion in aid

It contracted enormous sums of federal tax dollars with CGI, a company that is being paid 1) to assist with distributing nearly $2 billion in aid and 2) is the chief architect behind the ObamaCare website abomination

And yet, just a few days ago, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid gave a radio interview in which he spelled out the next phase of budget negotiation, where he once again calls for more taxes:

“The only people who feel there shouldn’t be more coming in to the federal government from the rich people are the Republicans in the Congress. “Everybody else, including the rich people, are willing to pay more. They want to pay more.”

He also went on to announce that the only way there could be some sort of Congressional “grand bargain” would be under the conditions that the Republicans would have to agree to more tax revenue:

“They have their mind set on doing nothing, nothing more on revenue, and until they get off that kick, there’s not going to be a grand bargain on — there’s not going to be a small bargain,” Reid said. “We’re just going to have to do something to work our way through sequestration.”

William Pitt the Younger sagely observed that “Necessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom. It is the argument of tyrants; it is the creed of slaves.” We constantly hear how the government needs more money. After a year of particularly gross fiscal mismanagement in Congress — from Hurricane Sandy to the Fiscal Cliff to Sequestration to the government shutdown to Healthcare.gov, the Democrats still have the gall to sound the call for more taxes. The trillion dollar question then becomes: What Will Republicans Do?",http://canadafreepress.com/article/hurricane-sandy-and-government-machinations-one-year-later,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

Officially, it’s Butler Creek’s ASAP AR-15 and M16 magazine loader. (Photo: Team HB)

I’ll confess that I thought the concept of an AR magazine loader was a bit silly. After all, isn’t an AR mag already easy to load? Skeptical, I agreed to test the ASAP mag loader by Butler Creek. Some of my skepticism was erased as a result.

This mag loader does present itself well. Butler Creek packaged it in a hanging plastic display case, worthy of gift-giving. If first impressions mean something, this one’s in good taste.

The loader is about 1/3 the length and slightly bigger around than a 30-round magazine, with a folding lever on one side. To use it, the body of the loader slides around a mag. A tab on the outside secures it with an audible “click.” The lever is lowered to lock it in place, but it’ll work with the lever unlocked as well. Rounds are inserted horizontally, one at a time. After each round is in the loader, the user can either push down on the top, which pushes the round into the magazine, or work the lever up and down for the same effect.

Faster than hand-loading? Not for most of us, but it does turn a fine motor activity into a gross motor one. For some people, that can make the difference between enjoying a long shooting session and having to cut it short because of pain.

Trying it myself, I didn’t see much difference between using the loader and not. However, I thought of Nancy (not her real name), a friend who lives out of state. Never mind that she’s past 60 years of age; Nancy is more determined than most younger folks about logging practice hours with her Glock 19. But even for someone like her, for whom self-protection is a practiced skill, an ambush is a tough situation in which to prevail. That’s exactly what happened last year, when she was viciously attacked by a career criminal while at work. She survived, albeit with a severely damaged shoulder.

It’s been almost a year since that crime, intrepid Nancy purchased her first AR-15 this spring. She is gingerly , and unbeknownst to her surgeon, dipping her toe into the waters of defensive and recreational rifle shooting . We recently met up for a training session. She didn’t complain, but it was obvious that stuffing mags was the source of a twinge of pain with every round, especially when a mag was more than half full . I introduced her to the ASAP loader, showed her how to use it, and left to do my own range work for a while. Her instructions were to use the loader however it worked best, and to give honest feedback on whether it was helpful .

Nancy looked up from her chair, smiling, when I returned. “Heyyyy, this helps,” she said, raising the loader in the air like a trophy. “It was just so-so using it on the table, but I found if I use it on my leg, it’s really easy. No pain.”

The “on my leg” method was then demonstrated. Sitting in a folding chair, Nancy set the mag upright on her right thigh, pushed the ASAP loader over it, with the insertion side facing her left . With a bag of ammo resting on the table, she was able to painlessly fill the magazine. It left her with plenty of energy for shooting.

I am pleased to recommend that anyone with torso or upper-limb problems give the Beaver Creek ASAP AR magazine loader a try . I recommend this thanks to my friend’s determination to keep developing as a shooter after a disabling injury, along with a willingness to try new things . This device might make shooting easier and more fun for anyone who has had carpal tunnel surgery or other arm/hand injuries . If you’re one of them, or have a loved one who is, this might be a perfect problem-solver.

AT&T just won a $2 billion contract with the National Security Agency, but nobody’s sure of what they’re going to do.

Libertarians and leftists have been outraged and in hysterics about the NSA for years. Further, traitors like Bradley Manning and Edward Snowden have joined an ongoing Russian-funded Wikileaks campaign to degrade American signals intelligence (listening in on the enemy). So naturally when NSA starts throwing around billions of dollars for its “Groundbreaker” program, people want to know why.

NSA says that these contracts are being awarded to renovate and modernize “non-mission” systems. That is, according to this official story, AT&T is being asked to work on computers, phones, and Internet access that are used for the business of running the NSA, not for the businesses of listening in to the enemy (or the ever-present boogeyman of “domestic surveillance“).

They could be lying. AT&T could be getting hired to try to listen in to the domestic Internet and phones in America. NSA won’t tell us specifics, because they don’t want to tell anyone specifics of how their internal systems operate.

Do you believe them?

7930,9001,The United Kingdom’s Health Care Mess and Its Implications for a Clinton Presidency,"Subscribe to Canada Free Press for FREE

The Democrats first rejected HillaryCare, but then gave Americans ObamaCare

The United Kingdom’s Health Care Mess and Its Implications for a Clinton Presidency

Hillary Clinton was clearly disappointed when the health care legislation proposed by the task force she headed was declared dead on arrival when it was submitted to a Democrat controlled Congress on November 30, 1993. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan’s comment that anyone who thought her health care plans would work wasn’t living in the real world served as a fitting epitaph.

As Mrs. Clinton prepares to run for president, she knows that ObamaCare will be a major campaign issue. The unpopularity of President Obama’s signature piece of legislation was the primary reason for the shellacking the Democrats took in the 2014 Congressional election. During the campaign Mrs. Clinton will distance herself from ObamaCare by noting that she was not involved in its passage and acknowledging that modifications to the legislation are required. After winning the presidency and if in doing so she enables the Democrats to regain control of both houses of Congress, she is likely to try to replace ObamaCare. However, ObamaCare and her previously proposed health care legislation are so similar that HillaryCare is likely to be even more unpopular and unaffordable than ObamaCare. President Hillary Clinton and Congressional Democrats fearful of the political fallout from a repeal of ObamaCare will have no choice but to double down by replacing ObamaCare with a single payer system modeled on the United Kingdom’s National Health Service. Since this was what First Lady Clinton, President Obama and the leaders of the Democrats in Congress all wanted in the first place, a look at the current state of health care in Britain gives us a vision of what may be in store for the United States if Hillary Clinton becomes the next president.

London has only a single air ambulance helicopter to serve the roughly 10 million people who live in the city and its nearby suburbs. When the helicopter is in use or out of service, Londoners have to hope that their stroke, heart attack or other emergency requiring immediate medical attention does not occur during rush hours. Of course getting to a London hospital quickly was of little value to the 4,400 patients who in December 2014 lay in the ambulance outside the emergency room door for between 30 minutes to an hour before they were transferred to the emergency room. Once inside the emergency room, they waited again, often for more than four hours. Twelve London hospitals declared “major incidents,” that is, they admitted that they were failing to meet the four hour standard for being seen by an emergency room doctor, and at some hospitals average waits of six hours or longer were commonplace. In addition to declining standards of care, especially emergency room care, but more generally medical care across the board, the NHS faces significant financial shortfalls. In an effort to control expenses, the NHS has taken a number of steps to restrict health care such as recently canceling 25 cancer treatments. In an interview with the Financial Times NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens expressed concern that unless the government provided sufficient funding there would be a “public backlash” against the NHS. In a January 2015 Ipsos MORI poll, adults across Great Britain were asked to name the issues that would be most important to them in helping to decide whom to vote for in the upcoming general election. The NHS was the number one issue by a 13 point margin. The Labour Party created the United Kingdom’s National Health Service in 1948 and they are now hoping that by making health care their primary campaign issue, the widespread dissatisfaction with the NHS will enable them to win the majority of seats in the House of Commons in the upcoming May 7 general election. It will be interesting to see if Britons unhappy with the NHS will restore to power the party that created the mess to begin with. The Democrats first rejected HillaryCare, but then gave Americans ObamaCare. As President, would Mrs. Clinton take the position that the only way to fix ObamaCare was to create a US National Health Service?

Congressman Allen West (U.S. Army Ret.) (Fl. 22) has lived his life in service to America. In 2004, when it was time to retire from more than twenty years of service in the US Army. He then returned to Afghanistan as an advisor to the Afghan army, an assignment he finished in November 2007.

There is so much which has occurred since my last missive. Of course we breached the Obama 100 day milestone and all I can say is….Holy Cow Batman!

However, as I sit here pondering my focus for this month I am reminded of a bit of history from ancient Rome. Back after the defeat of the great Carthaginian General Hannibal, Roman parents would use a simple threat when disciplining their wayward children, “Hannibal is at the gates”. There are many issues facing the Obama administration, and I am sick of his “I inherited this” excuse. He should not have run for President if he finds that he is too inept to display visionary leadership.

By MICHAEL W. CHAPMAN / FAMILY SECURITY MATTERS

In reference to remarks mde by President Donald Trump at the lighting of the national Christmas tree, Rev. Franklin Graham said no president in his lifetime had taken such a “strong, outspoken stand for the Christian faith” than President Trump and that he needs our prayers.

In a Dec. 1 post on Facebook, the day the tree was lit, Rev. Graham said, “Never in my lifetime have we had a president willing to take a strong, outspoken stand for the Christian faith like President Donald J. Trump has.”

“Whether you are Protestant, evangelical, Orthodox, Catholic — all Christians need to get behind him with our prayers,” said Graham.

At the lighting event on Dec. 1, President Trump, in part said, ”For Christians this is a holy season, the celebration of the birth of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. The Christmas story begins 2,000 years ago with a mother, a father, their baby son, and the most extraordinary gift of all – the gift of God’s love for all of humanity.

“Whatever our beliefs we know that the birth of Jesus Christ and the story of this incredible life forever changed the course of human history. There’s hardly an aspect of our lives today that His life has not touched – art, music, culture, law and our respect for the sacred dignity of every person, everywhere in the world.

“… At Christmas we are reminded more than ever that the family is the bedrock of American life.

“And so this Christmas we ask for God’s blessings for our family, for our nation. And we pray that our country will be a place where every child knows a home filled with love, a community rich with hope, and a nation blessed with faith.”

In Part 1 we revived Senator Howard Baker’s famous description of the giant Reagan Tax Cut of 1981 as a “riverboat gamble”, and that it was. When the “bidding war” with the Dems ended in July 1981, the US Congress had cut the Federal revenue base by 6.2% of GDP in the outyears. At today’s economic scale that would amount to a tax cut of $1.2 trillion per year!

***

By contrast, the peak year cut (FY 2019) in the current tax bill is just $280 billion. Nevertheless, we present this chart to demonstrate why today’s GOP “riverboat gamble” is actually far more dangerous than the one back then, and also why it’s capacity to actually stimulate a growth surge in the US economy is not even a pale imitation of the 1981 act.

2563,2929,Trudeau’s Summer Jobs Ideology Test Will Damage Students and Children,"

The Canada Summer Jobs program provides over $200 million per year to fund some 70,000 students with seasonal employment. Just before Christmas, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau changed the requirements for funding which now demands that applicants and employers sign a document to attest that they support “women’s reproductive rights, and the rights of gender-diverse and transgender Canadians.”

Dr. Charles McVety, President of Canada Christian College and School of Graduate Theological Studies and the Evangelical Association, says “I am very concerned about the children who will be hurt by Trudeau’s ideological test as their favourite camp worker will be rejected for not swearing to support abortion. It is sad to think of the thousands of Christian students will lose their summer jobs for not attesting to multiple genders, jobs they depend upon to pay for fall tuition. All so the Prime Minister can flex his muscles to force young people to bow to his decrees.”

McVety goes on to say “Christian leaders from across the country representing several million Canadians are asking Prime Minister Trudeau to withdraw his attack on Christians and come to the table to discuss how to best support students with freedom and equality while recognizing that bible believing Christians will be able to swear support abortion or multiple genders. This Christians Need Not Apply approach will not be tolerated under section 15 of the Charter or by the court of public opinion”.",http://canadafreepress.com/article/trudeaus-summer-jobs-ideology-test-will-damage-students-and-children,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

ARE YOU COMPLETELY PREPARED & PROTECTED?

The Bible tells us that every human has sinned and fallen short of the glory of God which is is a heart-penetrating truth. He has provided a way to cleanse us of our sins since we can never be “good enough” to cleanse ourselves. That avenue to God’s grace, mercy and forgiveness (the cleansing of our sins) is through His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ of Nazareth Who is equally God.

Not one of us are guaranteed a “tomorrow”. Has your time run out? Will you continue to ignore the promptings of God the Holy Spirit or have you awakened to the essential need for God, risking eternal damnation?

​​God the Holy Father, God the Holy Son and God the Holy Spirit are One God, the true, living, uncreated God Who is ever-present, all knowing, all powerful and all loving. He desires that every single person be forgiven, saved and to live eternally with Him. He is our only real protection and His love for you is unchanging. Accept Jesus Christ as your Savior, the true Messiah, today.

You can’t take your salvation for a test drive. You’re all-in or not.

Admit to Him that you are a sinner in need of forgiveness, that you are truly sorry for your sins. Acknowledge that He died for your sins, rose from the dead and lives forevermore. Invite Him into your life and to help you to turn from sin. Rejoice! You just became a Christian! Now trust in Him and get to know Him through the Bible which tells us everything we need to know and through prayer/talking to Him. He eagerly desires relationship with you.

8566,9694,Giant “Shithole” Projected Onto Trump’s D.C. Hotel,"Giant “Shithole” Projected Onto Trump’s D.C. Hotel

% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

The word “shithole” graced the front of President Trump’s D.C. hotel Saturday evening, along with flying “poo” emojis in a multimedia display.

The video projection also included the “Pay Trump bribes here” “emoluments welcome,” and “we are all responsible to stand up and end white supremacy”

Watch here:

On Thursday evening, reports broke that Trump had criticized the Gang of Six senators’ plan to reinstate TPS programs for El Salvador, Haiti, and some African nations.

“Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?” Trump reportedly in the White House meeting with a group of senators, including Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. According to the Washington Post, Trump then suggested that the United States should instead bring more people from countries such as Norway, whose prime minister he met with Wednesday. The president, according to a White House official, also suggested he would be open to more immigrants from Asian countries because he felt that they help the United States economically.

Meanwhile, the comment sparked outrage among Democrats who did not hesitate to publicly slam Trump for what many said was a racist comment.

President Trump denied the comment on Friday, tweeting “this was not the language used” during the DACA meeting.

The language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough, but this was not the language used. What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made – a big setback for DACA! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 12, 2018

He then following up by claiming he “never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country. Never said “take them out.” Made up by Dems. I have a wonderful relationship with Haitians. Probably should record future meetings – unfortunately, no trust!”

I have a wonderful relationship with Haitians. Probably should record future meetings – unfortunately, no trust! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 12, 2018

Despite Trump’s vehement denial, it wasn’t enough to keep enraged activists from pulling off a vulgar, poo-themed protest of the President.

9323,10530,Health Care Reform in the Real World,"The unconstitutional process taking place in Washington DC has most Americans feeling like they are living in the Twilight Zone. Since when is wiping out private health care a method of “reforming” private health care, and on what basis is Obama “gaining supporters” for his plan when the bill hasn’t even been written or reported on by the CBO yet?

There is NO honest open debate happening on a piece of legislation that nobody has seen yet. But that hasn’t stopped Obama & Co. from twisting arms to gain support for a bill that doesn’t exist, despite the fact that most Americans violently oppose any effort by the Fed to seize control of one-sixth of the US economy, via health care.

So let’s take a real world look at the health care discussion, on the level of the average citizen supporter of nationalized health care.

Believe it or not, I actually have a few regular readers from the other side of the aisle. I assume, because I get their heart rate and blood pressure up and eliminate their need for a cardiovascular workout.

But one of my oldest friends from across the aisle is Nick, and Nick wrote me concerning my last column - The Truth About Progressives - aka Marxists.

“Quick question - My buddy Jeremy got laid off from FedEx in Sept. after 13 years with the company. Without many employment options out there for him, he decided to return to college. That was probably a good idea. However, that leaves him without health insurance. He can’t afford it. What’s your advice to him, Dr. Williams?”

As always, I tried to provide my best advice…

“Don’t replace an incoming producing job with non-income producing expense and hope to balance your personal budget. He has to replace income with income, not income with expense. I hope he signed up for Accounting 101…”

Nick didn’t appreciate my advice…

“I appreciate your candor. I’ve been waiting for a conservative/Republican to state their true belief about health insurance, which is: “If you don’t have it, tough sh*t!” Your honesty is refreshing. I’m sure Jesus would be proud.”

I asked Nick to answer a few questions…

Name the Fed programs that ran on budget as projected and didn’t go bankrupt? Who came up with the HMO and what did the HMO do to health care? What do you think the Fed runs well? Why do people from countries with socialized medicine come to the USA for treatment, even when they can’t afford it? Since the bill isn’t even written yet, and the CBO hasn’t analyzed it yet, on what basis is Obama “gaining support” for his plan?

Nick is still thinking…

Then I decided to offer Nick what he wanted…

“I agree to pay for your friend’s health care needs while in college. But as the payer, I get to define what his health “needs” are, and what treatments are economically acceptable to me. Still want me to be his health care provider?”

There is one rule that you can never escape on earth.

He with the gold makes the rules…

If the gold is in the hands of the people, as it has been for more than 235 years in the United States, then it is the people who make the rules. Nick’s friend Jeremy is free to make his own choices, whether to work or go to school, have coverage or not have coverage, choose what types of coverage to have, all at his own discretion.

But if the people allow their government to control the gold, then it is that government who gets to make all the rules, who is covered and who isn’t, what is covered and what isn’t, which treatments are economically acceptable to the universal payer, and which treatments aren’t.

In short, this is why people from all parts of the globe come to the United States for medical treatment, even though they have “universal care” in their home country, and often can’t really afford the treatment they need in the United States.

Americans can tell where foreigners are from by the condition of their teeth, their skin, their hair or other health related physical traits. We can tell which visitors come from countries with “free” health care. What does that tell you about “free” health care?

It is a matter of life and death

A supporter of universal health once asked me what heart bypass surgery is really worth – indicating that the USA price for such a procedure is too high… He was from Canada.

I answered - that depends on whether or not I am having a heart attack at the moment you ask. If I’m not having a heart attack, the bypass surgery is too expensive. But if I am having a heart attack, who cares how much the surgery costs or what I have to do to pay for it?

The point should be very clear now… do YOU want to decide whether or not you get that surgery, or do you want your government to decide? He with the gold makes the rules.

This is the health care debate in the real world. Are there things we could do to improve the quality and affordability of health care in America? – Of course, and we should do those things. But name one federal program that the Fed has run well?

Freddie and Fannie?

Social Security?

Medicare?

Medicaid?

Food Stamps?

Welfare?

Every program has been plundered, wasted and bankrupted by the very folks telling us they can run one-sixth of the US economy and make your health care decisions for you…

As average citizens, we can buy a hammer for less than a tenth of what the federal government pays for a hammer on average. That’s because nobody is more careful with your money than you are…

So when the government says that they can manage YOUR money and your health better than you can, on what basis do you believe them? There is NO track record to support such a silly notion.

So, on what basis is there any support for nationalized health care?

Do you think Nick still wants me to be his friend’s health care provider?

And the forests will echo with laughter.

There’s still time to change the road you’re on.

And it makes me wonder.

Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know

Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?

And as we wind on down the road

Our shadows taller than our soul.

There walks a lady we all know

Who shines white light and wants to show

How everything still turns to gold.

And if you listen very hard

The tune will come to you at last.

Green roofs might be designed around utilizing rainwater, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t just as susceptible to leaking as traditional roofs. Use the first few weeks of the season to schedule an inspection by a roofing company to look for small nooks, cracks, and other openings in the roof’s basic structure. Likewise, investigate your attic for any telltale signs of water damage, like mold or dripping, as this is a clear indication of damage to the waterproofing layer beneath the vegetation.

The Importance of Snow Removal

Like a normal roof, your green roof will inevitably accumulate snow during the winter months. This can prove devastating for the vegetation if it isn’t removed promptly; however, some snow should be left to insulate the fauna. The general wisdom is to leave a layer about four inches deep. Anything beyond this should be removed, as excess pileup can disturb the plant life, if not ruin it permanently.

Pruning Vegetation

Deciduous or evergreen foliage on your green roof will keep it looking vibrant and healthy even through the winter months, but it also means you’ll need to care for your plants during this season. Trimming and pruning should be carried out every three years to encourage new leaf growth. Make sure to handle any necessary de-weeding before the soil begins to harden, as this will save you trouble down the line once temperatures start to heat up again. In the lead-up to winter, weeding should be carried out every three to four weeks.

Routine Maintenance

The beauty of green roofs is that, by and large, they require little maintenance after the first few months to years of growth. That said, if you live in a region with impactful winters, it’s worth taking precautions, just as you would with a standard roof. Address these problems as early in the season as possible to ensure your roof is back to its vibrant self once the growing season returns.

Gutter and Drain Maintenance

Weather will inevitable knock plant debris and soil into your gutter. While this will naturally lead to clogs, it can also give a space for invasive plants and weeds to take root and threaten the health of your green roof. Work with a roofing company. They should address this problem when examining your roof for other latent structural problems, since both factors will inevitably contribute to leaking once snow settles onto the roof’s exterior.

We’ve got to stop using veterans as political pawns

Artful Veteran Affairs

Department of Veteran Affairs has for its mission statement: To fulfill President Lincoln´s promise: “To care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan” by serving and honoring the men and women who are America´s Veterans. Naturally, funds are needed to serve the purpose, but how come it is that the VA goes on an art shopping spree while our Veterans’ life span is dramatically reduced by inhuman living conditions and lack of medical care? While the department worries about overpayments to ex-soldiers and scrupulously “saves” millions of dollars on benefits it seems that blowing six zero figures on “artwork” can do no harm.

This VA Santa forgot about gifts such as food and shelter, yet splurged on a 27 foot artificial Christmas tree ($21,000 only) for our homeless Veterans to admire al fresco… More than half a million dollars worth of rock sculptures are somehow necessary in a facility for blind Veterans and an army of ´´art consultants´´ is allegedly vital for VA´s transformation. The $ 1 billion over budget Aurora facility, for example simply could not do without Brazilian wood and “a glass concourse the size of a football field” goo.gl/0Vye1n, not to mention the indispensable 70-foot-high glass walls… The enormous budget and lack of accountability have certainly helped Secretary McDonald to hone his decoration skills. The VA´s Martha Stewart wannabe creative freedom and aesthetic appetite have clearly increased from his P&G days when he was reduced to boasting about empty drawers in his office and horsing around with a weird Japanese stick…

Secretary McDonald seemed unfazed by the September 28th subpoena and artfully skipped topic of the Denver Titanic and art expenditures, craftily turning over 18 of 71 required items of evidence. Rightly angered, Rep. Jeff Miller, Chairman, House Committee on Veterans´ Affairs demanded answers and stated: “We simply will not tolerate VA’s attempts to keep information related to its wasteful art expenditures and the biggest construction failure in VA history shrouded in secrecy. Sec. McDonald must immediately comply with the terms of this subpoena.” Well, it would be about time to stop pampering Secretary McDonald with Hillary Clinton-like legal privileges; until now there are not only answers but questions which are missing. How come that the VA could afford Blue Eclipse $250 000 hanging bubbles- Bravo Sierra- piece of art, while neglecting burials and leaving bodies of our Veterans to decompose? How is it possible that the Los Angeles Homeless Veterans Leasing Act was signed into Law? Our homeless defenders are “outdoors” while the VA brazenly shares property inherited by Veterans with local elite members in overt violation of the most basic human rights such as Article 17 .2 : “ No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his property”.

Continued below... Who gave orders to VA police to harass, brutalize and charge our elderly Veterans with displaying a “ placard”? Who decided that our much loved American flag is a placard? Why are crimes against our Veterans being tolerated, the wrongdoers promoted and whistleblowers persecuted? When we will see arrests for rampant corruption, fraud and despicable treatment of our Veterans? The last, but not the least - House Committee on Veterans´ Affairs should issue an official statement “Whenever Secretary McDonald says something, he means the contrary”. Recently, VA Secretary said: “We’ve got to stop using veterans as political pawns”.

Most Americans today are the products of an intentionally degraded educational system, and completely unaware that Marx, Mao, Castro

Obama and the Death of American Liberty

Confederate General Jeb Stuart once remarked that he did not want to survive the death of liberty in his country. On May 11, 1864, Stuart was gravely wounded during a Calvary charge, and on May 12, his wish was granted. In this time of immense challenge and opportunity, I think we would all do well to ponder the caliber of such a man, regardless of our political affiliations or heritage.

The reason is that we appear to have elected the first American President likely to usher in and preside over the death of the greatest political system the world has ever known.



The complicity of the mainstream media in ignoring Obama’s Marxist background – including his longtime alliances with terrorists and terrorist sympathizers –is not unprecedented. Consider that the lifelong grooming of Manchurian candidate Obama began in Hawaii, where, by his own admission, he was ""mentored"" by the leader of a Communist cell, Frank Marshall Davis. Even though Davis was sent to Hawaii to spy on U.S. military installations and edit the Hawaiian Communist newspaper, his fellow travelers in the media only saw fit to report that Davis was a ""poet,"" neglecting that this pedophile’s ""poetry"" waxed most eloquent in praise of Joseph Stalin.



Further ignored by our own media was credible evidence that money from radical Islamists not only financed Obama's education but also his presidential campaign with what is reported to have been hundreds of millions of dollars in illegal overseas contributions.



While the mainstream media continue to fawn over Obama's teleprompter ""eloquence,"" they ignore other credible evidence that the Communist terrorist William Ayers ghostwrote Obama's ""Dreams of My Father."" For his part, Obama remains steadfast in his refusal to release any of his university papers that could easily disprove this assertion, if indeed it is untrue. Yet, the media just issue their collective yawns. The hypocrisy is nearly incalculable. One can only imagine the furious non-stop assault upon McCain, Palin or any other conservative if it were suspected that a domestic terrorist such as Timothy McVeigh ghostwrote their memoirs.

Yet, the media just issue their collective yawns. The hypocrisy is nearly incalculable. One can only imagine the furious non-stop assault upon McCain, Palin or any other conservative if it were suspected that a domestic terrorist such as Timothy McVeigh ghostwrote their memoirs.

Ironically, McCain helped to craft the sword that Obama used to slay not only the McCain campaign but also free and open political discourse. While McCain/Feingold expressly limits the very speech the first amendment sought to protect, the Orwellian “Fairness Doctrine” praised by Democrat leaders will destroy any media source not willing to dispense politically correct propaganda at the behest of the Obama regime. Yes, change is coming. They may not call it the “Fairness Doctrine” but rest assured whether it comes under another name or program, the thought police will be on patrol to intimidate, harass or shut-down those pesky dissenters. Moreover, religious leaders, who from the days of our Founders until the mid 1950s regularly opined on matters political, now face fines and imprisonment if they do not meekly acquiesce to a truncated exposition of the Word they claim is relevant to all arenas of life. To avoid these recriminations, one must be a liberal, a minority, or both. The dearth of conservative pastors willing to challenge this unconstitutional abridgment contrasts markedly from the pastors who helped to found this country and served as leaders in the Revolutionary War, when the certain penalty for their civil disobedience was the loss of life. Our culture, by tolerating and even celebrating degeneracy, has largely destroyed the only foundation upon which a free society can stand: moral clarity. The Communist founder of the ACLU, Roger Baldwin, knew this well. While his legacy of well-trained agitators, front-group fellow travelers, and the useful idiots they enlisted, has successfully obliterated the knowledge that civil liberty is inseparable from personal responsibility, they have simultaneously inculcated “the masses” with the belief that civil liberty is a license for irresponsibility. The stated goal of Communism, to destroy us from within, continues unabated. Forgetting Thomas Jefferson’s warning that a “government big enough to give you everything you want is a government big enough to take away all that you have,” Americans “leaders”’ obligingly prostrate themselves before a beast of their own creation – nationalizing the financial industry, the auto industry, the insurance industry, devaluing the currency and condemning generations yet unborn to serfdom. Just as Voltaire cried for “More Light!” in the final moments of his life, those who have set fire to the house of human freedom now cry out for “More Fuel!” Having funded the Communist Chinese military and the infrastructure of Iran, the head of Goldman Sachs, Secretary Paulson, was well suited to dispense the opening pyrotechnics, and current Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has now taken the process nuclear.

Continued below... Our Founders did not delineate a comprehensive list of inalienable rights in the Declaration of Independence. Jefferson summarized them with the words, “Among these are,” then specified the principle three in descending order. The pursuit of happiness does not sanction the trespass of liberty, while the exercise of liberty must honor the right to life. In 1973 when our highest court declared the pre-eminent inalienable right to life to be null and void, it de facto declared that all of our rights were only temporary privileges granted by the state. Using Roe V. Wade as cover, Obama seeks to extend the slaughter of the pre-born to those born alive. The principle crime of the latter, of course, is that they have the “audacity” to survive the attempt to kill them. Perhaps Obama could enlighten the world as to just how old a child must be before that child becomes endowed with the inalienable right to life. The Messianic character of the Obama Cult is directly manifested in those who have deeply imbibed the proclamation of the Humanist Manifesto that mankind “must save itself.” This declaration, a logical descendant of the German philosopher Hegel is, in essence, a deification of the individual (god) and the collective (God). It makes the state the ultimate arbiter of good and evil, and thus makes the doctrine of enumerated powers, espoused by our Founders, passé – a doctrine that is only rational if a transcendent moral authority exists, the jurisdiction of which supersedes human opinion. Never mind that all Utopian Revolutions throughout the ages have produced the worst tyrannies in the history of mankind. The media, having elevated Obama to the status of “Savior,” now consider it a violation of protocol to either question or expose the Marxist and Islamic unseen hands in his rise to power. For those inclined to believe that socialism is somehow either a compassionate or a Christian form of civil government, I share the words of the great theologian Oswald Chambers, who wrote: “The vision of Socialism is magnificent; these are benedictions and blessings for mankind on the line of Socialism, which have never been yet; but once the root is cut from Redemption, it will be one of the most frantic forms of despotic tyranny the human race has ever known. It looks like the lamb, but when the big crisis comes, it gives life to the beast.” This beast, though not fully arisen in the American body politic, is beginning to stir. Egalitarian propaganda works. Most Americans today are the products of an intentionally degraded educational system, and completely unaware that Marx, Mao, Castro, et al, sang the praises of democracy. They viewed democracy as a fundamental precursor to socialism and therefore embraced democracy the same way that Obama and the modern Democrat Party embrace it, as a vehicle to gain the attention, support and participation of the masses in their own enslavement. Upon leaving the Constitutional convention of 1789, Benjamin Franklin was asked, “What form of government have you given us Mr. Franklin?” He responded, “A republic madam, if you can keep it.” Whether we can and whether we will has never been more uncertain. It is here that Obama’s campaign slogan, “Yes, we can” presents an interesting historical irony. If it were spoken in response to Franklin’s solemn warning it would express hope for our republic’s longevity. However, from the mouth of this 21st century Marxist change agent and parroted by a mindless sea of useful idiots, those same words will serve as a requiem and epitaph of the republic - if Obama’s agenda is not stopped. We are not powerless, but expect neither enlightenment nor repentance from the U.S. Congress. All of us, in all our spheres of influence must decide to act with the courage of a Jeb Stuart to take back our fundamental freedoms and say, “Yes, we can” to Franklin and “No, you can’t” to Obama.

8594,9726,Turkish President Erdogan To Meet With Pope Francis In Secret Talks To Overturn Trump Recognition Of Jerusalem,"Turkish President Erdogan To Meet With Pope Francis In Secret Talks To Overturn Trump Recognition Of Jerusalem

% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will visit Pope Francis at the Vatican next month for talks likely to focus on the US recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.

“And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.” Zechariah 12:9 (KJV)

EDITOR’S NOTE: When it became apparent that Donald Trump was going to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, Pope Francis called for urgent prayer that Jerusalem would remain divided and out of Israeli control. Now Turkish president Erdogan will meet with the anti-Israel pope in secret closed-door meetings to discuss what the Muslim response should be. Just as the Vatican had signed concordats with Hitler to help bring the Nazis to power and protect them, they are now aligning with the Muslims to conspire to give control of Jerusalem to the Palestinians.

The Turkish leader and head of the Roman Catholic Church both strongly opposed the move announced by US President Donald Trump at the end of last year.

Erdogan called Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem a “bomb” which would inflame the Middle East and his top diplomat called for the recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine.

Erdogan’s first trip to the tiny state will be on February 5, the Vatican said. It follows phone calls between the two leaders who share concerns over the recognition of Israeli rights to Jerusalem and agree that the status quo should remain.

The Argentine-born pope met Erdogan during his trip to Turkey in November 2014. The return visit will be the first by a Turkish president since 1959.

Erdogan has expressed hope for a better relationship with the European Union after a fractious 2017, despite concerns over human rights violations in Turkey, particularly during the crackdown that followed a failed coup in July 2016.

Francis has repeatedly praised Turkey’s efforts to welcome Syrian refugees and has said the country can be a “great peacemaker”, while also warning against “fanaticism and fundamentalism”.

But the relationship has not always been plain sailing: tensions flared in 2016 when the pope denounced the World War I killing of Armenians as a genocide, enraging Turkey, who has steadfastly denied there was a massacre of Armenians.

Armenians have long sought international recognition for the killings as genocide, but Turkey — the Ottoman Empire’s successor state — argues that it was a collective tragedy in which both Turks and Armenians died. source

4936,5581,"If the Sh*thole Epithet Fits, Wear It","Let’s forget for a moment whether Trump ever called any countries at all sh*tholes. It seems as though the only report we have of this is Dick Durbin’s and Dick Durbin is known to be a fabulist.

However, let’s for a moment contemplate the reactions of the world to this word that might or might not have been said.

Let’s, in particular, contemplate the reactions of the countries that thought themselves insulted.

Take Haiti for instance. Anderson Cooper took offense on behalf of Haiti.

Do you know what strength it takes to survive on rainwater buried under concrete?"" Cooper asked. ""The people of Haiti have been through more ... they fought back against more injustice than our president ever has."" Cooper acknowledged that Haiti, like all countries, contained a mix of people but characterized Haitians as widely having a distinct dignity. ""It's a dignity many in this White House could learn from,"" Cooper said. ""It's a dignity that the president, with all his money and power, could learn from as well.

Sure, Mr. Cooper. But you know what? Whenever there is any big disaster, there are always people who survive on rainwater buried in concrete or the equivalent. I would expect you to remember the people who dug and dug in the rubble of the World Trade Center, long after it became obvious that there would be no survivors, hoping to get maybe a sliver of something that could allow a family to identify a loved one.

Sure, every country has the good and the bad, and some countries, like Haiti, require more fortitude to survive than just about anywhere else.

Since Haitians freed themselves from slavery and stopped growing the one commercial crop the island was capable of — sugar — they’ve been a basket case living off international charity. (Not that I blame them, since growing and harvesting sugar at the time was a miserable endeavor.) The island has been deforested, and the poverty is appalling.

But, Mr. Cooper, the fact that the people of Haiti have survived enormous adversity doesn’t make the place where they live not a sh*thole. On the contrary. It makes it a sh*thole that takes an enormous amount of strength and endurance to survive, but it is still a sh*thole.

And that’s why their people try to come here by the droves. But the fact that it’s a sh*thole or that its people are suffering doesn’t obligate us to take immigrants from Haiti. Because we are not a sort of charity shelter that takes in the deserving. We’re a country that takes in people who might become productive citizens. In those terms, Haitians should be judged as everyone else: “What do you bring to America, and what can you do for America?”",https://pjmedia.com/trending/epithet-fits-wear/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

1218,1425,"Baptist upbringing inspires sociologist’s study of SBC controversy, American faith – Baptist News Global","Sociologist Nancy Ammerman’s first book was about Bible-believing fundamentalists living in a modern world. That was in 1987.

Her next book, published in 1992, offered a comprehensive look at the turmoil consuming the Southern Baptist Convention.

Those works, as well as her research and writing interests since then, were inspired and informed by an indelible Baptist upbringing.

“My career as a sociologist studying religious communities started from being a preacher’s kid,” said Ammerman, who is a professor of sociology of religion at Boston University.

And not just any preacher’s kid, but a Southern Baptist preacher’s kid. Eventually, that would imbue her with credibility and insights other scholars may not enjoy in researching churches.

“My family’s theology was conservative enough that I could pass in a fundamentalist church,” Ammerman said. “I could get along. I knew what they were talking about.”

The experience also imparted a natural interest in the controversies then embroiling the SBC.

“I would say things like, ‘what’s going on in the SBC is so interesting. Somebody should study this,” said Ammerman, then in her first professorial position at Emory University in Atlanta.

Eventually she made that statement to Southern Baptist journalist Walker Knight.

“Walker said, ‘Well, why not you?’”

She dove in, spending three years in intense study that included interviewing more than 100 people on all sides of the issue, including agency heads and key decision makers. Ammerman studied publications and tapes of floor debates. With the help of the Baptist Sunday School Board (now LifeWay Christian Resources), she conducted extensive surveys of more than 1,000 Southern Baptists, including pastors, Women’s Missionary Union presidents, chairs of deacon boards and others.

The resulting book, Baptist Battles: Social Change and Religious Conflict in the Southern Baptist Convention, traced the controversy’s roots not to traditional, rural Baptist churches but to Southern Baptists in urban contexts who were disturbed by a changing world, Ammerman said.

It was an experience that hit close to home.

“The more I wrote and the more I read, I thought ‘I’m living this,’” she said.

Being raised in church helped Ammerman with other aspects of sociology.

Socially, preachers’ kids are both insiders and outsiders in their congregations. Frequent moves forces them continually to establish and re-establish their roles and places in churches.

Likewise, a sociologist’s role “is to observe and learn the culture of a place” while remaining “a little bit on the outside,” she said.

Congregations impact personal faith

Ammerman said her Baptist heritage also imparted an appreciation for the important roles congregations play in personal faith. The ways religion is lived out, and how that is nurtured by religious groups, is one of Ammerman’s academic interests.

“I grew up thinking congregations were pretty important. I think my focus on congregational life is really rooted in local church autonomy.”

Access to those communities has generated a body of work that illuminates the practical roles faith plays in individual lives.

Her first project, Bible Believers: Fundamentalists in the Modern World, focused on the religious experiences of the members of an independent Baptist church in New England.

Ammerman published Pillars of Faith: American Congregations and their Partners in 2005 to describe how diverse congregations function.

She also has published articles on the spiritual-but-not-religious phenomenon and on the local, social and religious dimension of congregations, among others.

Tying much of it together is an interest in “lived religion,” or how faith is experienced and interpreted by ordinary people.

And that often overlaps with the spiritual-but-not-religious language that permeates American culture.

That phrase “gets used as a way to say, ‘I am somebody who recognizes there is a spiritual dimension to life, that there is something beyond myself — but please don’t associate me with those bad religious people,’” Ammerman said. “They are making the distinction between what they think spirituality means and what they think religion means.”

That’s one of the ways people describe their faith. Teasing out such bottom-up definitions of religious experience is important in understanding faith in American culture.

Asking people if they believe in God is often met with uncertain or negative responses.

“But if we ask, ‘Do you ever light candles, do you celebrate Christmas, do you pray on certain occasions, do you still have your rosary beads?’” she said. “Then we find out there is a layer of religious practice and a sense of religiosity that is under the surface.”

But research has demonstrated that while there is a distrust of organized religion, “there are very few people who are engaged in deep spiritual life who are not participants in religious communities,” Ammerman added.

8416,9520,10 Highly Intelligent Questions to Ask Your Relatives this Thanksgiving…(or Not),"10 Highly Intelligent Questions to Ask Your Relatives this Thanksgiving…(or Not)

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

By: Mike Adams / Natural News

Isn’t it fascinating how the mainstream media is instructing people what to ask their family members this Thanksgiving? As usual, the questions they pose are all about promoting a specific political narrative, such as asking your hosts whether they “own guns” (with the presumption being that it’s bad if they do).

To counter the complete idiocy of the mainstream media’s mind-numbing conversation starters, I’m proposing a much more useful list of eye-opening questions you might consider asking family members this Thanksgiving… or not, depending on how much you want to get along with them.

One disclaimer, though: Don’t blame me if this is the last Thanksgiving you have with some of your family members.

#1) Is there MSG in that turkey gravy?

The very best way to make friends at Thanksgiving is to start questioning all the ingredients in the food you’re being served. An easy target to go after is the MSG (monosodium glutamate) that’s found in nearly all “gravy” mixes. I put “gravy” in quotes because it’s not really gravy at all if it’s from a mix. Real gravy comes from animal greaseand doesn’t need any MSG because it tastes awesome all by itself. While you’re at it, check the turkey stuffing ingredients, too, because those products often contain MSG or yeast extract, a “hidden” form of MSG. Bottom line? Real friends make gravy out of animal grease, not store-bought powdered mixes. That’s just fake gravy, which people eat when they’re watching the fake news (CNN).

#2) Do you believe biological sex is determined by genetics, or by wishful thinking?

This is a real conversation starter. You’ll quickly find out how many of your family members no longer believe in biological cause and effect. If they believe that sex or gender can be changed with a wish, ask them why a person can’t wish they were 30 years younger, or a different ethnicity, or even a Tibetan Snow Leopard. There’s a Caucasian man in America who literally believes he’s a Filipino woman. I hope he’s not at your Thanksgiving dinner.

#3) Are you seriously serving unfiltered TAP water?

Here’s a Thanksgiving day favorite: Take a sip of the crappy, unfiltered tap water you’re being served by your clueless host and experience the chlorine high notes. Then ask your host, loudly in front of everyone else, “Are you seriously serving unfiltered TAP water?” Follow this with a full explanation of the toxic cancer-causing chemicals found in tap water, and be sure to cover the fact that municipal water treatment facilities don’t remove birth control chemicals, pharmaceuticals or agricultural pesticides from the water supply. This will make you extremely popular and get you invited back for Christmas dinner, too!

#4) If you don’t yet own a gun, WHY NOT?

It’s a crazy, dangerous world. Self-defense is a fundamental divine right that’s reflected throughout nature. Possessing a weapon of self-defense is, in essence, a perfect reflection of Mother Nature and the natural world of plants, animals, insects and even bacteria. Make sure you explain to your host that even beetles, bacteria and bamboo plants have self-defense characteristics, and humans should too. If they tell you they don’t “believe” in guns, arrogantly explain that the laws of kinetic physics don’t require “belief” in order to function. This will win you even more friends than you ever thought possible.

#5) What do Charlie Rose, Bill Cosby, Bill Clinton, Louis C.K., Al Franken, Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey all have in common?

Aside from the fact that they all sexually harassed, abused or exploited women — or in some cases raped women — they all also happen to be left-wing liberals who publicly proclaimed their support for “women’s rights.” Nearly every one of them also supported Hillary Clinton for president. If you really want to bring out the love this Thanksgiving, bring up Hillary Clinton in the middle of, “Can you please pass the mashed potatoes?” Or, conversely, you can take a whack at Trump with a flippant remark such as, “Hey, did you notice the way this gravy spilled all over the mashed potatoes, it looks just like President Trump’s HAIR?”

#6) When family members describe how far they traveled to get there, remind them they’re all destroying the planet with climate change

In order to appease the climate alarmists, you must calculate the volume of carbon dioxide emitted by each family member as they drove or flew their way into town. Ask each person how many gallons of gas they burned, or how many miles they flew. Then insist they all purchase “carbon dioxide offset credits” which is, of course, exactly what world governments want to force nations to do. If they resist, remind them that if they don’t purchase offset credits, they are evil people who are destroying planet Earth. After all, that’s what the climate change people do.

#7) Bring some syringes and a vaccine vial, and demand everyone be vaccinated on site

To further win friends and influence people, bring a vaccine vial and some syringes, then demand that every person agree to be vaccinated on site, or else be labeled an “anti-vaxxer.” If they refuse to be vaccinated, scream at them relentlessly while labeling them, “ANTI-SCIENCE!” This is, of course, exactly what the vaccine industry does every day, usually in conjunction with the scientifically illiterate mainstream media. If your family members ask what the vaccine is for, just explain it’s for “Idiopathy,” which has a funny double meaning in medicine.

#8) If SHTF right now, what is your escape plan from this place?

A great way to put your relatives’ minds at ease is to start asking about their escape plans if a North Korean ICBM detonates an EMP weapon over America. You may have to educate your family members about EMP weapons, of course, since they probably don’t know anything about physics or electronics, but once you get through all that, ask them about their survival plans when the country’s power grid goes down. This is how you can turn a depressing Thanksgiving into a joy fest of love and uplifting hope.

#9) Ask everybody to disclose all the medications they’re taking, then remind them how medications don’t work

Here’s another amazing way to win friends: Ask people to name all the medications they’re taking, then explain why those medications don’t really work in the long run. Because people have a near-religious worship of their pharmaceuticals, this might get you kicked out onto the street, so you can always resort to the old what’s in the bathroom medicine cabinet trick to find out for yourself. Just remember: The more meds they’re on, the crazier they probably are to begin with, so use this approach only if you’re pretty sure you can overpower them in a mixed martial arts contest.

#10) Ask people what they want for Christmas, then condemn them as shallow “materialists”

Merely mentioning the word “Christmas” might get you disinvited from some households, but since you’re probably not going to win any popularity contests anyway, you might as well find out what people hope to acquire in terms of gifts. Whatever they tell you they want, condemn it as materialistic and shallow. Unless, of course, they say they want to “end climate change,” in which case you remind them how much fuel they burned to get there.

Lastly, to really get the conversation going, rustle up 15 – 20 illegal aliens — er, I mean undocumented immigrants — on your way to the gathering, then invite them all to the food table by demanding “NO BORDERS” for Thanksgiving dinner. This will very quickly determine how many progressives in your family actually believe what they are saying about no borders or boundaries.

Or you could say nothing and pretend to get along with incredibly uninformed people

Or, instead of all the above, you could laugh along with casual jokes, brain-dead political talk and senseless banter in the interests of getting along with people. After all, it’s Thanksgiving, and that’s a time to fake your way through the senseless conversationin the interests of peace and unity.

Obviously, much of what I’ve written here is offered in jest, but it’s very true that our readers tend to be the smartest people in any family gathering, so we all share this common experience of having to “downgrade” our conversation to the lowest common denominator in any given group. Sometimes, it’s a necessary thing for the sake of civility, but if you’re like most intelligent people, you can’t wait to get out of there and get back to work on the things that really matter.

As for myself, I’m fortunate to have a really tuned-in family who are all into prepping, holistic health and critical thinking. You can thank them for raising me with that same philosophy, by the way, which is an incredible gift compared to the dumbed-down upbringing too many children receive these days. I hope your family is as well-informed as mine, because that allows us to talk about prepping, holistic health, geopolitics and many other advanced subjects that run-of-the-mill audiences can’t fathom.

In any case, I wish you a wonderful Thanksgiving, and be sure to participate in our Black Friday Deals at the Health Ranger Store to continue supporting our mission.

% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

Pointing towards the near future possibility of Russia and the Pacific theater being the next major areas of conflict, a US Marine Corps commandant warned troops station in Norway to be prepared for a coming war.

As Military.com reports, the stated goals of the Marine Corps’ newest rotational force in Norway are to enhance partnerships with European allies and improve the service’s ability to fight in cold weather.

But on a brief visit to the 300-member unit ahead of Christmas, the commandant and the sergeant major of the Marine Corps both described the strategic role the small unit fills — and the fact that a peacetime mission can be preface to combat if circumstances change.

“I hope I’m wrong, but there’s a war coming,” Gen. Robert Neller told them. “You’re in a fight here, an informational fight, a political fight, by your presence.”

Fox News writes that Neller pointed to the near future possibility of Russia and the Pacific theater being the next major areas of conflict.

Sgt. Maj. Ronald Green sounded a similar tone.

“Just remember why you’re here,” Green said. “They’re watching. Just like you watch them, they watch you. We’ve got 300 Marines up here; we could go from 300 to 3,000 overnight. We could raise the bar.”

The warnings came a day before Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told troops at Fort Bragg, N.C., that “storm clouds are gathering” over the Korean Peninsula.

At a Q&A session with the troops in the Norwegian Home Guard base near Trondheim, Neller said that the U.S. could shift its focus from the Middle East to Eastern Europe, citing Russia’s conflicts with Ukraine and Georgia as justification.

He told the Marines that they should be prepared for a “big-ass fight” on the horizon.

9370,10584,Nation Needs A Dose Of Louisiana Resiliency,"August 31, 2012…On the seventh anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, the people of Louisiana were struck again by Hurricane Isaac. This storm was not as powerful or deadly as Katrina, but it was a monster nonetheless. It might have been the strongest Category 1 hurricane in history. Initial estimates of property damage exceed $2 billion and that amount will surely rise. Over one million people lost power throughout the region. While New Orleans was mostly spared, homes were destroyed in nearby Plaquemines Parish, as well as parts of LaPlace and Slidell. Unfortunately, the threat is not over as rising waters continue to endanger vast regions of the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain.

Along with frequent hurricanes, the area has faced yellow fever epidemics, carpetbaggers, Reconstruction, crime waves, political corruption, massive floods and coastal erosion among a host of other disasters. We are certainly survivors in a beautiful, but very tough environment.

In our colorful history, we have faced hurricane threats almost yearly, but the people of Louisiana refuse to surrender to Mother Nature. The aftermath of Hurricane Isaac will be no different. This spirit of resiliency has been a hallmark of our region since Bienville founded New Orleans almost 300 years ago.

Sadly, there were several reported fatalities, but courageous volunteers and first responders worked tirelessly to rescue scores of stranded homeowners fleeing floodwaters. Isaac is the latest in a string of powerful storms to devastate the region. In the past seven years, Louisiana and our neighbors along the Gulf Coast have been ravaged by a series of fierce tropical systems: Cindy, Katrina, Rita, Ike, Gustav, Claudette, Ida, Bonnie, Lee, and of course Isaac.

After each challenge, the vast majority of residents return to reclaim their property and rebuild their homes, vowing not to abandon their beloved state. The rest of the nation could learn a great deal from studying the incredible resiliency of the people of Louisiana.

The American people need to have the same fighting spirit as the people of Louisiana who keep coming back from one disaster after another. As Louisiana residents refuse to surrender in the face of hurricane damage, this nation needs to refuse to surrender to the economic woes we now face.

At the present time, an economic hurricane has devastated the country. The news keeps getting worse as Americans are facing a high unemployment rate, anemic economic growth, rising food and gasoline prices and a housing industry that is in a depression. Food stamp recipients are at an all time high and more Americans than ever are classified as poor.

To recover, America must once again start to believe in itself. A change in attitude is more important than any program or policy introduced by the government. In fact, some good old fashioned optimism is required once more. America needs the type of confidence boost that was offered by President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. It was a key factor in his successful economic program.

Clearly, this message was not lost on the Republicans gathering in Tampa this week. In his acceptance speech, VP candidate Paul Ryan addressed these issues. As he said to the country, “we can do this,” and overcome these immense economic challenges, but we desperately need a change of direction. In his address, Mitt Romney vowed to “restore the promise of America” after four years of disappointment.

Sadly, the Obama administration offers no solutions and continued misery. It basically accepts the poor economy and advocates only more government spending and more dependency. The President presents to the nation despair and dejection, that the government is the only answer.

In contrast, the Republican Party needs to heartily embrace an alternative plan, namely free enterprise, the resurgence of the private sector and the re-creation of a country that is not dependent on the government for survival. In essence, the GOP needs to stress good old fashioned Louisiana self reliance.

In Louisiana, this personal resiliency, not government assistance, is the reason so many people continue to live in a state that is prone to hurricanes and other natural disasters. While the government may help, it will not restore Louisiana in the aftermath of Isaac. Instead, it will require the hard work of storm victims, along with their friends and family, toiling night and day to rebuild. This familiar story has been replayed countless times in the 300 year history of this region. This attitude will allow this state to continue to prosper, despite tragedies, whether the government helps or not.

Here in Louisiana, we love our families and friends, our cherished traditions and history, the beautiful architecture and unique culture, our wonderful food and festivals, the scenic beauty and sporting paradise, and the incomparable musical and political heritage of our state. Our roots run deep in Louisiana, it defines who we are, so we stay and live to fight another day.

This country needs that same spirit to continue to fight this economic downturn. Hopefully, after hard work, resilience and a change in direction our nation will be able to rejoice in that favorite Louisiana expression, “Laissez les bons temps rouler.”

Our nation is a long way from good times today, but if the Obama administration is replaced, we will be one huge step closer.",http://canadafreepress.com/article/nation-needs-a-dose-of-louisiana-resiliency,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
162,190,Family Security Matters,"Clinton–Obama Emails: The Key to Understanding Why Hillary Wasn't Indicted

January 24, 2018

New FBI texts highlight a motive to conceal the president's involvement.

From the first, these columns have argued that the whitewash of the Hillary Clinton-emails caper was President Barack Obama's call - not the FBI's, and not the Justice Department's. (See, e.g., here, here, and here.) The decision was inevitable. Obama, using a pseudonymous email account, had repeatedly communicated with Secretary Clinton over her private, non-secure email account.

These emails must have involved some classified information, given the nature of consultations between presidents and secretaries of state, the broad outlines of Obama's own executive order defining classified intelligence (see EO 13526, section 1.4), and the fact that the Obama administration adamantly refused to disclose the Clinton-Obama emails. If classified information was mishandled, it was necessarily mishandled on both ends of these email exchanges.

If Clinton had been charged, Obama's culpable involvement would have been patent. In any prosecution of Clinton, the Clinton-Obama emails would have been in the spotlight. For the prosecution, they would be more proof of willful (or, if you prefer, grossly negligent) mishandling of intelligence. More significantly, for Clinton's defense, they would show that Obama was complicit in Clinton's conduct yet faced no criminal charges.

That is why such an indictment of Hillary Clinton was never going to happen. The latest jaw-dropping disclosures of text messages between FBI agent Peter Strzok and his paramour, FBI lawyer Lisa Page, illustrate this point.

For the moment, I want to put aside the latest controversy - the FBI's failure to retain five months of text messages between Strzok and Page, those chattiest of star-crossed lovers. Yes, this ""glitch"" closes our window on a critical time in the Trump-Russia investigation: mid December 2016 through mid May 2017. That is when the bureau and Justice Department were reportedly conducting and renewing (in 90-day intervals) court-approved FISA surveillance that may well have focused on the newly sworn-in president of the United States. (Remember: The bureau's then-director, James Comey, testified at a March 20 House Intelligence Committee hearing that the investigation was probing possible coordination with Trump's campaign and Kremlin interference in the election.)

The retention default has been chalked up to a technological mishap. Assuming that this truly was an indiscriminate, bureau-wide problem - that lost texts are not limited to phones involved in the Trump-Russia investigation - it is hard to imagine its going undetected for five months in an agency whose business is information retention. But it is not inconceivable. Attorney General Jeff Sessions maintains that an aggressive inquiry is underway, so let's assume (for argument's sake, at least) that either the texts will be recovered or a satisfactory explanation for their non-retention will be forthcoming.

For now, let's stick with the Clinton-Obama emails.

Only July 5, 2016, Comey held the press conference at which he delivered a statement describing Mrs. Clinton's criminal conduct but nevertheless recommending against an indictment. We now know that Comey's remarks had been in the works for two months and were revised several times by the director and his advisers.

This past weekend, in a letter to the FBI regarding the missing texts, Senate Homeland Security Committee chairman Ron Johnson (R., Wis.) addressed some of these revisions. According to Senator Johnson, a draft dated June 30, 2016 (i.e., five days before Comey delivered the final version), contained a passage expressly referring to a troublesome email exchange between Clinton and Obama. (I note that the FBI's report of its eventual interview of Clinton contains a cryptic reference to a July 1, 2012, email that Clinton sent from Russia to Obama's email address. See report, page 2.) The passage in the June 30 draft stated:

We also assess that Secretary Clinton's use of a personal email domain was both known by a large number of people and readily apparent. She also used her personal email extensively while outside the United States, including from the territory of sophisticated adversaries. That use included an email exchange with the President while Secretary Clinton was on the territory of such an adversary. [Emphasis added.] Given that combination of factors, we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton's personal email account.

On the same day, according to a Strzok-Page text, a revised draft of Comey's remarks was circulated by his chief of staff, Jim Rybicki. It replaced ""the President"" with ""another senior government official.""

This effort to obscure Obama's involvement had an obvious flaw: It would practically have begged congressional investigators and enterprising journalists to press for the identification of the ""senior government official"" with whom Clinton had exchanged emails. That was not going to work.

Consequently, by the time Comey delivered his remarks on July 5, the decision had been made to avoid even a veiled allusion to Obama. Instead, all the stress was placed on Clinton (who was not going to be charged anyway) for irresponsibly sending and receiving sensitive emails that were likely to have been penetrated by hostile intelligence services. Comey made no reference to Clinton's correspondent:

We also assess that Secretary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail domain was both known by a large number of people and readily apparent. She also used her personal e-mail extensively while outside the United States, including sending and receiving work-related e-mails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. [Emphasis added.] Given that combination of factors, we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton's personal e-mail account.

The decision to purge any reference to Obama is consistent with the panic that seized his administration from the moment Clinton's use of a private, non-secure server system was revealed in early March 2015. I detailed this reaction in a series of 2016 columns (see, e.g., here and here). What most alarmed Obama and Clinton advisers (those groups overlap) was not only that there were several Clinton-Obama email exchanges, but also that Obama dissembled about his knowledge of Clinton's private email use in a nationally televised interview.

On March 4, just after the New York Times broke the news about Clinton's email practices at the State Department, John Podesta (a top Obama adviser and Clinton's campaign chairman) emailed Cheryl Mills (Clinton's confidant and top aide in the Obama State Department) to suggest that Clinton's ""emails to and from potus"" should be ""held"" - i.e., not disclosed - because ""that's the heart of his exec privilege."" At the time, the House committee investigating the Benghazi jihadist attack was pressing for production of Clinton's emails.

As his counselors grappled with how to address his own involvement in Clinton's misconduct, Obama deceptively told CBS News in a March 7 interview that he had found out about Clinton's use of personal email to conduct State Department business ""the same time everybody else learned it through news reports."" Perhaps he was confident that, because he had used an alias in communicating with Clinton, his emails to and from her - estimated to number around 20 - would remain undiscovered.

His and Clinton's advisers were not so confident. Right after the interview aired, Clinton campaign secretary Josh Scherwin emailed Jennifer Palmieri and other senior campaign staffers, stating: ""Jen you probably have more on this but it looks like POTUS just said he found out HRC was using her personal email when he saw it on the news.""

Scherwin's alert was forwarded to Mills. Shortly afterwards, an agitated Mills emailed Podesta: ""We need to clean this up - he has emails from her - they do not say state.gov."" (That is, Obama had emails from Clinton, which he had to know were from a private account since her address did not end in ""@state.gov"" as State Department emails do.)

So how did Obama and his helpers ""clean this up""?

Obama had his email communications with Clinton sealed. He did this by invoking a dubious presidential-records privilege. The White House insisted that the matter had nothing to do with the contents of the emails, of course; rather, it was intended to vindicate the principle of confidentiality in presidential communications with close advisers. With the media content to play along, this had a twofold benefit: Obama was able (1) to sidestep disclosure without acknowledging that the emails contained classified information and (2) to avoid using the term ""executive privilege"" - with all its dark Watergate connotations - even though that was precisely what he was invoking.

Note that claims of executive privilege must yield to demands for disclosure of relevant evidence in criminal prosecutions. But of course, that's not a problem if there will be no prosecution.

The White House purported to repair the president's disingenuous statement in the CBS interview by rationalizing that he had meant that he learned of Clinton's homebrew server system through news reports - he hadn't meant to claim unawareness that she occasionally used private email. This was sheer misdirection: From Obama's standpoint, the problem was that he discussed government intelligence matters with the secretary of state through a private email account; the fact that, in addition, Clinton's private email account was connected to her own private server system, rather than some other private email service, was beside the point. But, again, the media was not interested in such distinctions and contentedly accepted the White House's non-explanation.

Meanwhile, Attorney General Loretta Lynch ordered Comey to use the word ""matter"" rather than ""investigation"" to describe the FBI's probe of Clinton's email practices. This ensured that the Democratic administration's law-enforcement agencies were aligning their story with the Democratic candidate's campaign rhetoric. If there was no investigation, there would be no prosecution.

In April 2016, in another nationally televised interview, Obama made clear that he did not want Clinton to be indicted. His rationale was a legally frivolous straw man: Clinton had not intended to harm national security. This was not an element of the felony offenses she had committed; nor was it in dispute. No matter: Obama's analysis was the stated view of the chief executive. If, as was sure to happen, his subordinates in the executive law-enforcement agencies conformed their decisions to his stated view, there would be no prosecution.

Within a few weeks, even though the investigation was ostensibly still underway and over a dozen key witnesses - including Clinton herself - had not yet been interviewed, the FBI began drafting Comey's remarks that would close the investigation. There would be no prosecution.

On June 27, Lynch met with Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, on an out-of-the-way Arizona tarmac, where their security details arranged for both their planes to be parked.

Over the next few days, the FBI took pains to strike any reference to Obama's emails with Mrs. Clinton from the statement in which Comey would effectively end the ""matter"" with no prosecution.

On July 1, amid intense public criticism of her meeting with Bill Clinton, Attorney General Lynch piously announced that she would accept whatever recommendation the FBI director and career prosecutors made about charging Clinton. As Page told Strzok in a text that day, ""This is a purposeful leak following the airplane snafu."" It was also playacting. Page elaborated that the attorney general already ""knows no charges will be brought."" Of course she did: It was understood by all involved that there would be no prosecution.

Knowing that, Lynch had given the FBI notice on June 30 that she'd be announcing her intention to accept Comey's recommendation. Fearing this just might look a bit choreographed, the FBI promptly amended Comey's planned remarks to include this assertion (which he in fact made on July 5): ""I have not coordinated or reviewed this statement in any way with the Department of Justice or any other part of the government. They do not know what I am about to say.""

But they did not need to participate in drafting the statement, and they did not need to know the precise words he was going to use. It was not Comey's decision anyway. All they needed to know was that there would be no prosecution.

On July 2, with the decision that she would not be indicted long since made, Mrs. Clinton sat for an interview with the FBI - something she'd never have done if there were a chance she might be charged. The farce was complete with the Justice Department and FBI permitting two subjects of the investigation - Mills and Clinton aide Heather Samuelson - to sit in on the interview as lawyers representing Clinton. That is not something law enforcement abides when it is serious about making a case. Here, however, it was clear: There would be no prosecution.

All cleaned up: no indictment, meaning no prosecution, meaning no disclosure of Clinton-Obama emails. It all worked like a charm . . . except the part where Mrs. Clinton wins the presidency and the problem is never spoken of again.

It’s really pretty simple.

Turn off your so-called “social media” accounts. All of them.

See how many times you’re invited to social events of any sort.

C’mon folks. Those who claim to know and care about you — who allegedly enjoy your company — they have your phone number or email address, right?

Cut the crap. If someone actually wants you to be present for something because they think you’re worth their time and a valuable addition to whatever they have going on then it’s worth the 15 seconds to toss you an email or text message — right?

Say much less a phone call — that might take a whole minute or two!

I know what you’re going to find out if shut off those so-called “social” accounts:

If you are one of those who believe the consistence lies told by the lame stream media about illegal immigrants, now called “undocumented citizens,” then you are in for a real wake up call!

In the videos below you’ll see countless images of what mass immigration brings to countries and just how the globalists are using them to take down richer countries and turn them into more of a third world country.

But I must warn you the images you are about to see are rather disturbing. They contain thousands of refugees in detention camps across the world and they are being herded like cattle. The first video is from Spielfeld Fluchtlingslager in Austria near the border…

Here is another one from Slovenia….

And what about this one on the border of Hungary and Serbia…

If truth be told the purpose of bringing these Syrian refugees to other countries was not to help them get a better life, as you can clearly see from the videos above, but to implode the countries that they inhabit. Reporter Seeker Daily brings us the latest….

The Goals That the Government Will Accomplish With Mass Immigration Are:

1- Turn more prominent, richer countries into third world countries.

This was a stated goal of Agenda 21, bring the richer countries to the level of that of third world countries. Bringing in refugees will do this.

2- Economic Crisis or an Explosion of our Economy

This is a given, every time we welcome in immigration our economy hits the crapper.

3- Depopulation

This will happen as crime upticks and more ISIS hits our shores with more bomb threats and terrorist activity.

4 – Our Streets Being Policed, Martial Law Style System initiated for the “Safety” of those in America and eventually Gun Confiscation.

Our government will create the problem of mass immigration, then offer the solution of Safety via policed streets and the removal of our guns.

5- Turn the Problem Internally towards their real target Christians, political dissidents, Conservatives, gun owners, veterans.

Now that the governments have created the problem of “terrorism” through immigration. They can deem the word “terrorist” to mean any internal threat, any political dissident, any christian, any speaking badly agains them, etc.

6- A Shove, If Not Full Implementation Into The New World Order

America is not the only country accept immigrants, many more prominent countries in Europe are as well and they are suffering too.

Now check out this report I put out yesterday…

9196,10394,Appalachia's woes show the success of American capitalism,"Warren Buffett has told us that there’s something magical about American capitalism. This isn’t quite true, because other countries have achieved much the same thing. What is true about it is that it is the system itself which has caused the incredible wealth we all enjoy in this modern world. Buffett writes:

In 1776, America set off to unleash human potential by combining market economics, the rule of law and equality of opportunity. This foundation was an act of genius that in only 241 years converted our original villages and prairies into $96 trillion of wealth.

Other places which did much the same thing — that mixture of capitalism, the rule of law and free markets — achieved much the same end. We generally refer to those places as the developed world, while those that didn’t are still the Third World. There is nowhere at all that has become rich, absent some vast natural resource, without adopting this system.

We can show this, too, with the numbers from Angus Madison. The average GDP per capita over history, all countries, all empires, was some $600 a year or so — That's in today's dollars, meaning history was, by our standards, abject destitution for everyone. This is also why we use $1.90 a day (at modern American prices) as our measure of global absolute poverty. Because that’s just what the past was and we celebrate when people, a country, a nation, rise above that historical existence.

Warren Buffett rightly points out that the U.S. has done very much better than that:

You can describe these developments as productivity gains or disruptions. Whatever the label, they explain why we now have our amazing $59,000 of GDP per capita.

But there’s another way for us to point to such success. Elsewhere there’s a piece telling us about how Appalachia suffers from a 100-year capitalist experiment gone wrong. That reliance upon mining, the absence of any other major industry there, leads to this:

Between 2011 and 2015, central Appalachia’s median household income was just over $34,000 — around 63% of what the typical American household earned.

Agreed, Appalachia and the Mississippi Delta, a place with comparable median income, have been vying with each other to be the armpit of the American economy for some time now.

We do need to be slightly careful with those numbers. Obviously, they’re very different from GDP per capita. They’re family numbers, for a start, they don’t include the capital share of the economy either. They also don’t, and this is important, include the things we do to reduce poverty in the U.S. This is before the effects of almost all of the welfare system (food stamps, the Earned Income Tax Credit, Section 8, and all the rest).

But then think about this in that historical sense, a GDP per capita of $600 a year. Or the current global one, something like $8,000 (depends upon who is doing the counting a bit for that one). That we’re worrying about $34,000 a year, that this is poverty, is exactly the example we need of how well that American capitalism has worked over those centuries.

That the poor of our nation live better than 90 percent of anyone only 100 years ago, better than anyone at all from more than 200 years ago, shows just how fabulous an economic system it is.

Sure, it’s not perfect, it could do with some revisions here and there, but this system — the rule of law, markets, and capitalism — delivers in the one thing that truly matters: raising the living standards of the people, most especially poor people. Even more, no other economic system has managed this at all.

4629,5208,The Holy and Capital City of Israel: Jerusalem,"Subscribe to Canada Free Press for FREE

The Holy and Capital City of Israel: Jerusalem



In 1995, Congress passed the Jerusalem Embassy Act, which called on The United States to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. This was always delayed through the mechanism of a six monthly waiver by a president if it was felt inopportune to do so in the face of Arab threats of violence. Successive presidents all spoke of the justice in moving the embassy and recognizing Israel’s capital is Jerusalem. But they all succumbed to perennial Muslim Arab threats of intimidation and aggression. All the presidents since 1995 -Clinton, Bush and Obama - used the waiver. None had the courage to do what President Trump has now so magnificently and proudly accomplished. Here is an American president who defies the genocidal intentions and threats of terror and violence hurled towards the embattled Jewish state by much of the Islamic and Arab world. In this he puts to rights a cruel policy adopted by large swathes of an often hostile world, which would deny the Jewish people not only their historical and ancestral homeland but their very 3,000 year old capital: Jerusalem.

Jerusalem has been the eternal capital of only one people in all of that same recorded history: the Jewish people. The Jewish Bible along with the Talmud and the Midrash tell us that the Torah, (the first five books of the Holy Bible) its light and its message, is to be broadcast to the entire world from one specific place: Jerusalem. Each time the Torah scroll is taken from the Ark to be read during synagogue services the following prayer is always sung. “For out of Zion shall go forth the Torah (Law) and the word of God from Jerusalem.” (Isaiah 2:1 and Micah 4:2) In the complete Jewish Bible (the Tanach) the words Jerusalem and Zion appear 821 times with Jerusalem appearing 667 times and Zion appearing 154 times. Both Zion and Jerusalem are considered synonymous. In the Christian Bible - itself an account of Jewish personalities whose lives were formed within Judea, the Jewish Roman province, as well as in the Galilee - the name Jerusalem appears 154 times and Zion seven. In the Islamic Koran, Jerusalem and Zion do not appear at all. Indeed, it was only after the Arabs, under their new banner of Islam, conquered Jerusalem in the year 638 that they created Islamic history in and around Jerusalem. We are told that Mohammed flew on his magic horse to a place called Al Aksa, which means simply the farthest place. Much later, and for political reasons to do with historic, temporal and spiritual Jewish and Christian ties to Jerusalem, did Muslims name the Holy City as their Al Aqsa and placed a mosque on the site where the two holy Jewish temples had stood. Let me quote the words from 1918 of the great Rabbi J.H. Hertz, Chief Rabbi of Great Britain, at the thanksgiving service for the liberation of Jerusalem from the Ottoman Turks by British forces. He spoke of the nearly 4,000 years of history since the time of the first Jew, Abraham, that bound the Jews to their spiritual and physical capital city and of their fate in defending it against its many conquerors: “Like the Jew, this Holy City of Israel is deathless; fire and sword and all the engines of destruction have been hurled against it in vain. The Babylonians burnt it and deported its population; the Romans slew a million of its inhabitants, razed it to the ground, passed the ploughshare over it and strewed its furors with salt; Hadrian banished its very name from the lips of men, changed it to Aelia Capitolina and forbade any Jew from entering it on pain of death. Persians and Arabs, Barbarians, Crusaders and Turks took it and re-took it, ravaged it and burnt it; and yet, marvelous to relate, it ever rises from its ashes to renewed life and glory.”

Rabbi Hertz was talking on the very day that 2,080 years earlier, Judah Maccabee, the legendary Jewish hero, led his warriors against the Greek-Syrians to liberate the Holy City from its heathen occupiers, entered the Temple, and re-dedicated it to the glory of the One and Only God. Rabbi Hertz ended his speech by proclaiming the prophetic teaching of the Maccabean Festival, we know as Hanukah, in Zechariah, 4:6: “Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit, saith the Lord of Hosts.” Jewish sources speak of the seventy names by which Jerusalem is referred to in the classical Jewish sources. These include Ariel/lion of God (Isaiah 29:1); Kirya Neemana/Faithful City (Isaiah 1:25); Ir Ha’emet (City of Truth (Zechariah 8:3); Klilat Yofi/Paragon of Beauty (Lamentations 2:15); Yefay Nof/ Beautiful Panorama (Psalms 48:3); and the ancient commentary of Rabbi Akiva in Sanhedrin 58a on 1 Chronicles 29:11 Hanetza/Eternity. From the 10th century, the Muslim Arabs still called the city various names that echoed its original Jewish origins. For instance they called it Beit al-Makdis, the Arabic version of the Hebrew name, Beit Ha Mikdash - House of the Sanctuary. The Arabic name, Al-Kuds, is derived from the Hebrew, Ir Hakodesh - City of Holiness. From 1948 to 1967, Jordan invaded and occupied the Jewish biblical and ancestral heartland of Judea and Samaria (the so-called West Bank) along with the eastern half of Jerusalem. Only Pakistan and Britain had ever recognized Jordan’s illegal occupation. Indeed, the British officered Jordanian Arab Legion had forced out at gunpoint the Jewish residents of the Old City and from the neighboring Jewish villages: It was Apartheid and ethnic cleansing, Arab style. The Legion went on to desecrate the Jewish graves on the ancient Mount of Olives, toppling the headstones and using them to build latrines. They desecrated and destroyed over 50 synagogues and forbade Jewish and Christian pilgrims to worship at their holy places. They had turned the Via Delarosa, the Way of the Cross, into a filthy, sewage strewn alley through which Christian pilgrims were forced to walk. Non-Muslims count for little under Islamic Sharia Law. Jordan cut the Holy City in half with barbed wire and erected walls, complete with snipers along the dividing line, killing many Jews in the western half of the city. Another city that was divided against itself was Berlin and President Reagan called upon Soviet President Gorbachev to, “tear down this wall.” The world applauded when the wall came down. In stark contrast, President Obama during his eight baleful years in office - along with much of a hostile world - called upon Israel to re-divide Jerusalem. Obama essentially called upon Israeli Prime Minister to ‘build up a wall.’

Continued below... Only when Israel was able to restore dignity and cleanliness in 1967 to all the holy places after their liberation was the earlier Muslim discrimination against Jews and Christians finally brought to a long and overdue end. Only under Israeli administration has Jerusalem been open for free and unfettered worship to members of all faiths. But this persecution of non-Muslims is par for the Islamic world and it continues today throughout the territory foolishly given to the overwhelmingly Muslim Palestinian Arabs as a result of the grotesquely misnamed Oslo Peace Accords. Throughout the Middle East, Christians are fleeing from Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and the Palestinian Authority itself. The only nation in the Middle East where the Christian population is protected and growing is Israel. In the nineteen years that the Jordanians occupied Judea and Samaria, they never remotely considered it as anything but Jordanian. Certainly they never thought it belonged to another Arab people who later called themselves Palestinians. But the Obama White House, and the relentlessly anti-Israel State Department, nevertheless decided that they would echo the demands of the Palestinian Authority by demanding that Israel stop building homes, not only in Judea and Samaria, but even within Jewish suburbs of Israel’s capital city, Jerusalem; this while illegal Arab settlement building still continues unchecked throughout the area at a feverish pace, financed by the EU and the UN. The modern State of Israel endures a world willing to divide Jerusalem again - even as it celebrates the reunification of Berlin - and to give away ancestral and biblical Jewish lands to an enemy led by a Holocaust denier, Mahmoud Abbas, whose own Fatah organization continues to murder Jews and gleefully claim credit for its crimes.

The terror infested Palestinian Authority demands that the eastern half of Jerusalem must be given to them in order to declare it the capital of a new Arab state called Palestine. Such an independent Arab state called Palestine has never existed in all of recorded history. Palestine has always been a geographical area just as Siberia or Patagonia are: never an independent state. Jerusalem has never been the capital city of any Arab or Muslim people. President Trump, no stranger to irrational hatred levelled against himself, is now the recipient of yet more torrents of venom and abuse because of his principled action in recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. But he towers over his critics as a man blessed with a God given sense of morality and justice. Prime Minister Netanyahu withstood brutal pressure from Barack Hussein Obama and fought to defend Israel’s ability to remain a viable state with an undivided capital city in eternal Jerusalem. President Donald Trump deserves our heartfelt gratitude for recognizing reality and acting with honesty and integrity. Surely now is the time for Jews and Christians alike, and all who reject the twin plagues of Islamic triumphalism and an intolerant Left, to joyously recite Psalm 100.

After braving the cold, the darkness, and the morning commute I returned to the warmth and comfort of my home. As always my neighborhood is a very quiet and solitary place during the work week. After brewing some African coffee that my wife gave me for Christmas I sat down for my morning meditation. Although meditation can sometimes be a restless and difficult experience I still enjoy it most of the time. Think of meditation as going to the gym. It is a form of spiritual exercise. It is not always pleasant in the moment but over time it is beneficial. Of course there are also times when you really enjoy it and feel like you could go on and on. This morning as I sat in silence I had the thought over and over how grateful I am for these days. I feel like I am on an extended retreat. The ice and the snow and the extreme cold increase my sense of isolation. With all due respect to humanity I am loving my solitude. Retirement is not a guarantee for everyone so I am exceedingly grateful that I have been given the means and the opportunity to retire from full time working. Down the road I may venture into part time work or volunteering but for now I have been given the gift of extended and full time retirement.

5773,6609,Fight Over HHS Mandate Not Over Yet,"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. ~ First Amendment to the U .S. Constitution

The Obama administration continues to present itself and its recent mandate as the champions of women’s healthcare and reproductive services. At the same time, the opposition led by the Catholic Church, has taken the position that the mandate intrudes upon the sacred First Amendment right and guarantee of religious freedom. The Catholic Church is not alone in this fight. Many Evangelical Christians and Jews have voiced their concerns as well and are standing with the Church.

Despite guarantees by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the Obama administration continues in its quest to chip away at our Constitutional rights. The Health and Human Services mandate requiring employers to provide insurance that covers contraceptives, sterilizations, and abortive drugs is just the latest.

In a recent letter to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), newly installed Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan addresses the fact that the administration is characterizing the controversy as one about contraception. The administration is giving the impression that this is about access to women’s healthcare. Cardinal Dolan wrote, “They [the Obama administration] know that this is not just about sterilization, abortifacients, and chemical contraception. It’s about religious freedom, the sacred right of any Church to define its own teaching and ministry.”

Staff from the USCCB met with White House staff to discuss concerns about religious liberty and in that meeting, USCCB staff asked if “revisiting the straight-jacketing mandates, or broadening the maligned exemption—are all off the table. They were informed that they are.” Instead of trying to work things out to the satisfaction of both sides, representatives of the White House suggested that the Catholic Church should listen to the “‘enlightened’ voices of accommodation.”

While the bishops are keeping the door open to further discussions with the Oval Office, they are not waiting for any accommodation from that quarter, especially since the White House has “already notified Congress that the dreaded mandates have been published in the Federal Registry ‘without change.’” Instead, they are looking to Congress for recourse. They had hoped to find some in the Senate last week with the Blunt Amendment.

Before a vote on a transportation bill last week, Senator Roy Blunt (R-MO) presented an amendment that would have allowed employers to refuse to cover certain health services. The amendment failed, and as the Cardinal wrote in his letter: our opponents sought to obscure what is really a religious freedom issue by maintaining that abortion inducing drugs and the like are a “woman’s health issue.” We will not let this deception stand.

For their part, the House of Representatives has proposed several pieces of legislation to protect life and religious liberty, including the Life at Conception Act sponsored by Representative Duncan D. Hunter (R-CA) and co-sponsored by 113 other representatives.

In a recent press release, Bishop William Lori, Chairman of the conference’s Ad Hoc Committee on Religious Liberty, stated: “We will build on this base of support as we pursue legislation in the House of Representatives, urge the Administration to change its course on this issue, and explore our legal rights under the Constitution and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.”

So if the administration thinks the Catholic Church and its supporters will meekly accept their edict and go about their business, they may have a rude awakening ahead of them.",http://canadafreepress.com/article/fight-over-hhs-mandate-not-over-yet,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
8750,9917,"In A US First, New Orleans Finds Homes For All Its Homeless Veterans","Source: www.csmonitor.com | Original Post Date: January 9, 2015 –

More than 300 mayors have vowed to end veteran homelessness by the end of 2015. New Orleans celebrated the new year by becoming the first city to do so.

Most people celebrate the New Year by making resolutions. The city of New Orleans rang in 2015 by keeping one.

At 6 p.m. on Jan. 2, social workers in New Orleans moved the city’s last known homeless veteran into his new apartment – becoming the first US city to effectively eliminate veteran homelessness.

Homelessness advocates around the country are hailing New Orleans as a model for cities around the country looking to end homelessness, not just for veterans, but for all people needing a permanent home.

“The solutions that work for veterans are the solutions that work for all people,” says Laura Zeilinger, executive director of the US Interagency Council on Homelessness. “The problem is absolutely solvable when we invest in the practices that we know work.”

This time last year, nearly 50,000 US veterans had no home to call their own, according to an annual count. On Independence Day, first lady Michelle Obama launched the Mayor’s Challenge to End Veteran Homelessness. Since that time, more than 300 mayors, six governors, and 71 other local officials have joined the pledge to house every veteran by the end of 2015.

New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu took that pledge one step further, promising to meet the goal by the end of 2014.

“We owe our Veterans our eternal gratitude for their service and sacrifice to this nation, and making sure they have a place to call home is a small but powerful way we can show our appreciation,” Mayor Landrieu said in a statement Wednesday, announcing that New Orleans had housed all known veterans in the Crescent City.

In total, the city has placed 227 veterans in housing since the start of 2014.

“There’s been a lot of skepticism as to whether this is a problem that we can actually solve and I think that [New Orleans’ progress] is a proof point for us as a nation that this is something that can actually be done,” says Ann Oliva, deputy assistant secretary for special needs at the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

Part of the reason New Orleans was able to achieve this goal first is because the number of veterans needing housing was relatively tenable.

The annual point-in-time count taken in January 2014 found just 193 homeless veterans. Over the course of the year, outreach workers identified an additional 35 veterans who had not been included in that count. However, in the end, the total number of people needing housing placement was relatively small compared with the numbers seen in larger metropolitan areas. The January 2014 count found 714 homeless vets in Chicago, 1,645 in Los Angeles, and 3,739 in New York.

“There are of course other cities and states that have higher numbers, but the kinds of barriers that they have been able to overcome as a partnership within the city of New Orleans is really just a landmark,” Ms. Oliva says. “If they can do it, I think that other communities can do it. And they can definitely be a model for other communities to tackle this in their own community.”

On any given night, homelessness advocates say, there are as many as 600,000 people in the United States sleeping in emergency shelters, abandoned buildings, and park benches because they have no place to go.

The country as a whole has made strides in addressing chronic homelessness. Since 2005, the number of people categorized as homeless declined by 17 percent, according to the National Alliance to End Homelessness.

But the New Orleans story is the first inkling that total eradication, even for one specific subgroup, is actually possible, Oliva says.

The New Orleans model has been built on an all hands on deck approach that relies heavily on coordination between local, state, and federal agencies as well as the non-profit outreach community and private landlords.

UNITY of Greater New Orleans, the lead agency responsible for coordinating all homeless housing and services in the area, worked with 60 nonprofit and government agencies to meet the mayor’s deadline.

An apartment complex was renovated specifically with the goal of housing homeless veterans and is operated by UNITY.

Now that all known homeless veterans have homes, the city has implemented a rapid response plan to make sure that newly homeless veterans can be placed into housing as quickly as possible. The city has committed to housing every newly identified veteran within 30 days.

In most cases, outreach workers are able to finalize housing placements in as little as two weeks, says UNITY Executive Director Martha Kegel.

“We can’t say that no veteran is ever going to be homeless again,” Ms. Kegel says. “But what we can say is that we are not going to have veterans living as homeless for very long.”

3854,4390,Women’s March Organizer Linda Sarsour Accused Of Enabling Sexual Assault Of Female Employee,"Women’s March Organizer Linda Sarsour Accused Of Enabling Sexual Assault Of Female Employee

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

Feminist activist and Women’s March organizer, Linda Sarsour, has been accused of enabling the sexual assault of a female employee who worked for her in 2009 at the Arab American Association, two sources “directly familiar” with the matter tell the Daily Caller.



Linda Sarsour

According to Sarsour’s accuser Asmi Fathelbab, a 37 year old New York native and devout Muslim – a man named Majed Seif who lived in the same building as the Arab American Association began stalking Fathelbab. Asmi tells the Daily Caller that one of Seif’s favorite activities was “sneaking up on her with a full erection.”

“He would sneak up on me during times when no one was around, he would touch me, you could hear me scream at the top of my lungs. He would pin me against the wall and rub his crotch on me.” “depending on what floor I was on, you could hear me scream at the top of my lungs.”

“It was disgusting,” Fathelbab told the Caller. “I ran the youth program in the building and with that comes bending down and talking to small children. You have no idea what it was like to stand up and feel that behind you. I couldn’t scream because I didn’t want to scare the child in front of me. It left me shaking.”

When Fathelbab went to Linda Sarsour to report the sexual assaults, she was dismissed and shamed. “She [Sarsour] called me a liar because ‘Something like this didn’t happen to women who looked like me,’” Asmi says. “How dare I interrupt her TV news interview in the other room with my ‘lies.’”



Fathelbab says Sarsour “regularly body-shamed her” and enabled the sexual assaults, and Sarsour threatened to legal and professional damage if she went public with the sexual assault claims. “She told me he had the right to sue me for false claims,” said Asmi, adding that her abuser “had the right to be anywhere in the building he wanted.”

“I cannot stand by any longer and watch everyone praise a woman that claims to be for women’s rights and someone that fights for women when she herself allowed for abuse to occur to women,” wrote Fathelbab. When Fathelbab went to the president of the Arab American Association’s board of directors, Ahmed Jaber, he too shut her down.

“Jaber told me my stalker was a ‘God-fearing man’ who was ‘always at the Mosque,’ so he wouldn’t do something like that,” Fathelbab claims. “He wanted to make it loud and clear this guy was a good Muslim and I was a bad Muslim for “complaining.” –Daily Caller

In response to these claims, Sarsour attacked Fathelbab – telling her that if she continued to report sexual assaults by Jajed Seif, her allegations would result in disciplinary action. Fathelbab told the Daily Caller that she was once forced to talk to a dectective from the community liaison division about the consequences of making false claims to the authorities.

Two sources who knew Fathelbab while she was employed with the Arab American Association told the Daily Caller that Asmi would return from work “emotionally distressed and in a panic,” describing it as an “unsafe” work environment. Another source who has worked with the Arab American Association for 12 years and spoke on the condition of anonymity said that Sarsour was “militant against other women,” and that they remember witnessing Fathelbab being harassed in the building.

“They made it about her weight, saying she was not attractive enough to be harassed and then swept it under the rug,” the source said. “It was Linda Sarsour, Ahmad Jaber and Habib Joudeh who took care of it.” Habib Joudeh is the vice president of the Arab American Association of New York. –DC

Fathelbab says that she’s now unemployable as a result of going public with her claims.



Linda Sarsour with supporters at Women’s March

Sarsour – a self-proclaimed “racial justice & civil rights activist,” made headlines during the Women’s March for attacking Ayyan Hirsi Ali, a former Muslim who was forced to suffer female genital mutilation. After the 9/11 attacks, Hirsi Ali renounced Islam and ran for Dutch parliament in 2003, winning. In 2006, she rallied against Iran’s development of nuclear weapons, and in 2015, she railed against the Islamic State.

In a now-deleted tweet from 2011, Sarsour – who posed with an alleged Hamas financier in January, said of Hirsi Ali: “I wish I could take their vaginas away – they don’t deserve to be women.”

In July, Sarsour called for a Jihad against the Trump administration “fascists reigning in the White House” at the Islamic Society of North America Convention.

“I hope that we when we stand up to those who oppress our communities that Allah accepts from us that as a form of jihad. That we are struggling against tyrants and rulers not only abroad in the Middle East or in the other side of the world, but here in these United States of America where you have fascists and white supremacists and Islamophobes reigning in the White House,” Sarsour said. “Our number one and top priority is to protect and defend our community, it is not to assimilate and please any other people and authority,” she said. “Our obligation is to our young people, is to our women, to make sure our women are protected in our community.” “Our top priority and even higher than all those other priorities is to please Allah and only Allah,” Sarsour declared.

Watch here:

The Daily Caller received no response from Sarsour in regards to Asmi Fathelbab’s allegations.

6894,7867,Do We Really Consent to Be Governed?,"Do We Really Consent to Be Governed?

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

What gives some people the right to rule others? At least since John Locke’s time, the most common and seemingly compelling answer has been “the consent of the governed.”

Political legitimacy presents a multitude of difficulties when we move from the realm of theoretical abstraction to that of practical realization.

When the North American revolutionaries set out to justify their secession from the British Empire, they declared, among other things: “Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just Powers from the Consent of the Governed.” This sounds good, especially if one doesn’t think about it very hard or very long, but the harder and longer one thinks about it, the more problematic it becomes.

Political Legitimacy

One question after another comes to mind. Must every person consent? If not, how many must, and what options do those who do not consent have? What form must the consent take—verbal, written, explicit, implicit? If implicit, how is it to be registered? Given that the composition of society is constantly changing, owing to births, deaths, and international migration, how often must the rulers confirm that they retain the consent of the governed? And so on and on. Political legitimacy, it would appear, presents a multitude of difficulties when we move from the realm of theoretical abstraction to that of practical realization.

I raise this question because in regard to the so-called social contract, I have often had occasion to protest that I haven’t even seen the contract, much less been asked to consent to it. A valid contract requires voluntary offer, acceptance, and consideration.

I’ve never received an offer from my rulers, so I certainly have not accepted one; and rather than consideration, I have received nothing but contempt from the rulers, who, notwithstanding the absence of any agreement, have indubitably threatened me with grave harm in the event that I fail to comply with their edicts. What monumental effrontery these people exhibit! What gives them the right to rob me and push me around? It certainly is not my desire to be a sheep for them to shear or slaughter as they deem expedient for the attainment of their own ends.

Consent of the Governed

Moreover, when we flesh out the idea of “consent of the governed” in realistic detail, the whole notion quickly becomes utterly preposterous. Just consider how it would work. A would-be ruler approaches you and offers a contract for your approval. Here, says he, is the deal.

I, the party of the first part (“the ruler”), promise:

(1) To stipulate how much of your money you will hand over to me, as well as how, when, and where the transfer will be made. You will have no effective say in the matter, aside from pleading for my mercy, and if you should fail to comply, my agents will punish you with fines, imprisonment, and (in the event of your persistent resistance) death.

(2) To make thousands upon thousands of rules for you to obey without question, again on pain of punishment by my agents. You will have no effective say in determining the content of these rules, which will be so numerous, complex, and in many cases beyond comprehension that no human being could conceivably know about more than a handful of them, much less their specific character, yet if you should fail to comply with any of them, I will feel free to punish you to the extent of a law made by me and my confederates.

(3) To provide for your use, on terms stipulated by me and my agents, so-called public goods and services. Although you may actually place some value on a few of these goods and services, most will have little or no value to you, and some you will find utterly abhorrent, and in no event will you as an individual have any effective say over the goods and services I provide, notwithstanding any economist’s cock-and-bull story to the effect that you “demand” all this stuff and value it at whatever amount of money I choose to expend for its provision.

(4) In the event of a dispute between us, judges beholden to me for their appointment and salaries will decide how to settle the dispute. You can expect to lose in these settlements if your case is heard at all.

In exchange for the foregoing government “benefits,” you, the party of the second part (“the subject”), promise:

Upon sober reflection, the whole idea of consent of the governed is as fanciful as the unicorn.

(5) To shut up, make no waves, obey all orders issued by the ruler and his agents, kowtow to them as if they were important, honorable people, and when they say “jump,” ask only “how high?”

Such a deal! Can we really imagine that any sane person would consent to it?

Social Contracts and Unicorns

Yet the foregoing description of the true social contract into which individuals are said to have entered is much too abstract to capture the raw realities of being governed. In enumerating the actual details, no one has ever surpassed Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, who wrote:

To be GOVERNED is to be kept in sight, inspected, spied upon, directed, law-driven, numbered, enrolled, indoctrinated, preached at, controlled, estimated, valued, censured, commanded, by creatures who have neither the right, nor the wisdom, nor the virtue to do so. To be GOVERNED is to be at every operation, at every transaction, noted, registered, enrolled, taxed, stamped, measured, numbered, assessed, licensed, authorized, admonished, forbidden, reformed, corrected, punished. It is, under pretext of public utility, and in the name of the general interest, to be placed under contribution, trained, ransomed, exploited, monopolized, extorted, squeezed, mystified, robbed; then, at the slightest resistance, the first word of complaint, to be repressed, fined, despised, harassed, tracked, abused, clubbed, disarmed, choked, imprisoned, judged, condemned, shot, deported, sacrificed, sold, betrayed; and, to crown all, mocked, ridiculed, outraged, dishonored. That is government; that is its justice; that is its morality. (P.-J. Proudhon, General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century, trans. John Beverley Robinson. London: Freedom Press, 1923, p. 294)

Nowadays, of course, we would have to supplement Proudhon’s admirably precise account by noting that our being governed also entails our being electronically monitored, tracked by orbiting satellites, tased more or less at random, and invaded in our premises by SWAT teams of police, often under the pretext of their overriding our natural right to decide what substances we will ingest, inject, or inhale into what used to be known as “our own bodies.”

So, to return to the question of political legitimacy as determined by the consent of the governed, it appears upon sober reflection that the whole idea is as fanciful as the unicorn. No one in his right mind, save perhaps an incurable masochist, would voluntarily consent to be treated as governments actually treat their subjects.

Nevertheless, very few of us in this country at present are actively engaged in armed rebellion against our rulers. And it is precisely this absence of outright violent revolt that, strange to say, some commentators take as evidence of our consent to the outrageous manner in which the government treats us. Grudging, prudential acquiescence, however, is not the same thing as consent, especially when the people acquiesce, as I do, only in simmering, indignant resignation.

For the record, I can state in complete candor that I do not approve of the manner in which I am being treated by the liars, thieves, and murderers who style themselves the Government of the United States of America or by those who constitute the tyrannical pyramid of state, local, and hybrid governments with which this country is massively infested. My sincere wish is that all of these individuals would, for once in their lives, do the honorable thing. In this regard, I suggest that they resign their positions immediately and seek honest employment.

Addendum one: “Love it or leave it”: Whenever I write along the foregoing lines, I always receive messages from Neanderthals who, imagining that I “hate America,” demand that I get the hell out of this country and go back to wherever I came from. Such reactions evince not only bad manners, but a fundamental misunderstanding of my grievance.

I most emphatically do not hate America. I was not born in some foreign despotism, but in a domestic one known as Oklahoma, which I understand to be the very heart and soul of this country so far as culture and refinement are concerned. I yield to no one in my affection for the Statue of Liberty, the Rocky Mountains, and the amber waves of grain, not to mention the celebrated jumping frog of Calaveras County.

So when I am invited to get out of the country, I feel like someone living in a town taken over by the James Gang who has been told that if he doesn’t like being robbed and bullied by uninvited thugs, he should move to another town. To me, it seems much more fitting that the criminals get out.

Second addendum: The foregoing (along with a few ill-considered sentences that I have now deleted) was first posted by The Beacon blog in June 2010. I stand by it except for the small revisions just mentioned. However, ultimately, in recognition of the zero probability that the U.S. government would ever treat me decently and would almost certainly only demand greater abasement from me over time, I emigrated from the USA in October 2015. I did not go to a free country; no such country exists. But I did escape some of the more menacing and humiliating aspects of life under the U.S. government as well as the state and local tyrannies that hold the American people hostage.

6227,7117,Outrage as multiple properties in London are only offered to Muslim occupants,"Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

In countries under Islamic law, discrimination against non-Muslims is codified under the sharia. Islamic supremacism forms the basis of Muslim rule. That we are seeing this in London is further proof of the deleterious effects of the islamization of the the UK. Muslim only rentals in Muslim no-go zones.

ANGER as multiple properties in London are only offered to Muslim occupants

Only Brexit, January 22, 2018 (thanks to Mark):

London’s secret Muslim only accommodation has been exposed thanks to Rebel Media and the Daily Star

Hundreds of property adverts on websites such as GumTree were only available for those who are Muslim or of Asian descent.

It’s unbelievable that in this day and age, ‘white people’ or anyone who is not Muslim is discriminated against getting living accommodation.

The Star reported: “Our reporters discovered hundreds more across the UK, including signs for “Asian only” and “Polish only” tenants. The ads echo those of the 1950s and ’60s when landlords hung “Whites only” signs in windows. There are fears the discrimination scandal is fueling a ghetto culture in our towns and cities which could be exploited by far-right groups. In Woolwich, south-east London, tensions have been running high since Army drummer Lee, 26, was murdered by extremists last year. At nearby Jash News, one small ad read: “Room to let for £400 in Plumstead… ONLY FOR ASIAN FAMILY.

Facebook user finds MUSLIM ONLY homes to rent in London and West Midlands

A Facebook user has posted an image showing four separate housing classified adverts in London and the West Midlands that appear to only be accepting Muslim tenants.

The post from a user on the Brexit HQ group, if genuine, proves that such advertisements are effectively ‘slipping through the net’ when it comes to ensuring that equality rules are not broken.

There will naturally be people out there who feel that these landlords and homeowners aren’t doing anything wrong on Gumtree, but at the same time there is one very important question that needs to be asked.

What would happen if the word ‘Muslim’ was changed for another faith group?

We’re not saying this to be Islamophobic in any way – far from it – we are just using this as an example to highlight what we feel is an example of the powers that be picking and choosing what they allow to be posted.

In some cases, it may all boil down to the use of the term ‘Muslims preferred’ instead of ‘Muslims only’ – however many will argue that they both amount to the same thing.",http://beforeitsnews.com/opinion-conservative/2018/01/outrage-as-multiple-properties-in-london-are-only-offered-to-muslim-occupants-3356856.html,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

The truth is, they are the ones spewing Fake News. They are the liars. They are the propagandists. They have the agenda. They are the running dogs of those perverted Rulers who would be your Total Masters

LIES OF MASTERS OF FAKE NEWS

I just did my morning news-prep. I read a bunch of headlines and stories from all over the Net. The headlines alone in Breitbart are enough to stun an elephant. If an elephant could read Breitbart. If the rampant, berserker Dems and Libs could read Breitbart, they would be stunned too. At the truth.

What an unnatural hypocrisy from the ensorcelled, berserker Left! What lies they sing; what evil the anti-Trump-America insectoids chitter of; what ravening, mindless, terrifying creatures of the night they are. I’m talking about the so-called “leadership.” The lying, rotten, totalitarian politicians; the over paid and overfed “news” readers and propagandist script writers; the enablers and agitation propaganda masters like Obama. The direly rampant celebrities, “entertainers,” kneeling athletes, and other proponents of a Leftist World. Probably they stupidly believe they are trying to do something beneficial. I’m not talking about the average, ordinary, devout Democrat. I know some of them. They are not all bad; they are not all evil. They believe religiously in CNN, MSNBC, PBS, Al Jazeera, ABC, CBS, the NYT, and all the rest of the prophesying princelings, gods and Masters of Lies. It’s not the average, inculcated person’s fault if they have been made to believe whatever they are told. They are unable to change. They are unable to disbelieve. They are broken. They seem useless to me.

But, we do NOT want to harm them. They should have no fear of us. Without justification, their masters make them loathe and fear us. Somehow, they don’t see the lies, hypocrisy, and hideous intent of their Royal, Kings-Choice soothsayers and sorcerous word makers. Their weavers of unreality. Those with evil intent who herd them. They don’t grasp how they’ve already chosen to live inside a made up world designed to control and “perfect” them. A world of lies and video-game digital images. A One-World selected for them by foreign trillionaires, dictators, and clandestine Overlords. —These are the Evil insectoids, who cannot live without taking more…and more…and All. —The Global Rulers, who think it is their divine right to be Masters of this Universe. Their made up, lethal headlines and lies are the lattice of an Iron Matrix they have woven around you. Do you want to know what the Matrix really is? Will you take the red pill, or the blue pill? Do you want to see how deep this rabbit hole goes, Alice? Like I said, I read Breitbart’s headlines today. Today is, December 7th. Have you heard that date before? Pearl harbor? December 7th? “December 7, 1941—a date which will live in infamy—the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked ...” Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

THE LYING MEDIA Well. I’m writing to tell you that the new, digital Pearl Harbor raid on America and all Americans has already been launched. It’s all too crazy to discuss and publicize. From BLM, to BHO. From Michael Moore, to more for illegals, and less for vets. There is the stark silliness of, Barry Diller—who raged he would leave America if Trump won. In a mind-numbing turnaround, he is now praising Trump. How’s that for principles and commitment and truth? There are numerous, frightening headlines about the Democrat-Hillary-Obama-Media Axis of Evil. So-called “fake news.” This is nothing more than their latest, outrageous, hideous attack on free speech, truth, justice, and the American way. These totally bogus headlines and stories assert that what you and I report or read is “Fake News.” That our truth, our lives, and our Donald are nothing more than crap, lies, bigoted, Nazis, KKK, “southern attack dogs,” and blah and blah and blah. They never tell you the KKK were ALL Democrats. They never tell you the Nazis were socialists. They never tell you it was Democrats who unleashed the attack dogs in the old civil rights south. They never tell you Governor George Wallace, Chief Bull Connor, and the rest of them were all Democrats. They never tell you Democrat senator Robert Byrd was a Ku Klux Klan Exalted Cyclops. They never tell you it was the Democrat President Lyndon Johnson who publicly called blacks by the name they most loathe. They never tell you it was the Republicans who got the Civil Rights Act passed. You cannot believe these “folks” I’ve cited. The Fakestream Media, Obama and his Democrat Horde, the “entertainers,” foreign trillionaires, kneeling athletes, violent anti-Trump groups, or rabid advocates for illegal aliens—whether from the southern hemisphere, Middle East, Outer Mongolia, or frickin’ Outer Space. If their lips are moving, they are lying. If you can hear them, they are lying. If you can see them or read their words, they are lying. The truth is, they are the ones spewing Fake News. They are the liars. They are the propagandists. They have the agenda. They are the running dogs of those perverted Rulers who would be your Total Masters. And they won’t ever stop. They will never quit; they will never go away, and they will never rest—not ever—not until you and your family and everyone you love or know, are enslaved to their Will and Power and Lust and Glory.

You might have the palette of a discerning diner, but what do you do if you can’t pronounce the items on the menu?

Thankfully, FEMAIL is here to help.

Language learning app, Babbel, has compiled a list of the seven most commonly-mispronounced items on a menu, revealing the correct way to say each.

So how many do you get right?

1. Take the bruschetta, followed by a serve of gnocchi:

They’re popular in Italian cuisine and eateries around the world, and while many people will be partial to ordering bruschetta – or crispy grilled bread topped with garlic and drizzled with olive oil – not so many can say it.

According to Babbel, it’s pronounced broo-SKEH-tah, rather than the oft-used broo-SCHE-tah.

Meanwhile, gnocchi – often served as a main dish with tomato sauce – is pronounced NYOH-kee.

2. A Caipirinha please!:

This tongue-twister is not only a popular alcoholic beverage, but also the national cocktail of Brazil.

And while a Cairpirinha is now popularly customised to your taste by adding the liquor of your choice, the original mix consists of cachaça (a distilled sugarcane spirit) sugar and lime.

How do you pronounce it, though? Kai-pee-REEN-ya is correct, say Babbel.

8441,9547,"Mission San Xavier del Bac, Tucson, Arizona","Once rotting under the burdens of time and the elements - scorching heat, torrential monsoon rains, and well-intentioned, though misguided, encasement in an exterior cement veneer during years past - significant restoration efforts are returning the White Dove of the Desert to its original ecclesiastical glory, resurrected, as it were, with love, sweat, and much-needed financial contributions from private, and ever-dwindling public, resources.

Standing alone for more than 200 years in the harsh desert of southern Arizona above the Santa Cruz River on the Tohono O’odham Reservation ten miles south of Tucson, the Mission San Xavier del Bac is considered to be the finest example of Spanish Colonial architecture in the United States, and the oldest extant European structure in the state of Arizona.

Free and open to the public, 200,000 visitors from around the world pay annual tribute, leaving impressed, no doubt, as we most certainly were, and somewhat humbled. If you come, please, do so quietly with hat in hand, in hushed tones, and don’t ignore the contribution box on your way out. Restoration and maintenance of this gem is an ongoing, expensive endeavor, and every bit of help is greatly appreciated.

Stepping out of the bright Arizona sun into the ornate, almost gaudy, dark interior of Mission San Xavier is to stroll back to the late 18th century. We highly recommend a visit if you’re in the vicinity, even if you’re not Roman Catholic, or are one of the unfortunate who don’t even believe in the Almighty for that matter.

While Father Eusebio Francisco Kino founded the mission in 1692, construction of the magnificent church didn’t begin until 90 years later. If you want to get technical, it was the O’odham Indians (the “Desert People”) who built Mission San Xavier beginning in 1783, albeit under the initial direction of Franciscan missionary Friar Juan Bautista Velderrain who borrowed funds, hired Ignacio Gaona as architect, and rounded up indigenous laborers who did the heavy lifting and grunting, and the dirty, muddy work.

After Velderrain’s death seven years later, Father Juan Abutista Llorens carried on the effort. He oversaw the interior decoration: the painting of murals by unknown artisans, and the commissioning and installation of religious figures and iconic sculpture hauled north on burros from guild shops in Old Mexico.

By 1797, after fifteen challenging years, the mission was officially opened for business, religiously speaking. Like then, San Xavier’s primary function today is to minister to the O’odham, a nation 24,000 strong living on 2.7 million acres, many of whom are Catholic.

For the spiritual joy of it, and to raise restoration funds, the Patronato San Xavier organizes a series of six Christmas concerts over three nights at the church during mid-December. Now in its fifteenth year, rich harmonies of classical music and Christmas tunes performed by the Sons of Orpheus and the Tucson Arizona Boys Chorus can be heard wafting from the sacred halls of the mission, a sold-out affair which the Arizona Daily Star claims is “beyond dazzling - San Xavier music [and] sights are spectacular.” Tickets are $90 per person, $70 of which is tax deductible.

On April 15, 2012, the Clark-Schuldmann Duo also performed here, the fourth annual spring concert popular among chamber music enthusiasts, and likewise aimed at raising restoration funds. Not your typical musicians, the husband and wife cellist-and-pianist team have been described by the New York Times as “an exuberant pair, exhibiting artistic rapport and expressive unity with a quality of ardent commitment that shines through their work.” They have recorded and premiered five dozen works by this country’s most noteworthy composers. These tickets will set you back only $75, $65 of which is tax deductible for restoration purposes.

Because the mission’s history is rich and varied, and the interior and exterior visually stunning, it’s no wonder that San Xavier has been designated a National Historic Landmark. For those who can’t make it to Arizona and experience this marvel first-hand, you can do the next best thing by purchasing “A Gift of Angels: The Art of Mission San Xavier del Bac” by Patronato founder Bernard “Bunny” Fontana and master-photographer Edward McCain. With 175 photographs, and brimming with figures and historical facts, this award-winning book for the ages has been called “gorgeous” by the Review of Arts, Literature, Philosophy and the Humanities, and “stunning” by Midwest Book Review.” Published by UA Press in October, 2010, every public library in America and Canada should have a copy of “A Gift of Angels” on its shelf.

As for the historical record: Mission San Xavier initially fell under New Spain’s jurisdiction, and later became part of the Republic of Mexico in 1821. San Xavier’s last 19th-century resident missionary left the mission in 1837. By 1843 Franciscan administration of all regional missions ended (the Franciscans returned in 1913), after which Mexican priests, the secular clergy, rode the circuit, visiting the mission once a year, if that. Eventually San Xavier was made part of the United States pursuant to the Treaty of La Mesilla, or as Americans call it, the Gadsden Purchase of 1854. Stay with me; its only history.

San Xavier became part of the Santa Fe Diocese in 1859, and by 1866 the incipient diocese at Tucson (vicariate apostolic) and the vicar apostolic, sent clergy on a regular basis to preside over, and minister to, the flock. A civic-minded patronage, the Patronato San Xavier was created in 1978 by numerous community leaders to promote the conservation of Mission San Xavier. And today, dedicated nuns from the Franciscan Sisters of Christian Charity out of Manitowoc, Wisconsin, operate the mission school.

Given the beauty of San Xavier, the tradition and intricate artistic detail, the faux doors and marbling, the multiple adorned domes and sprawling courtyard, and arched doorways, and paintings and deep, rich interior colors, and lofty bell towers, and blinding-white exterior walls, and 200-year-old cracked doors and the Catholic ambiance of the White Dove of the Desert, it’s understandable why people from outside the reservation want to get married here, or baptize their children at this church, notwithstanding the corpse resting under glass off in the corner. Not sure why they do that, but it certainly gave me the willies. Though some requests can be accommodated, most can’t. The mission reasons that while “[e]veryone is welcome to attend masses, special celebrations (like feast days), etc., ... it is our belief that one’s sacramental life should be shared within their local community.” This is perfectly reasonable.

Sometimes lost in the rich melody of chamber music, the clatter of restoration activities, pretty postcards and star-struck tourists meandering the narrow halls of the mission are the Tohono O’odham themselves, a people divided by the modern world. The mission was established 300 years ago to service their needs, and continues to do so. Many, but not all, of the O’odham are Catholic, and their lives, like that of many Native Americans have been fraught with difficulty to this day. It’s the same sad story with a post-9/11 twist.

Before the Europeans arrived the O’odham claimed as their traditional homeland the Papagueria, a vast, Southwestern land mass that stretched east from the Gulf of Mexico to the San Pedro River, and north from Sonora, Mexico, to Central Arizona. The Gadsden Purchase of 1854 chopped that in half with establishment of the US/Mexico border. Mexico rounded up their O’odham and forced them onto reservations. Under pressure from settlers, mining interests and the railroads, the O’odham’s traditional lands in America shrank appreciably. Still one people, the O’odham could traverse the border relatively unhindered for many generations, and for a long time many didn’t even know a border existed.

But that changed when the Twin Towers came crashing down (a point evidently lost on the drug cartels, human coyotes, and the undocumented). Legal cross-border movement, the O’odham claim, is greatly restricted under tighter immigration laws, which is understandable given the current geopolitical climate. The old days are a thing of the past for the O’odham. No more can they wander freely across their old hunting grounds, collecting food and materials essential to their religion, economy and culture. No more can they visit sacred sites and family members at will without checking in with the man. It has been reported that overzealous border officials routinely confiscate pine leaves, sweet grass and common bird feathers used in their religion and culture, which if true is downright silly. And like the rest of us, the O’odham must now present border identification cards and passports when entering the USA.

The White Dove of the Desert has had a difficult life, but she’s a tough old bird, surviving nature’s wrath with dignity like that large earthquake in 1887, and a lightning strike on the West Tower in 1939. But some of the most pernicious damage, from which it continues to reel, was man-caused. Years ago the building’s exterior was coated in cement plaster, a big mistake, because it prevented the original material from breathing, trapping moisture beneath which contributed to architectural degradation and decay to the historic brick and adobe infrastructure, and interior art work.

Like wearing rubber boots during a long, hot summer, wear them long enough and you’ll end up with foot rot. Great effort has been made to strip that original cement coating and replace it with blistering-white lime plaster, allowing those smelly old feet to finally breath. Walls have been rebuilt. Brick replaced. The weak made strong. Pictures made pretty again. The results are remarkable, the restoration work, inside and out, fantastic. To all who contribute financially, or in deed, to restoring the White Dove to its proper stature for generations to come, we thank you.",http://canadafreepress.com/print_friendly/mission-san-xavier-del-bac-tucson-arizona,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

If the Trump Administration can be rolled that easily, it's going to be awfully tough to make American great again

Uh oh: Trump reverses course on offshore drilling, exempts Florida



The problem here isn’t that you can’t make a case drilling elsewhere. And you can make a legitimate argument that some locations should be prioritized over others, for various reasons that could very well include tourism. As you go about deciding where to approve leases, things like that are perfectly fair considerations. But it’s a long way from that to what just happened: Last week, the Trump Administration announced that it will lift the ban on offshore drilling in virtually all U.S. waters. Then Florida politicians from both parties freaked. Less than a week later, the Trump EPA says there will be no drilling off the shore of Florida.

Wow. That was easy. Too easy: The Trump administration last week proposed opening nearly all U.S. offshore waters to oil and gas drilling, a move aimed at boosting domestic energy production and which sparked protests from coastal states, environmentalists and the tourism industry. The administration’s decision on Tuesday removes from consideration a portion of the eastern Gulf of Mexico, an area that oil drillers have said they are interested in exploring – but not all of it. Florida state waters extend 3 nautical miles from the shore on the Atlantic, and 9 nautical miles on the Gulf side, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Scott last week announced his opposition to the drilling plan and said he had asked to meet with Zinke. Zinke’s decision to exempt Florida from offshore drilling leaves the door open for other governors opposed to offshore oil and gas development to seek a similar prohibition for their states. Oceana, an environmental lobby group, said it was pleased that Zinke had removed Florida from areas open to drilling. “Such a quick reversal begs the question: Will the Trump administration give equal consideration to all the other coastal Governors from both parties who overwhelmingly reject this radical offshore drilling plan?” Oceana campaign director Diane Hoskins said in a statement.

The message this sends, loud and clear, is that the Trump Administration can be rolled by parochial concerns if they scream loudly enough. Republican Gov. Rick Scott was joined by Republican Senator Marco Rubio and Democrat Senator Bill Nelson in demanding Florida’s exemption from the drilling plans. It doesn’t mean there can’t be any drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, but it can’t go on within three miles of the Florida coastline, which could conceivably put a lot of oil reserves off limits. So why shouldn’t every other east coast state put on a similar offensive? Why shouldn’t California? Why shouldn’t Alaska? And if Trump tells them no after telling Florida yes, what is the rationale for that? Because Florida’s tourism concerns are more important than California’s? Or any other state with its particular objections? Everyone can give you a reason that their own backyard simply can’t be the place for drilling, or development, or infrastructure, or whatever. If parochial interests always ruled then we would never do anything. I’m not saying Florida’s concerns shouldn’t be heard, but to cave to them this quickly signals to everyone that political pressure based on parochial concerns will yield results. If the Trump Administration can be rolled that easily, it’s going to be awfully tough to make American great again.

Seven “When-Then” Signs of Biblical End-Times Marked 2015

1. A rare solar eclipse on the equinox followed by

2. A blood moon on Passover. “The sun shall be darkened and the moon turned to blood before [paniym, facing] the day of the Lord.” Joel 2:31.

3. The Iran Nuclear Treaty signed by 7 nations. “When they say ‘Peace & safety,’ sudden destruction comes. 1Thess 52,3.

4. The re-definition of marriage by the US Supreme Court to include homosexuality, forbidden in biblical law, “lest the land vomit you out,” Leviticus 18:22-25

5. The JADE HELM drill [Homeland Eradication of Local Militants] “When you see the abomination standing where it ought not…” Mark 13:14. Early believers understand Christ’s warning to be the Roman army in 66 AD, fled Jerusalem.

6. Rome was also “standing where it ought not” as the pope appealed to US Congress for his agenda, closure of business on Sunday to save greenhouse gases [so everyone could have the benefit of the eucharist [Laudato Si', par. 237 online].

7. Papal visit to the United Nations: “Great words” of the horn in Daniel 7 is the context of the judgment, verses 8-11. Daniel 7 represents the kingdoms of the world as fierce beasts of prey. The Protestant reformers all saw the papacy as the “little horn” growing out of the 4th beast, Rome, fitting verse 25.

The ‘ peace and safety ‘ sign was repeated on the International Day of Peace, September 21, 2017 with the theme for the year, “ Peace , Respect, Safety and Dignity for All.” Two days later, “the Great Sign of Revelation 12” was in the sky—a never-before convergence of constellations and planets. The sun was in Virgo with a crown of 12 stars (Leo has nine plus three planets) and the moon in the belly area exited between her feet after nine months.

“Rapturists” pounced on the sign as for a rapture, another example of the wedding parables being misunderstood by the fictional “Left Behind” series. Dr. Richard Ruhling, author on current events and Bible prophecy, says God doesn’t put the “Bridge Out” sign on the bridge—He puts it before we get there. The sign with nine-months of ‘pregnancy’ points to this spring and confirmation of it will be the destruction of Jerusalem seen in Zechariah 14…

“The day of the Lord comes [signaled also by #1-3 in texts above]…all nations gathered against Jerusalem to battle.” Most Christians think this was fulfilled in 70 AD, but Matthew 22 shows it as part of a wedding parable and there was no wedding in 70 AD according to Ruhling who explains…

God executed judgment on Egypt [Exod 12:12] and took Israel to a covenant by which they became His kingdom [Exod 19:5,6 and Bride, Jer 3:14. Paul included the Exodus in “all those things happened for our examples…ends of the world.” 1Cor 10:1,1l. This offers a different meaning ot the wedding parables.

When the disciples asked if Christ would restore the kingdom to Israel in Acts 1, He replied, “It is not for you to know the times and seasons .” Paul explains, “Of the times and seasons …the day of the Lord comes as a thief, when they shall say ‘Peace and safety,’ sudden destruction comes as travail on a woman with child.” 1Thess 5:2,3.

“Travail on a woman with child” fits the 9-month pregnancy of the Great Sign and reminds us that Egypt travailed as Israel became God’s “first-born” in Exodus 4:22. But first-born implies another event and Revelation 15 offers insight to 144,000 who sign the song of Moses—a song of their experience like Moses.

God used Moses to bring Judgment to Egypt and He will use an anointed group of 144,000 that are said to be virgins–not male Jews living in Israel, but the wise virgins of Matthew 25 that get into the marriage—a covenant relationship in which God will take down the kingdoms of this world as seen in Daniel 2–

“In the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a king…it shall break in pieces all these other kingdoms” verse 44,45. A parallel passage is Isaiah 41:14,15. This is not about guns—it’s about the Word of God that Moses was citing. Anyone can confirm this by looking up the texts to the world’s #1 best-seller. Those who don’t read it have no advantage of those who can’t read.

Davos globalists experience what they engineered

As globalist billionaires and politicians gather for the World Economic Forum in Davos Switzerland, they are encouraged to take forty-five minutes out of their busy schedule to “walk in the shoes” of a refugee. As much as benevolent organizations tout this as an opportunity to share the heartache of a refugee’s experience, it is more an exercise in hubris than compassion. Consider that it is the unchecked avarice of most of the participants that has created the circumstances upending lives and displacing populations. These economic movers and shakers’ vision of a global community is one that allows them free access to sack nations for their own profit. The global regime that WEF participants peddle and carry out is the very avenue by which average citizens are placed at risk of losing their homes, their livelihoods and their countries to strife and civil war.

Thoughts on the Solar Tariffs The Trump Administration has enacted tariffs on imported solar cells and larger modules (as well as on washing machines). In general, tariffs are counterproductive, because they only help some producers at the expense of others, and they unambiguously raise prices for consumers. That logic applies to this case as well. However, insofar as the American solar companies that import cells and modules are some of the biggest losers in this deal, they have little grounds for complaint, as they are already receiving lavish benefits from provisions in the tax code. Two wrongs don’t make a right, to be sure, but employment in the renewables sector is arguably closer to the “natural” level after this latest move by the federal government.

Ivanka gave women some questionable advice for dealing with sexual harassment in her 2009 book, The Trump Card: Playing to Win in Business and in Life: “Learn to figure out when a hoot or a holler is indeed a form of harassment and when it’s merely a good-natured tease that you can give back in kind.”

Sounds like common sense to me. But then, I'm not a woman and don't get harassed. I'm sure some women are very uncomfortable having their sexiness and good looks commented on like that. I'm also sure that others enjoy the attention.

If anyone in America has suspicions that communism, in the more friendly, yet more deviously illegal, form called Socialism is commandeering our civil rights, in fact, ALL of our rights, he or she is absolutely spot on target. Without a miniscule of legislation put forth by our law-making branch of government, the Legislative Branch AKA Congress, we are being trussed like slaves and unjustly pilloried from the most unlikely of places, the Judiciary Branch of our very own government; the Branch that is supposed to rule on correctness of application, but is currently failing miserably and illegally and uncaringly as judges announce legislation from the bench without holding the powers to do so.

Why is it that just after good news settles in and the future looks better and better, some soft-head narcissist, like the most prominent one today, our feckless POTUS of usurper fame Barack Hussein Obama, starts feeling his oats and begins acting just like a jackass? And I mean that last word both in real life and in politics.

Black people in America, though certainly not all of them but a significant percentage, are seemingly forever active in areas of self-flagellation which is defined by some people as “the act of hitting oneself with a whip”; or other forms of punishment, even if only in the form of mental cruelty.

It seems as though the one thing that should have killed Obama’s latest Amnesty Plan should also have killed anything else he has concocted in six usurped years in the office of POTUS is his never-yet-proven legitimacy to actually hold that office. It is obvious by now that Americans have given up on proving that Barack Hussein Obama has usurped the highest governmental office in the United States and nobody seems to give a DAMN!

WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama on Friday strongly condemned the “brutal murder” of a British hostage by the Islamic State group.

“Standing together with our U.K. friends and allies, we will work to bring the perpetrators of Alan’s murder - as well as the murders of Jim Foley, Steven Sotloff and David Haines - to justice,” Obama said.

The German philosopher Emmanuel Kant said, “Language and religion are the two great dividers.”

CNS News reported this week: 44.6 percent of people living in California don’t speak English at home. In Texas, 35.6 percent; in New Mexico, 34.5 percent; in New Jersey, 32 percent and 31 percent in New York.

Today, in New York City, with nearly 40 percent foreign-born immigrants, that city boasts 800 different languages being spoken instead of English. In Denver Public Schools, teachers must teach to 173 different languages via endless immigration from around the world. In California, voting ballots feature 20 different languages to deal with millions of immigrants that cannot speak or write in English. (Source: Denver Post, “173 Languages in Denver Schools”)

Note this reality: a language creates a person’s worldview. Different languages create different worldviews. Multiple worldviews create fracturing and fragmentation in societies, in countries and in all organized systems.

Former Colorado Governor Richard D. Lamm said, “A nation is much more. It is a state of mind, a shared vision, and a recognition that we are all in this together. A nation needs a common language as it needs a common currency.”

A person who speaks multiple languages enriches him or herself in linguistic skills that must be appreciated. A country that boasts multiple languages cannot survive the linguistic chaos created when people cannot and do not understand one another.

Today, you must press “1” for English, “2” for Spanish, “3” for Chinese and “4” for Arabic in cities dominated by immigrants around the United States. Entire cities in southern California speak only Chinese. Others speak only Spanish. Place like Detroit, Michigan, only Arabic scribbling dominates storefronts and phone answering services come only in Arabic. Additionally, in Moslem dominated areas of Miami, New York City, Detroit and Minneapolis—Arabic dominates the schools and you will not see any “Stars and Stripes” featured in homes, schools or storefronts.

(Source: I visited these cities this year)

If the United States Congress continues the current immigration onslaught of over 1.2 million immigrants annually to total over 100,000,000 (million) legal immigrants by 2045, English will not be the majority language within 30 years. Spanish speakers expect to become the majority ethnic group by 2042. That figure of 100 million immigrants includes their birth rates of 900,000 annually, chain-migrated relatives at 9 per immigrant and 50,000 diversity visas granted annually, along with 250,000 work visas. That figure does not include the estimated 500,000 illegal alien migrants crossing U.S. borders and visas overstays. (Source: www.cis.org, Dr. Steve Camarota, “Illegal immigration numbers”)

The historian Seymour Martin Lipset said, “The histories of bilingual and bicultural societies that do not assimilate are histories of turmoil, tension and tragedy. Canada, Belgium, Malaysia, and Lebanon all face crises of national existence in which minorities press for autonomy, if not independence.” Pakistan and Cyprus follow division. France, Germany, Sweden, Norway, United Kingdom, Holland, Italy and Denmark face fragmentation via immigrant colonies with different languages, worldviews and cultures—that refuse to assimilate into the host countries.

Lamm continued, “You have to share something with your neighbors besides a zip code. We need many things to tie us together, but one indispensible element must be that we all speak one common language. America has been successful because we have become one people. There is a social glue of a common language, a shared history, uniting symbols that tie us together. We live under a common flag, which we honor and salute.”

Since Lamm’s speech 15 years ago, America has become everybody else’s country. It can only fragment further with more and more people with different worldviews and languages.

Today, Colin Kaepernick created a wave of disrespect for his and our country that grows by the day. Black Lives Matter demands that their followers kill cops as well as create a separate African state. The Latina group “La Rasa” features racism as its driving force and stands to push Spanish as the single greatest language in the United States. The Muslim Brotherhood and CAIR expect to push Sharia Law into the mainstream of every Moslem dominated area of America.

Today’s massive and relentless immigration cannot sustain this civilization with a single vision. Millions of immigrants with opposing languages cannot gather on the same page with the same vision for America. Millions of immigrants with incompatible cultures and religions—fracture the foundation of the ‘melting pot’ metaphor into the ‘broken glass’ metaphor.

No nation on Earth has survived the ravages of time. No nation has survived multiple languages and cultures. If America hopes to survive even to 2050 with the current projection of 100 million people from 196 different countries from around the world; English must be expected, demanded and taught across the land as the ONLY language of print, voice and official papers.

We must rescind E.O. 13166 by President Bill Clinton that costs taxpayers billions of dollars to offer every immigrant his or her papers in his or her language. We must curtail all TV and radio programs in foreign languages in favor of English.

“Immigrants devoted to their own cultures and religions are not influenced by the secular politically correct façade that dominates academia, news-media, entertainment, education, religious and political thinking today,” said James Walsh, former Associate General Counsel of the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service. “They claim the right not to assimilate, and the day is coming when the question will be how can the United States regulate the defiantly unassimilated cultures, religions and mores of foreign lands? Such immigrants say their traditions trump the U.S. legal system. Balkanization of the United States has begun.” Speech given by James Walsh in 1991

9198,10396,Bannon Subpoenaed By Mueller In Russia Probe,"Bannon Subpoenaed By Mueller In Russia Probe

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

The bad news for Steve Bannon just keeps on coming.

Not long after Bannon was bounced from Breitbart following his feud with Trump over his comments in Michael Wolff’s book, moments ago the NYT reports that Trump’s former chief strategist was subpoenaed last week by the special counsel, Robert Mueller to testify before a grand jury as part of the investigation into possible links between Trump’s associates and Russia.

And the reason why stocks dipped modestly and the VIX bounced on the news, is that the subpoena marks the first time Mueller is known to have used a grand jury subpoena to seek information from a member of Mr. Trump’s inner circle.

After excerpts from the book, “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,” were published this month, Mr. Trump derided Mr. Bannon publicly and threatened to sue him for defamation. Mr. Bannon was soon ousted as the executive chairman of the hard-right website Breitbart News.

Mueller reportedly issued the subpoena after Mr. Bannon was quoted in a new book criticizing Mr. Trump, saying that Donald Trump Jr.’s 2016 meeting with Russians was “treasonous” and predicting that the special counsel investigation would ultimately center on money laundering.

According to the NYT, the subpoena could be a negotiating tactic:

Mr. Mueller is likely to allow Mr. Bannon to forgo the grand jury appearance if he agrees to instead be questioned by investigators in the less formal setting of the special counsel’s offices in Washington, according to the person, who would not be named discussing the case. But it was not clear why Mr. Mueller treated Mr. Bannon differently than the dozen administration officials who were interviewed in the final months of last year and were never served with a subpoena.

Meanwhile, on Tuesday Bannon was testifying behind closed doors before the House Intelligence Committee, which is also investigating Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election and ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.

The NYT quotes legal experts who said the subpoena could be a sign that the investigation was intensifying, while others said it may simply have been a negotiating tactic to persuade Mr. Bannon to cooperate with the investigation. The experts also said it could be a signal to Mr. Bannon, who has tried to publicly patch up his falling-out with the president, that despite Mr. Trump’s legal threats, Mr. Bannon must be completely forthcoming with investigators.

Prosecutors generally prefer to interview witnesses before a grand jury when they believe they have information that the witnesses do not know or when they think they might catch the witnesses in a lie. It is much easier for a witness to stop the questioning or sidestep questions in an interview than during grand jury testimony, which is transcribed, and witnesses are required to answer every question.

The news will hardly come as a surprise to Trump: “the president appeared to ease his anger toward Mr. Bannon at the end of last week. When asked in an interview with The Wall Street Journal whether his break with Mr. Bannon was “permanent,” the president replied, “I don’t know what the word ‘permanent’ means.””

As a result, “people close to Mr. Bannon took the president’s comments as a signal that Mr. Trump was aware that his fired strategist would soon be contacted by investigators.”

Whether or not Bannon actually knows something that can help the Mueller probe, of course, remains to be seen.

Despite a modest blip lower in risk, stocks have promptly BTFD on the news and for now appear unbothered by this latest development involving the Trump probe.

Iran's citizens have paid a very high price for the regime's nuclear ambitions and search for regional influence

Will the Protests in Iran Affect the Regime’s Priorities?



During the recent waves of protests in Iran, much criticism was voiced against the country’s involvement in regional conflicts, particularly given the difficult economic situation within Iran itself. Demonstrators called for resources to be diverted from overseas to benefit the Iranian population. The large protests have since declined, but there are still some semblances of protest, indicating the resistance among portions of the public to continue sustaining the economic hardships. This article discusses the implications of the economic situation for the Iranian regime’s national priorities, including its support for elements engaged in undermining regional stability in the Middle East.

Situation Report On January 3, 2018, after six days of rioting that took the lives of more than twenty people, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, Muhammad Ali Jafari, announced “the end of the current revolt.” The wave of protests has indeed ebbed, but there are still signs of protest in various locations throughout the country, expressed in part by religious and government buildings being set on fire and strikes in important sectors, including oil and the steel industry, where salaries have not been paid for a number of months. The protests broke out due to the economic distress, shown by high unemployment, price increases of dozens of percent for essential goods, low salaries, and long delays in salary payments. This background contrasts with the relatively positive macro data. In addition, there has been a sharp increase in imports of luxury goods that benefit parts of the population, particularly those close to the regime. Just two weeks before the riots began, Iran hosted a delegation from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF’s views are important to Iran for its integration into the global economy, its ability to raise capital, and foreign investment. Following the visit, the IMF issued a fairly optimistic announcement regarding economic growth in Iran, noting that growth had begun to spread to sectors outside oil. The IMF also expected that Iran would approve the rise in fuel prices (in order to limit the subsidies) – a move that would raise prices in the economy even more. However, the IMF announcement includes recommendations that involve structural and cultural changes, which the regime is not keen to introduce. For example, the IMF asked Iran to enhance its efforts to develop the private sector, and reform state-owned enterprises and improve transparency about corporate beneficial ownership. The Iranian regime is known to base its strength on holding and operating hundreds of state-owned enterprises and on indirect control of many companies identified with the security forces. The IMF asked Tehran to accelerate the reform in its financial system (including steps to prevent money laundering) and to extend its collection of taxes. It also recommended more employment of women, by restricting legal and social obstacles and pay gaps, subsidizing child care for low paid women, and creating work opportunities for women.

In recent years, notwithstanding economic distress, the Iranian regime has spent billions of dollars funding its ambitions to extend Iranian influence in the Middle East. In a speech on January 3, 2018, IDF Chief of Staff Gadi Eisenkot noted that in recent months Iranian investment in the Palestinian arena has increased due to Tehran’s drive to gain influence there. Iranian aid to Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza has increased to $100 million, and elsewhere in the region, elements receiving Iranian funding or aid include Iranian forces in Iraq and Syria, Hezbollah, Shiite militias in Syria, the Syrian military, Houthi rebels in Yemen, and various associations engaged in subversion in several countries in the Middle East. On August 13, 2017, the Iranian parliament approved an increase in the Revolutionary Guards’ budget for actions outside the Iranian borders, and the budget for ballistic missiles. These expenses compound the major damage sustained by the Iranian economy in 2012-2015, during the period of severe sanctions imposed on oil exports and the banking system due to the nuclear project. (According to an estimate from the US Treasury Department in July 2015, the loss in revenues in the oil industry alone exceeded $160 billion.) Will the Protests Affect the Regime’s Priorities? The wave of protests could show the Iranian regime that the most sensitive period in terms of internal stability is not necessarily the height of an economic recession, but rather the period of reforms intended as a way out of it. The expectations of the Iranian public for economic benefit rose following the lifting of sanctions on oil production and the banking system two years ago, which led to the considerable improvement in macro data, stemming from a sharp rise in revenues from the export of oil and the start of improvement in the non-oil sector. In addition, as noted by the IMF, the trend is for growth of about 4.2 percent annually (3 percent per capita). However, improvements at the macro level have yet to trickle down to the micro level (the economic situation in the street), and the adjustment will in any case be a long and complex process.

Continued below... Against this background, it is possible to imagine the next moves by the Iranian regime using two equations. The first concerns the division of resources between present and future, that is, between current expenses and investments, including reforms (that affect the future). The second equation is the division of current expenses between domestic and foreign expenses. An important factor is what resources will be available to Iran. This depends inter alia on energy prices, which are hard to forecast, and foreign investment in Iran, which depends in part on foreign relations and the extent to which investors are worried about the reinstatement of sanctions. Clearly, the greater the resources, the less of the impact caused by economic constraints, even if priorities change. In the division of resources between present and future, within the next year at least, Iran will probably increase its resources for civilian consumption, even at the expense of investments and implementation of reforms recommended by the IMF intended to bear fruit in the future. Perhaps the first signs of this can be identified in reports of the government’s decision to postpone the plan to increase fuel prices at this stage and to reduce allowances, as was planned for the next financial year (which begins on March 21, 2018). At the same time, the regime is expected to increase its efforts to raise capital abroad for investments. As to the division of resources between domestic and foreign uses, while the objectives outside Iran are very important for the regime, presumably priority will be given to the welfare of the local population, at least until the economic situation at the micro level improves; this is in view of the increased risks to internal stability. This also depends on the level of unrest in the Iranian street and how seriously it is seen by the leadership. The economic constraint could therefore find expression in the resources allocated by Iran to realize its Middle East ambitions, as it prioritizes its regional objectives. Expenses on overseas activity could also arouse disputes between different parties in the regime. However, since the goal of establishing Iran as a regional power is a strategic objective for the regime, it is doubtful whether Iran will make a significant change in its foreign involvement policy. In addition, if it encounters a security challenge, the economic constraint would probably not obstruct the military activity. As for the nuclear project, the regime will probably be very cautious while complying with the JCPOA, or at least refrain from risking the exposure of breaches on its part, particularly in view of President Trump’s negative view of the agreement. So far Iran’s citizens have paid a very high price for the regime’s nuclear ambitions and search for regional influence (these two are closely related in the Iranian concept of security, which makes nuclear power in Iranian hands even more dangerous). While the regime is determined to achieve its overseas objectives, it can be assumed that within the coming year at least, the emphasis could well be placed on the internal arena, while restricting expenses intended for overseas activity, including areas affecting Israel’s security. In the long term, Iran’s basic economic features are relatively good, so that successful management of the economy is the factor that will determine whether the economic constraint will be reduced – which will reduce the impact of Iran’s foreign and security strategy – or increased, thus serving as the basis for internal instability and further waves of protest.

2844,3259,Judge Sentences USA Gymnast Doctor Larry Nassar to 40-175 Years,"Victims and others look on as Rachael Denhollander speaks at the sentencing hearing for Larry Nassar, a former team USA Gymnastics doctor who pleaded guilty in November 2017 to sexual assault charges, in Lansing, Michigan. ( REUTERS/Brendan McDermid )

Join us on our podcast each weekday for an interesting story, well told, from Charisma News. Listen at charismapodcastnetwork.com.

As his victims wept in a Michigan courtroom on Wednesday, disgraced long-time USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar was sentenced to up to 175 years in prison for abusing young female gymnasts who were entrusted to his care.

""I've signed your death warrant,"" Ingham County Circuit Court Judge Rosemarie Aquilina told Nassar, following days of harrowing accounts from about 160 of his victims.

""It is my privilege—on counts 1, 2, 5, 8, 10 and 18 and 24—to sentence you to 40 years,"" Aquilina said. ""I'm going to look at my cheat sheet: 40 years, just so you know and you can count it off your calendar, is 480 months. The tail end—because I need to send a message to the parole board in the event somehow God is gracious and I know He is—and you survive the 60 years in federal court first and then you start on my 40 years. You've gone off the page here as to what I'm doing. My page only goes to 100 years. Sir, I'm giving you 175 years, which is 2100 months.""

Spectators and victims cried, applauded and embraced as Nassar, 54, wearing a dark blue jailhouse jumpsuit, was led out of the courtroom. Rachael Denhollander, the first woman to publicly accuse him in 2016, shared a hug with Angela Povilaitis, the lead prosecutor.

Nassar, who served as the program's physician through four Olympic Games, had apologized to his victims during the hearing, telling them, ""I will carry your words with me for the rest of my days.""

But Aquilina dismissed his statement as insincere and courtroom spectators gasped as the judge read aloud from a letter he wrote to her claiming he was a good doctor who was manipulated into pleading guilty.

Nassar, who already is serving a 60-year sentence in federal prison for child pornography convictions, also said his accusers fabricated claims to gain money and fame and wrote, ""Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.""

""Would you like to withdraw your plea?"" Aquilina asked Nassar after tossing aside his letter with evident disgust.

""No, your honor,"" Nassar said.

""Because you are guilty, aren't you? Are you guilty, sir?"" the judge demanded.

After a long pause, Nassar said quietly, ""I have said my plea, exactly.""

Changing View

Both the prosecution and Aquilina emphasized the broader significance of the sentencing, coming amid a national debate over sexual misconduct and abuse prompted by scandals involving powerful men from Hollywood to Washington.

Povilaitis said the conclusion of Nassar's case takes the victims' shame and puts it ""where it belongs, right on him.""

""At this particular moment in history, this sentence and hearing will be viewed as a turning point in how our community, our state, our nation, our culture looks at sexual abuse,"" she said.

Aquilina rattled off a series of disturbing statistics about the prevalence of sexual abuse before saying, ""It stops now.""

The sentencing followed an extraordinary weeklong hearing that saw a parade of Nassar victims tell their stories in raw and unflinching terms, describing how he used medical treatments as a cover to justify penetrating their bodies with his fingers.

Although Nassar only admitted to seven instances of abuse in the case, Aquilina allowed other victims to speak at his sentencing. Throughout much of the proceedings, the bespectacled Nassar sat with his head bowed, rarely making eye contact with his victims.

His accusers ranged from famous Olympic gold medalists like Aly Raisman to women like Denhollander, who was the last of the victims to speak on Wednesday and whom Aquilina described as ""the bravest person I have ever had in my courtroom."" The accusers had testified Nassar won their trust with kind words and by giving them snacks forbidden by their coaches. Testimony came McKayla Maroney, a gold medalist at the 2012 London Olympics, who called Nassar a ""monster human being"" and a former member of the U.S. national team who said his abuse led to depression and an eating disorder.

Another gymnast said she was only 6 years old when Nassar began molesting. She blamed Nassar for her father's suicide once the man realized his daughter had not been lying about the abuse she endured.

""I've been forever changed by all of this and I will never feel small again,"" said Bailey Lorencen, who was an anonymous accuser until she spoke in court this week. ""I have a different confidence in myself as a woman.""

Institutions Questioned

In addition to his work with Olympic teams, Nassar also was the team physician for the Michigan State University gymnastics and women's crew teams, as well as an associate professor at MSU's College of Osteopathic Medicine.

The National Collegiate Athletic Association said on Tuesday it had opened an investigation into Michigan State's handling of the case. In her statement on Wednesday, Denhollander, criticized the school for failing to adequately investigate complaints against Nassar dating back years.

In addition to Raisman, Olympic gold medalists Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and McKayla Maroney have gone public in recent months, saying they were assaulted by Nassar while undergoing treatment.

Victims and others have criticized USA Gymnastics, the sport's governing body in the United States, for ignoring their complaints and have accused the federation of suppressing their accounts in a bid to avoid bad publicity.

On Monday, three top board members resigned in the wake of the scandal, following the exit last March of the federation's president and chief executive.

In a statement on Wednesday, Kerry Perry, who became USA Gymnastics president in December, applauded the sentence and vowed to ""create a culture that empowers and supports"" the program's athletes.

Several companies have announced they would not continue to sponsor the federation, including AT&T Inc on Tuesday.

Nassar pleaded guilty in November to seven counts of first-degree sex assault in Ingham County, as well as three additional charges in Eaton County, where he will be sentenced next week.

6146,7024,Liberals’ Sudden Concern About Bill Clinton’s Behavior Is Cynical: New at Reason,"The dynamics that led to Democrats protecting Bill Clinton from accusations of sexual assault and rape haven’t changed.

David Harsanyi writes:

A number of notable liberals have recently decided to start taking allegations of sexual assault against former President Bill Clinton seriously. Let’s just say that discarding the Clintons when they’re no longer politically useful in order to retroactively grab the higher moral ground isn’t exactly an act of heroism. But if we’re going to relitigate history, let’s get it right.

In The New York Times, for example, Michelle Goldberg spends around 75 percent of her column titled “I Believe Juanita” rationalizing why it was OK not to believe Juanita Broaddrick, who credibly accused Bill Clinton of rape decades ago. You won’t be surprised to learn that Goldberg claims the politics and conspiracymongering of conservatives provoked skepticism among liberals—excuses that will be awfully familiar to anyone following the justification of Republican Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore’s supporters.",http://beforeitsnews.com/tea-party/2017/11/liberals-sudden-concern-about-bill-clintons-behavior-is-cynical-new-at-reason-2602547.html,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
418,486,"21-Year-Old Spends Life Savings Of $25,000 To Turn Herself Into A Porcelain Doll (video)","We’ve heard of women who try their darndest to look like Barbie Dolls. Some have been known to go to the extent of having major surgeries to alter their bodies in a way that will get them closer to the physical features of the tall, blonde doll with a tiny waist and curvy bust and hips. But there is another woman who is just as dedicated to her look just as much as all the Barbie Doll lovers out there. Her name is Jade Smith and she is on a mission to look exactly like a porcelain doll.

Proving that she will spare no expense, Jade has already spent £18,000 to get her on the way to looking like the real life “Lolita.”

Her doll-like outfits alone have cost her £10,000 and they consist of items such as a frilly pink dress with knee-high socks and a furry pink headband that wraps around her hair. Lolita’s hair is platinum blonde and she has a set of full eyelashes which are another costly thing that needs to be maintained in order to keep up with the appearance.

Jade has set certain budgets aside for monthly spending to stay on track with her appearance. For example, she has a £20 glitter budget. Evidently, Lolita has some sparkly attire.

She has gone so far as to wear contact lenses that aren’t needed. She wears them so that they expand the shape of her eyes, making her look even more like Lolita. At times, she gets up at 4 am to get ready and make sure she has her look perfected.

Seems like a lot of work and money to keep up with trying to look like someone else, but Jade is truly obsessed.

“I’ve spent around £10,000 just on my clothes,” said Jade. “I normally get my clothing shipped in from Japan and Korea.”

The clothes and makeup aren’t the only things that Jade needs to look like Lolita, though. She has loads of accessories that go along with the character.

“I have roughly around 40 pairs of shoes and I have around 40 key chains. The money has also gone into my toy collection.”

You would never guess that Jade is an adult if you walked into her room. She has a Care-bear lined bed and shelves that house dolls, Disney characters, Hello Kitty and My Little Pony figurines. The room is covered in pink, looking much more like a little girl’s than a grown adults.

Jade, who lives in her parent’s home in a loft, gets a grief from her family occasionally.

“My family calls me a hoarder and they really wish I would downsize and become more minimalistic,” said Jade. “They wish I would wear something a bit normal but they just accept me for who I am now.”

Jade admits that she would wear head to toe pink every day but her retail assistant job keeps her from doing so. Instead, she has to accessorize with pink and wear mostly black when she is on the job.

“I got in trouble once at work for dressing differently. I have over 20 keychains on my phone and my phone fell out of my pocket during a shift. The only casual clothing I own is jeggings, which I wear for work,” she said.

In the future, Jade plans on taking it up a notch and going for surgery to get her even closer to the “Lolita Look.”",http://awm.com/21-year-old-spends-life-savings-of-25000-to-turn-herself-into-a-porcelain-doll-video/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

Sibel Edmunds, a former FBI contractor fired for revealing government misconduct, says she has multiple sources within the bureau willing to expose special prosecutor Robert Mueller as a deep state shill.

In an interview with Infowars, Edmunds claimed that several agents have called Mueller out in the past for failing to properly investigate terrorists while at the FBI.

“Imagine my shock when I saw that Robert Mueller was appointed as the special counsel in this case, the same Robert Mueller, who in my case, put gag orders together with attorney general Ashcroft,” Edmonds noted.

“There were FBI agents, not only in the Washington field office, but also in the Chicago and Patterson field offices, who were blowing the whistle on Mueller internally, saying hes squashing our investigations [into terror networks].”

Because of his failings as FBI director, Edmund’s says Mueller has no authority to run the Russia collusion investigation against President Donald Trump.

“I know of several veteran, highly decorated FBI agents, if subpoenaed, would testify that how Robert Mueller, due to what he was doing as the director of the FBI, can not preside as the special counsel in this case,” Edmonds continued.

“Its a slam dunk case, its documented.”

In a separate video for her own website, Newsbud, Edmund’s outlined her indictment of Mueller.

WARNING: This article contains graphic descriptions and photos of Muslim animal cruelty.

10 NEWS This is how a women working with the Danish Animal Protection describes some of the horrible treatment of animals in the Muslim dominated area of Vollsmose, a suburb of Odense, the third largest city in Denmark.

“I’ve seen cats being played football with. I have seen cats with their legs torn off and their eyes gouged out. We see cats that have had their heads torn off, and ones that had skin ripped away, or had their legs and back broken.”

“The worst thing I saw was a bunch of kittens crawling around with their bowels hanging out because they had their bellies cut open,” she says.

Therese. S. Wilbert, Director of the Danish Cat Protection agrees that the area is unsafe, especially for cats:

“In Vollsmose, the degree of abuse for cats is worse than elsewhere in Denmark. It is usually children below ten years of age who abuse the animals,” she says. Wilbert says that in 2016 alone Cat Protection received 20-25 reports about animal abuse in Vollsmose, “but many cases are not reported, so the amount of animal cruelty is probably far greater.”

The young men stopped the animal ambulance, opened the ambulance door, stole the ignition key, tore at the woman’s hair and shouted in her face. The car’s taillight was smashed and the car was bumped .” The woman had to leave the cat and flee for her own safety.

Timing is everything…

Is it not peculiar that with ALL that is happening in the world, with North and South Korea and the Middle East, and other MAJOR events, we are finding out about this NOW? There seems to be a barrage of scandals and stories that fill the media lately, including those revolving around the Government.



Source

The recent news that surfaced has GOP lawmakers “concerned” with a couple of FBI texts that reveal a “secret society” that was sent directly after President Trump won the Presidency. According to The Hill:

“The day after the election … there is a text exchange between these two FBI agents, these supposed to be fact-centric FBI agents saying, ‘Perhaps this is the first meeting of the secret society,’ Gowdy said on Fox News’s ‘The Story with Martha MacCallum.’”



Source

Fox News stated there were over 50,000 text messages between an FBI agent Peter Strzok, and a lawyer for the FBI Lisa Page. The two were also found to be “romantically involved.” This also isn’t the first time Strzok’s messages have come under fire. He also was in question when he had a message stating something about taking an “insurance policy” out for if Trump won the Presidency. Not only that but with recent developments, it seems a number of texts have gone mysteriously “missing.” Fox News stated:

“The developments come as the DOJ announced that the FBI ‘failed to preserve’ five months of texts between Strzok and Page.

‘We will leave no stone unturned to confirm with certainty why these text messages are not now available to be produced and will use every technology available to determine whether the missing messages are recoverable from another source,’ Sessions said in a statement provided to Fox News. ‘If we are successful, we will update the congressional committees immediately.’

The missing messages from Strzok and Page span a crucial window, between the presidential transition and the launch of Mueller’s Russia probe. Strzok was removed from the probe by Mueller after he learned of the messages.”

There seems to be a lot more to this story, but it is coming to the light as we speak! There should also be no surprise that the Clinton’s and their Foundation have had some crooked activity for over a decade and that their involvement played part in all of this. Sadly, it doesn’t seem she will ever be charged with her heinous activities…

There will be a lot more revealed very soon, but as I watched Jacob Israel’s YouTube Channel and his video below today, it just reminded me that this is all to fuel more hatred and division among everyone. Don’t let it do that to you, don’t let the media get the best of you and trigger your emotions. It’s exactly what they are designed to do, and that is why I recently wrote about that. Everyone knows there are “secrets” and “secret societies” within the government revolving around corruption, it should be no surprise. So keep your eyes on the bigger picture, because you are bound to miss out on other major things happening if you are continually distracted.

Having been grilled by Democratic lawmakers over her recollections of a White House meeting in which President Trump described some poor nations sending immigrants to the United States as “shithole countries,” Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen dropped a potentially even bigger tape-bomb.

The Hill reports that Nielsen testified she did not recall Trump saying “shithole countries” while she spoke under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee. She described the meeting as heated and said many people in the room used coarse language.

“I don’t remember the specific words [Trump used],” Nielsen said under questioning from Durbin. “What I was struck with, frankly as I’m sure you were as well, was the general profanity that was used in the room by almost everyone.”

But then Nielsen shocked more than a few Democratic leaders across the nation, who appear to have grown accustomed to living beyond the law.

According to The Washington Times, Nielsen confirmed Tuesday that her department has asked federal prosecutors to see if they can lodge criminal charges against sanctuary cities that refuse to cooperate with federal deportation efforts.

“The Department of Justice is reviewing what avenues may be available,” Ms. Nielsen told the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Her confirmation came after California’s new sanctuary law went into effect Jan. 1, severely restricting cooperation the state or any of its localities could offer.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Tom Homan says those policies put his officers and local communities at more risk because they have to arrest illegal immigrants out in the community.

Mr. Homan told The Washington Times last July that he wanted to see local officials charged as complicit in human smuggling if they shielded illegal immigrants through sanctuary policies. Mr. Homan repeated that demand in an interview with Fox News earlier this year, setting off a firestorm of criticism.

861,976,Study Reveals Humans Lived Long Lives Before Modern Medicine,"“Age is not how old you are, but how many years of fun you’ve had.” – Matt Maldre

We have long been fascinated as a society with the concept of aging, how to overcome it and how our modern technological advances are helping us to take these steps. In fact, it has been predicted that the global anti-aging market will reach $216.52 billion by 2021, a staggering number when you stop to consider it. We invest time, energy and money into plastic surgery, anti-aging creams, chemical peels, anti-cellulite treatments, botox and more. Even more concerning is the fact that these efforts aren’t actually aimed at increasing our lifespan, but merely giving creating the illusion that we are younger for longer.

On the other end of the spectrum, the money and energy put into the health and fitness industry reveal a large portion of the population actively working to extend their lifespan by improving their overall health. The market in the United States alone was valued at approximately $25.8 billion in 2015.

When discussions regarding our current health care field and the incredible advances that we see in the areas of both medicine and technology come to light, we often point to the generations that came before us. By believing that we have improved our lifespan we can justify the decision that we have made, and the costs paid. However, is this statement true?

A recent study set out to further understand the lifestyle, morbidity and overall lifespan of our ancestors, specifically those in Anglo-Saxon, England. Published in the ‘Journal of Anthropological Archaeology,’ the researchers studied medical records from a number of Anglo-Saxons who died between 475 and 625 AD. Their conclusions shed a new light on our understanding of the health and longevity of people who lived during that time.

The study’s co-author Marc Oxenham of the Australian National University’s School of Archaeology and Anthropology explained, “To be sure, the advent of modern medicine, and a range of social developments, has led to the greater proportion of humanity living to old age. However, it is clear that thousands of years ago, humans were also living well into their 80s and 90s; just not a particularly high proportion of their communities managed that.”

To be clear, the study does not discount the benefits of modern medicine – today more people are reaching older ages than ever before, however, it dispels the popular misconception that our ancestors all died in their 30s and 40s. This opens the door to additional research, aimed at better understanding the health and well-being of those who lived during that time.",http://awarenessact.com/study-reveals-humans-lived-long-lives-before-modern-medicine/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
768,876,DISGUSTING: Swedish feminazis are virtually unconcerned about the soaring sexual assault crisis perpetuated by Muslim invaders…even when the victim is their own daughter,"A 45-year-old so-called “feminist” mother in Sweden not only was having a sexual relationship with an 18-year-old Afghan Muslim refugee that she had taken into her home, she refused to report him to authorities after he started sexually abusing her 12-year-old daughter.

SaveMySweden (h/t Marvin W) The 45-year-old woman was working at a refugee center in The 45-year-old woman was working at a refugee center in Sölvesborg when she began having a sexual relationship with the refugee, who claimed to be 18-years-old. When the migrant became an official refugee, he had to leave the center and so the woman allowed him to move into her family home.

Within a short period of time, the migrant began sexually abusing the woman’s 12-year-old daughter, kissing and hugging her before one incident in September 2017 when the Afghan put his hands inside the girl’s underwear and groped her vagina.

After the daughter told her mother what had happened, the 45-year-old refused to report the incident to authorities or even to ask the Afghan to leave the home, prompting the daughter to tell her father who then contacted the police.

During the subsequent trial, the woman explained that she did not take action against the refugee because she was “afraid that [he] would be sent back to Afghanistan.” “I thought so much about him so he could stay with me,” she added

The mother also told the victim’s older sisters not to reveal what had happened. Facebook posts were later uncovered showing that even months after the sexual assault on her daughter, the mother described the Afghan as “wonderful” and was attempting to help him find a new home

She was also reportedly a vehement supporter of the #MeToo movement against the sexual assault of women, but not presumably if those women are sexually assaulted by migrants. The Afghan received just 100 hours of community service for the assault and will not be deported.

Although the refugee claimed to be 18 at the time of assault, the problem of migrants lying about their age to avoid harsher prison sentences has become notorious.

An investigation by Sweden’s national forensic medicine agency found that three quarters of migrants claiming to be children were actually adults. Last week, new figures were released by Swedish criminal statistics agency Brå that showed rape cases increased 10 per cent in 2017

Sweden, now considered the “rape capital of the West” due to its leftist agenda of admitting an inexhaustible supply of Muslim rapists posing as refugees, has a shameless justice system, as evidenced by its refusal to deport 5 Afghan child rapists because they deemed it would “be too dangerous” for them under Sharia law in Afghanistan.

Yet it’s still quite shocking when a group of women who like to glorify themselves as champions of women’s rights, turn a blind eye to the women and girls, who are the main targets of these Islamic sexual predators, even when authorities announce that they had recovered 48 different stains of semen from a gang-rape victim’s clothing after launching an investigation into one of the worst cases of migrant sex attacks the country has ever seen.

Thanks to mass Muslim migration, mostly from Islamic countries, Sweden has seen a 1,472-percent increase in rapes and a 300-percent increase in violent crimes just 4 decades after opening their borders. The European country now tops the list at number 2 for countries with the most rapes, surpassed only by Lesotho. Statistics now suggest that 1 in 4 Swedish women will be raped",http://barenakedislam.com/2018/01/24/disgusting-swedish-feminazis-are-virtually-unconcerned-about-the-soaring-sexual-assault-crisis-perpetuated-by-muslim-invaders-even-when-the-victim-is-their-own-daughter/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

409,475,San Diego parents fought hard to keep CAIR’s Islamic agenda out of their public schools…AND WON!,"S an Diego school board members agreed Tuesday night to end its parnership with designated terrorist group CAIR on a campaign allegedly to fight anti-Muslim bullying generated by an exaggerated and mostly fake CAIR report. But as you will see below, the ‘anti-bullying’ program was merely a smoke screen which would then allow CAIR’s real agenda of Islamic indoctrination of children to emerge.



Investigative Project This is how it began: The San Diego Unified School District (SDUSD) teamed up with the designated terrorist group CAIR (Council on American-Islamic Relations), a radical Islamic organization, to devise and enforce an unconstitutional “anti-Islamophobia” bullying program. As part of this program, Muslim students were to get special protections and additional access to resources, while students of other faiths were excluded.

CAIR has been in bed with the San Diego school district since 2015. In fact, in November 2015, the board of education recognized CAIR for its community efforts.

In preparation for the following school years, the San Diego board of education had already outlined the CAIR plan, despite the fact that parents were rejecting its points of action:

CAIR representative can’t contain his exhilaration when the San Diego Unified school district initally agreed to adopt the CAIR Islamic Indoctrination program for their schools.

The agenda item specifically mentioned that school board “staff is redirected from forming a formal partnership with CAIR to forming an intercultural committee which shall include representatives of from all faiths and cultures and which shall provide input to District staff on issues of cultural sensitivities and the individual needs of various subgroups within our diverse community.”

Not surprisingly for Caliphornia, leftist speaker after speaker criticized the proposal for excluding CAIR and for not specifically emphasizing anti-Muslim bigotry and “Islamophobia.” CAIR-San Diego Executive Director Hanif Mohebi managed to make that argument while still denying CAIR was singularly focused.

“We have never come out saying that it should only be one group. But I think also we should realize that it might be a mistake not to focus on groups that are targeted much more than the rest,” Mohebi said. “So that being said, we expect the district to publicly acknowledge and recognize the work that we have done for over a decade with the school district.”

It was obvious, though, that board members reluctantly decided to implement a broader policy addressing bullying across cultures and religious backgrounds.

Vice President Kevin Beiser reaffirmed his support for CAIR and thanked it for over a decade of partnership, but said supported the revised proposal “because I believe it codifies the board’s commitment and my commitment to making sure that all students are safe. We do have certain groups of students who are bullied at much higher rates than other students.

San Diego parents not only protested this CAIR-sponsored program, they filed a lawsuit against the school district to stop it.

sued the school district i n May, claiming the program did place Muslim students above others, violating the First Amendment’s establishment clause, the Fourteenth Amendment and California law barring assistance to religion. They also claimed the anti-bullying program was a solution to an exaggerated problem. But lawyers with the Freedom of Conscience Defense Fund (FCDF)n May, claiming the program did place Muslim students above others, violating the First Amendment’s establishment clause, the Fourteenth Amendment and California law barring assistance to religion. They also claimed the anti-bullying program was a solution to an exaggerated problem.

None of the speakers advocating for CAIR’s continued involvement addressed that Constitutional concern. But the anti-bullying program was never about “promoting a religion” as some critics claimed, said Board President Richard Barerra.

lawsuit A report by CAIR’s California chapters, “Growing in Faith: California Muslim Youth Experiences with Bullying, Harassment & Religious Accommodation in Schools” inspired the program, FCDF’sclaims.

The school district’s decision to back away from partnering with CAIR is an important victory, FCDF Executive Director Daniel Piedra told the Investigative Project on Terrorism (IPT). But he remains concerned that CAIR still may partner with the school district on other programs. Mohebi and his allies seemed upset that they will not be able to use the school district to further their agenda, Piedra said after the meeting.

“They talk about equality, but it’s really Orwellian because in their philosophy and the school board’s philosophy, they are really saying that all students are equal but that some students are more equal than others,” Piedra said.

consent decree FCDF could seek monetary damages, he said, but it may ask a judge to impose acompelling the school district to not partner with CAIR again.

Under the now-abandoned program, students accused of bullying Muslim students were supposed to face “ restorative justice,” requiring them to reconcile with the other student. The school district would provide monthly reports on the bullying of Muslim students and post them online.

The district’s reversal follows the FCDF’s amended complaint filed last month, which challenged CAIR’s local effort to hide behind the label of being a “civil rights organization.” It pointed to testimony by CAIR co-founder and Executive Director Nihad Awad, who told the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) that it lacked jurisdiction over a fight over unionizing CAIR employees because CAIR is a religious organization.

Establishment Clause CAIR letterhead includes the invocation, “In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful,” which opens every chapter in the Quran, Charles L. Posner, regional director of the National Labor Relations Board, wrote in an April 7 ruling. This religious acknowledgement goes to the heart of the‘s separation of church and state.

i nstituted a policy The loss of the San Diego program is a set-back for CAIR’s desire to take an “anti-Muslim bullying” program national. It represents the biggest government rebuke to CAIR since the FBIin 2008 to break-off outreach programs due to CAIR’s documented history in a Muslim-Brotherhood created Hamas-support network in the United States.

And it should send a message to districts throughout the country, Piedra said, warning CAIR that his organization will sue any public school district that partners with it in a similar anti-bullying program. “We want to be sure for the benefit of our schoolchildren that CAIR is kept out of America’s schools,” Piedra said.

If not for the determined parents in San Diego, what you see in the video below was on its way to being entrenched in the public schools there, not to mention all around the country in the future as CAIR planned.

2191,2513,The Vaccine Program’s Unintended Consequences: A Tale of Two Hepatitis B Studies,"The Vaccine Program’s Unintended Consequences: A Tale of Two Hepatitis B Studies

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

By the World Mercury Project Team

In 1991, US public health authorities began recommending that all infants get the hepatitis B (HepB) vaccine, stipulating that they receive three doses within the first six months of life, starting at birth. The World Health Organization (WHO) followed suit with its own recommendation in 1992, instructing countries to vaccinate from birth even where hepatitis B virus was uncommon. Two 2018 studies (one in the US and one in India) take a closer look at the outcomes and implications of these blanket prescriptions. Although the studies focus on different aspects of their countries’ respective vaccine programs, both are cautionary tales, highlighting the fact that one-size-fits-all vaccine recommendations frequently steamroll over important biological risks and immune system subtleties, thereby introducing troublesome unintended consequences.

U.S. children and taxpayers on the hook

Until the early 2000s, the HepB vaccine in the US contained organic ethylmercury in the form of the preservative thimerosal—totaling 37.5 micrograms across the three doses. Regulators have never bothered to set any safety standards for ethylmercury, but government researchers have shown that the toxicity mechanisms of ethyl- and methylmercury (the type of mercury found in fish) are similar, and some believe that even the tiniest amounts carry a risk of adverse neuropsychological outcomes.

Fixated on the sole indicator of increasing HepB vaccine coverage, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) bragged in 2002 about having achieved a 90% national coverage rate in young children. However, a 2018 cross-sectional study published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health strongly suggests that the 1990s-era thimerosal-containing HepB vaccine had far less praiseworthy consequences, causing considerable harm to children and also exacting a high price from US taxpayers.

The researchers used National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data to consider 1,192 boys aged 7-8 years—a sample statistically representative of over 24 million American boys. Building on their own and others’ prior research linking thimerosal to developmental disabilities, they considered boys who either did or did not receive three doses of thimerosal-containing (1994–2000) or thimerosal-reduced (2001–2007) HepB vaccine in infancy (the “exposure”), defining the outcome as increased long-term risk of receiving special education services. They restricted their sample to boys because of males’ greater susceptibility to mercury toxicity.

For the subgroup born between 1994 and 2000, boys who received three doses of thimerosal-containing HepB vaccine were at a more than nine-fold significantly higher risk of receiving special education services compared to boys receiving no doses of HepB vaccine. Extrapolating to the US population as a whole, this means that almost 1.3 million US boys born from 1994-2000 received special education services directly attributable to receiving three doses of thimerosal-containing HepB vaccine—costing taxpayers over $180 billion. An earlier study by some of the same authors found that in the decade from 1991–2001, exposure to thimerosal-containing HepB vaccines in the first six months of life resulted in an estimated 0.5–1 million US children being diagnosed with learning disabilities, representing lifetime costs in excess of $1 trillion.

Vaccine-induced versus natural immunity

As noted, the WHO has strongly promoted universal HepB vaccination and particularly the initial birth dose. However, in India, which introduced the HepB vaccine around 2006, approximately three-fifths (61%) of women deliver at home rather than in a health facility, making it next to impossible for health providers to administer newborn vaccines. In recognition of these realities, the Indian government’s two-pronged policy is to give HepB vaccine at birth to the 39% of babies born in institutional settings but to otherwise administer the first dose at six weeks. About 45% of Indian children receive the birth dose (although the WHO wants to double that number); irrespective of timing, 86% of Indian children reportedly receive all three HepB doses. However, India is home to an estimated one-third of the world’s unvaccinated children, meaning that many children still do not receive any HepB vaccine at all.

A 2018 study published in the Indian Journal of Pediatrics took advantage of these ready-made comparison groups. The multiregional study (2013–2015) recruited children 1-5 years of age who were already having blood drawn and whose parents consented to hepatitis B testing (N=2,671). Three-fifths (59%) of the children had received at least three doses of HepB vaccine, and just over half of these (880/1566) had their first dose at birth. The research team considered several intriguing questions:

Are there any differences in vaccine efficacy for the two HepB schedules (birth dose versus six-week dose)? After testing all samples for a marker of chronic hepatitis B infection, the investigators concluded that birth vaccination offered “no added protection”—lending support to the government’s “pragmatic” approach of waiting until six weeks to vaccinate babies born at home. What are the levels of protective antibodies in fully HepB-vaccinated children, and do they change over time or according to birth dose? The researchers measured antibodies in a subset of 865 children who had received three doses of HepB vaccine. Seven in ten (70%) had protective levels of antibodies—but 30% of fully HepB-vaccinated children did not [emphasis added]. Moreover, when the researchers considered the children’s age, they found that vaccine-induced protection waned rapidly and significantly, falling from 82% of under-one-year-olds to 47% of five-year-olds. Receiving a birth dose made no difference. What are the levels of protective antibodies in children who have not received any HepB vaccine? Finally, the researchers examined hepatitis B immunity in 370 children who had never received any HepB vaccine. Nearly half (45%) of non-HepB-vaccinated one-year-olds were naturally immune, and 29% still had antibody protection at age 5. The researchers credited these protective levels of antibodies to natural, passively acquired immunity from unvaccinated mothers.

Overzealous promotion

The results of the two hepatitis B studies touch on many facets of the vaccine debate that the public health community is rarely, if ever, willing to discuss. These largely ignored topics include:

The ongoing, adverse neurodevelopmental impact of toxic vaccine ingredients such as aluminum adjuvants and thimerosal, which is still present in annual flu shots, some meningococcal meningitis vaccines and the Td (tetanus-diphtheria) booster;

The fact that economic and political factors—rather than vaccine effectiveness—are often key drivers of decisions about vaccine timing and schedules

The failure of HepB (and other) vaccines to reliably generate protective antibody levels in all fully vaccinated individuals—this phenomenon of impaired immunogenicity is a widely known “Achilles’ heel” of many vaccines; and

The corresponding (and vastly underestimated) importance of natural immunity.

Regarding this latter point, the authors of the Indian HepB research, led by Dr. Jacob Puliyel, call attention to the “surprising” persistence of passively acquired hepatitis B antibodies in their own study population and in other studies. Pointing to studies of measles immunity, they note that mothers in highly measles-vaccinated communities have lower antibody levels and, therefore, far less ability to confer passive protection to their babies. This is because the measles vaccine “induces lower antibody levels than does natural infection and the antibody levels of vaccinated cohorts are no longer boosted by exposure to wild-type infection.” A study in the Czech Republic that compared 18-29-year-olds who were vaccinated and unvaccinated for mumps found that only 19% of vaccinated individuals in that age group had acquired immunity versus almost half (48%) of the unvaccinated, leading to the conclusion that only natural infection can lead to “long-term persistence of antibodies.” A growing number of studies also are indicating that prior exposure to natural infections such as measles and mumps may be health-protective later in life.

Back in 2003, Dr. Puliyel wrote a letter to the editor that questioned other researchers’ overestimation of the benefits of hepatitis B vaccination in terms of vaccine efficacy and cost per life-year saved. The letter concluded with a caution to guard against “overzealous” vaccine promotion. In the current climate of an ever-expanding vaccine schedule and hundreds more vaccines in the pipeline, those words of warning seem timelier than ever.",http://beforeitsnews.com/health/2018/01/the-vaccine-programs-unintended-consequences-a-tale-of-two-hepatitis-b-studies-2810005.html,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

“Learn how to see. Realize that everything connects to everything else. ~ Leonardo Da Vinci

Meditation itself is a trick. It is thought to be a complicated practice, but that is confusion. The trick begins in the following contrast: Meditation is a simple practice, and yet it enables us to understand, and to perform, complexity.

Meditation is a practice that benefits the practitioner in innumerable ways, enabling mind and body. And like a lot of magic tricks, this trick really is simply a shift of perspective — and a changed perspective can shift everything else, most immediately our thinking and feeling. If we can shift our state of being to be relaxed during the intense part of the game, we can win. If we can shift our state of being to be relaxed during stressful times, we keep our cool. Meditation is a trick of perspective.

But more than that, meditation enhances our perspective, our consciousness. The word “consciousness” is used to illustrate our deep thinking and feeling. I like to say that consciousness is the awareness of our awareness. Understanding and further practicing meditation enhances our consciousness looking inward; understanding geometry enhances our consciousness looking outward. (See: The Mandala: The Sacred Geometry of Meditation.)

Enhanced consciousness enhances our physical wellbeing and capability. If our consciousness is unwell and our body well, we might easily become upset or depressed, ultimately becoming destructive to our health both internally and externally. But if our consciousness is well and our body is unwell, we might still be joyful and productive, and we are more likely to become well. (Consciousness rules!)

Enhancing our consciousness also increases our ability to gain control over self, and our ability to accomplish in a productive and enhanced manner. For this reason, meditation is a simple way to trick ourselves to be our most happy and authentic selves.

Meditation for the Youth

“If every eight year old in the world is taught meditation, we will eliminate violence from the world within one generation.” ~ Dalai Lama

If there is one thing that can help individuals be joyful and productive it is meditation. It can help individuals to help themselves, and yet, few people are promoting it generally, and even less so among young people. My inspiration for writing my latest book, “Meditation and Geometry for The Youth“, was because I realized how lacking meditation instruction is, at home, in schools, in life and even in many yoga classes.

My other inspiration stems from a conversation I had with a meditation teacher. Long story short, I was facing an immense problem and was upset over it, and moreover I thought it was the biggest problem in the world. What the problem was is not important. The fact that I felt it was a hugely significant problem is what’s important.

The conversation went like this:

“I have been thinking a lot about the world and all the people,” I said. “I have been thinking about the problems in my life, and the lives all the people in the whole world, and I think I understand what the biggest problem in the world is. And I think if we could address just this one issue, all the world’s problems would all be solved.”

I thought at the time that if this one problem could just be solved, everything else would be OK. Have you ever felt that way? Have you ever felt that if you had just one thing, or if things were different in just one way, than all else would perfectly fall into place?

I continued to tell the teacher what the problem was, and the teacher was stunned but also grinned. As huge a global issue as it was, the problem might as well have been a small personal one. After thinking for a moment he responded,

“This problem you describe is a very serious one. And all the other problems of the world are serious too, those which are connected and those which are disconnected to this problem you describe. But what is an even bigger problem is the mess from where that problem comes from. The greatest problem in the world, no matter what anyone says, the problem from which all the other problems originate from, is the problem of our lacking consciousness and our unwell consciousness.”

I was struck. I felt silly. He of course was right. All the problems of the world, and all the problems of your world, all stem from our unwell consciousness. Every external problem begins as an internal problem, or something out of balance.

That’s where meditation can help — and to change our world, we need to start with our youth.

A strong and steady consciousness solves problems and, just as importantly, does not create them in the first place. A healthy consciousness does not react in a way that creates problems but responds thoughtfully, mindfully creating the future.

This conversation made me realize the importance of helping others learn meditation, particularly our youth, so they in turn can help themselves, so they can develop consciousness, and so that problems great and small might meet creative solutions, not just today but in the future.

“What if we learned to be at peace with ourselves from an early age? … Just imagine how much future generations of children would gain from this regular practice… if every child was able to connect to the ocean of consciousness that permeates all that is…” ~ Will Stanton

9962,11238,The Fed: Economy is Gloomy because Americans are “Hoarding Money”,"Subscribe to Canada Free Press for FREE

Investing money in or starting small businesses-- Backbone of America

The Fed: Economy is Gloomy because Americans are “Hoarding Money”

In a moment of recent hand-wringing, the Fed examined the question of why inflation has stayed extremely low in the United States despite all the efforts of quantitative easing money pumping. Their answer: American consumers are mainly to blame.

Yes indeed. In a paper released this week by the St. Louis Federal Reserve, the Fed cites “low level of money movement in large part on consumers and their “willingness to hoard money.”. To be fair, the paper also criticized its own policies as well, suggesting that the has they have “reinforced the recession” with their “excessively low interest rate policy”. However, “hoarding money” is seen as the main culprit and attributable to two factors: A (gloomy) economy after the financial crisis. The dramatic decrease in interest rates that has forced investors to readjust their portfolios toward liquid money and away from interest-bearing assets such as government bonds The use of the word hoarding is key to understanding the contempt here. They didn’t say “willingness to save money”, they said “willingness to hoard money”. Saving would imply prudence while hoarding implies selfishness, carefully guarded. It’s like a petulant temper tantrum: why won’t you spend your money for the good of the economy?!

Anti-business climate which is displayed by the current administration Equally stunning is the lack of discussion with regard to investors. They point out that investors aren’t investing in interest-bearing assets “such as government bonds”, but completely omit the reality that investors aren’t investing in businesses either. And this is key. This is a result of the anti-business climate which is displayed by the current administration. People used to spend their money investing in or even starting small businesses. That was the backbone of America. It’s not so much anymore. This administration has been exceedingly heavy-handed in its efforts to demonize businesses, while promising that businesses will be highly taxed and regulated. Additionally there have been huge increases in both criminal rules and regulations about what businesses are allowed and not allowed to do, along with a litigation-friendly environment. All anyone ever reads in the paper is that the government is spending their time and money going after businesses and penalizing them, so much that we are truly becoming dissuaded from going into business anymore. A few months ago, I wrote about the liberty of risk after the WSJ posted an article by Ben Casselman, who noted the very real decline of risk-taking in business ventures. It is this downward trend which is a major contributor to the fact that the recovery from the recent recession is so painfully slow and anemic. The people’s appetite for investing has been totally decimated by the war on businesses being waged. And don’t forget, we apparently have lost our appetite for spending too, because we “hoard money” these days (whatever is leftover in a paycheck to actually be able to hoard, that is) in this “gloomy economy”.

1385,1614,Mom Sparks Controversy After Posting Video Of What Toy Doll She Got For Child Actually Says,"Every year there is a hot new toy that all the kids want from Santa. Most parents will stand in lines and pay the ultimate price to make their little ones happy with the sought after toy.Siobhan Fox from Tamworth, England is like most moms. When her two-year-old daughter was pining for the “My Little Baby Born,” doll for Christmas, she got it for her. But, after the doll was unwrapped by the excited little girl, she realized that she may have made a big mistake.

The doll, which is supposed to say pre-recorded phrases, was heard saying quite the opposite of the “mama” and “dada” she was expecting.

Instead, she thinks that the doll said “You…bit*#.”

In the video below, you can watch the doll as it coos and giggles. Amongst the laughter, the doll says something that sounds like “You b,” but it’s pretty hard to tell for sure what she is saying.

The doll is currently being sold for under $20 on U.K.’s Toys R’ Us website. While the store is offering Fox a refund or exchange, she is demanding that the doll is pulled off the shelves and recalled instead.

Zapf Creations is the German toy company that developed the doll and they have responded by saying that the baby babbles are not intended to sound vulgar in any way.

In a statement, the company shared the following…

“At Zapf Creation, we take all feedback very seriously. Our BABY born products are created to be a fun introduction to the imaginative parent-child play. The My Little BABY born Walks doll includes baby babble sounds that are in no way meant to represent language or cause any offense to users.”

Evidently, this isn’t the first time that a parent has issued a complaint about the Baby Born doll. A Birmingham, England mom said that her daughter was heard repeating the words “You B….” after she was playing with the doll. And another customer complained that it sounds like the doll is swearing.

“That was what she really wanted and I felt so awful taking it off her but I could not let her go out in public with the doll saying that,” said Fox, who was concerned about her two-year-old repeating the words.

Some commenters didn’t hear the swearing at all and felt that the mom was overreacting…

“People have to complain about every little thing. I don’t hear “swear” words. I hear “Yippie Yippie.”

“Just sounds like “yippie” on a child’s toy talk box with poor audio quality. Get over it.”

“You must have a sweet life if that’s all you have to make a big deal out of.”

“I can’t make it out. But I know sometimes nearly indistinguishable sounds will mean different things to different people.”

And others found the humor in the situation, considering the doll was filmed right next to a glass of champagne…

“I see the problem. Clearly, the baby has been drinking champagne..foul words happen when you get a wee pie-eyed.”

Another commenter mentioned the fact that the doll might be worth something someday and the mom should keep it.",http://awm.com/mom-sparks-controversy-after-posting-video-of-what-toy-doll-she-got-for-child-actually-says/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
823,934,Log Off Now: Researchers Have Determined That It Is Bedtime,"People who are awake right now, you’re gonna wanna read this one, because if you aren’t asleep at this very second, science says you’re doing it wrong. According to a groundbreaking new study, researchers have discovered that it’s time to log off because you need to go to bed.

The evidence is conclusive: It is bedtime so you should be asleep, no ifs, ands, or buts about it.

“After analyzing all available data, there is no doubt that it is currently bedtime,” reads the study. “At the moment, it is crucial that you save all your Word documents, power down your CPU, and crawl under your covers. Considering empirical data and statistical projections, we are more than 99.9% certain that you need to tuck in and get some shut-eye.”

Researchers caution that if you read to the end of this article, you are waiting too long to go to sleep, because now is irrefutably bedtime. There is good news, however, for people who are already asleep, because scientists have discovered that they aren’t being stubborn little babies like you.

Wow, this is a real wake-up call to be asleep. It completely overturns the previously held theory that you’re not tired, and you just want five more minutes before bed, come on please, just five minutes. Who knows what the next big scientific developments in bedtime will bring!

Christensen is a former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs. Currently he is the William P. Boswell Professor of World Politics and director of the China and World Program at Princeton University. After reading his book, you might well conclude that there is little about China and Asia he does not know.

We are mostly dependent on various news stories about China to have any idea what is occurring, but the fact remains that just as the U.S. has its optimists and pessimists, conservatives and liberals who influence policy the same exists for China, so a lot depends on who is being quoted. Generally, though, it is only the top leaders who are. That means we are getting the Chinese “party line” and the occasional general or admiral warning against any aggression.

China did not begin to awaken as a modern nation until after the death of Mao Zedong, the founder of the People’s Republic of China, a Communist with a capital “C.” Christensen notes that, while keeping its political ideology, the leader that followed him made a “peaceful transformation launched under CCP leader Deng Xiaopping in 1978 and the collapse of the superpower Soviet Union thirteen years later that made China appear to stand tall again among the great powers.” The transitition was to a capitalist-based economy.

These days the Chinese and the Russians are making efforts to achieve areas of cooperation and, in particular, their militaries. They hold drills together for common defense strategies.

Christensen believes that “China’s return to great power status is perhaps the most important challenges in twenty-first century American diplomacy”, but to put that in context he points out that “China’s per capita income is only one fifth that of the United States” and “though a true trade superpower, many of its exporters are controlled at least in part by foreign investors.”

“Still, the pessimists do not give enough credit to the sustainability of U.S. leadership in Asia,” says Christensen. “For example, they often underestimate the value of American’s unparalleled network of allies and security partners.” You can be sure that the Chinese leadership does not.

They also have, as one would expect, concerns about U.S. military power in their area of the world, but they feel the same about Japan and South Korea as well. “China is not currently an enemy of the United States,” says Christensen, nor is it likely to be for a long time to come.

“It does not need to be contained like the (former) Soviet Union. Nor should China become the kind of regional or global adversary that we have faced in the past, although that outcome, unfortunately, is still a distinct possibility.” That possibility depends on China’s leadership now and in the future. For now they are concentrating on their economy and are likely to do so for many years to come.



“China’s economic clout is real and growing rapidly, especially since the 2008 financial crisis. China has been the main engine of growth for the world’s economy since that time and, by some measures, has become the world’s number one trading state.” There is only one reason why the U.S. has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and his name is Barack Obama.

I suspect that Obama is held in disdain by the Chinese leadership despite all the public handshakes. For one thing, China weathered the financial crisis far better than the U.S. “One of the burdens the new Obama administration inherited in early 2009 was a China bearing a mix of cockiness and insecurity that would negatively influence its policies in 2009-2010,” says Christensen and as the U.S. foundered in Afghanistan and Iraq “American power inspired less awe.”

“Sometime in 2012, the ‘Asia pivot’” of the Obama administration “would be jettisoned in Washington for the more subtle ‘Asia rebalance.’” If you get the feeling that the Obama administration has no real China policy or one that will have little influence, you are right.

With regard to China, It likely does not matter what the Obama administration does for its remaining one and a half years in office.

Various scholars and diplomats will continue to keep a watchful eye on China and most surely many corporate leaders and U.S. entrepreneurs will do so as well given its huge population as a marketplace. It’s already a great tourist destination.

Napoleon was right.

The day started off with some excitement…

But by the close all was forgotten…

China put the fear of god into a few bond traders this morning…(30Y spiked 5bps higher only to close down 1bps on the day)

And prompted the herd-like response proclaiming that this is it – bond yields are blowing out. However, thanks to a super-strong 10Y auction, bonds were bid back into the green leaving 10Y yields lower on the day…

And the yield curve flattened dramatically…

All the major US equity indices closed lower (except for Trannies which ramped into the close), but were well off the lows…

Equity futures show the full excitement of the day better than the cash open to close…

VIX was briefly punched back above 10 on China and more shenanigans around the cash open/VIX auction, but closed below 10…

High yield bond prices continue to tumble…

Breaking back below its 50-, 100- and 200-DMA…(almost unchanged now on the year)

The Dollar Index ended lower but followed the same pattern as everything else today as it plunged on China headlines but it spiked after headlines about US pulling out of NAFTA struck… then faded again after The White House statement that Trump’s position had not changed…

The peso and loonie tumbled… but then rebounded after The White House made the statement

This NAFTA headline also slammed GM, Trains, and Constellation Brands (as well as Canadian and Mexican ETFs). The stocks rebounded modestly on The White House statement…

Gold gained on the day (but gave back some of the China panic gains) as WTI ended the day lower marginally…

Gold is outperforming Bitcoin YTD…

In crypto land, ETH was the winner again and XRP the loser and BTC and LTC trod water. Notably, the crypto space rallied after Buffett’s negative comments…

Finally, Rudy Havenstein summed it up perfectly…

A bipartisan group of civil liberty supporters in the Senate is working to defund Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ civil asset forfeiture schemes.

Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Angus King (I-Vt.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), and Tom Udall (D-N.M.) are working to include an amendment to the appropriations bill which would block funding for federal asset forfeiture programs.

In a letter to Sen. Richard Shelby, a ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, the liberty concerned lawmakers wrote:

Adoptive forfeiture and equitable sharing are particularly egregious elements of civil asset forfeiture because they not only violate due process but also attack principles of federalism. DOJ’s reinstated policy allows state law enforcement officers to circumvent state limitations on civil forfeiture by turning seized property over to federal officials for forfeiture in exchange for up to 80 percent of the proceeds of the property. This perversely incentivizes local law enforcement to confiscate suspect property even where state laws forbid the practice.

Over the past few years, several state legislatures have taken steps to limit or eliminate local law enforcement civil asset forfeiture programs. But Sessions, in a directive earlier this year, provided a loophole for the departments by getting federal agencies involved.

Sessions’ dual assault on state rights and civil liberty allows local police to run civil property seizures through federal court. Property stolen from owners by the federal government is then divided among participating agencies via “equitable sharing.”

Aside from remote stretches of sandy beach on South Padre Island, I can say without reservation that Big Bend is probably the best slice of outdoors this sprawling flat state has to offer. Cradled against a grand turn of the Rio Grande River, and sharing 118 desolate miles with Old Mexico crawling with dope smugglers and human coyotes, and wacko nut-jobs on both sides of the border laying low or on the lam, Big Bend National Park and the surrounding, inhospitable terrain elevates the wild and wooly, and the wonderful, to superlative extremes.

Harsh, prickly country unique and brash in that romantic Texas kind-of-a-way, I continue to dredge up fond memories of our autumn visit a few years ago; the solid image of a large, reddish-brown mountain lion, or cougar, sporting a long tail, gliding gently across the road on our drive down from the castle of jagged cliffs enveloping Chisos Basin. I also recall, rather vividly, getting trapped in a shoot as we scrambled into steep-walled Santa Elena Canyon while someone on the film-set down by the river’s edge screamed in a blood-curdling tizzy, “Get the #@%* out of the way! We’re trying to make a movie!”

Things have never been the same after July 16, 1945 when they blew up the “gadget” on the northern fringes of the White Sands Missile Range in southern New Mexico, the largest military installation in the United States. Regrettably called the Trinity site, this historic landmark is where an atomic bomb perched atop a 100-foot tower made quite the splash as the first of its kind, casting radioactive fallout far and wide, most of which drifted north and east. But lingering radioactive contamination from that 200-yard-wide fireball that melted sand to glass was the least of my worries as I wandered dazed and delighted through the heart of 115-square-miles of rolling dunes within White Sands National Monument (WSNM), roughly 60 miles south of that exploding nuclear implosion.

I was more worried about going blind without my sunglasses, slogging among sugar-white, rippling hills of bone-dry snow, up one cone and down the other, or getting turned around out there and dying a lonely parched death by thirst among the vastness, swallowed up by a rolling ocean of bleached gypsum with camera in hand, clicking and snapping as I captured in digital bits and bytes the end of my life and the perennially shifting contours of this grainy surface of moon on earth.

There was a time in my life when I thought the only contribution the little town of Forks in northwestern Washington made to civilization was rain, receiving over 100 inches of the dreary slop each and every year. That shows you what I knew, and how utterly unsophisticated I am because concealed in this old, middle-class logging town wedged between Olympic National Park to the southeast and 60 miles of wilderness beach a few miles west are handsome, albeit pasty-looking, blood-sucking vampires casting bedroom eyes at exposed necklines, breathing deep and working up ferocious appetites for things dripping, red and raw.

For years Hollywood has been enamored with Fort Bragg and the northern reaches of the quintessentially craggy Mendocino Coast. It’s a great place to film. Parts of “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” (1975) with Jack Nicholson was filmed here, as was “Overboard” (1987) starring Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell, and “The Majestic” (2001) with Jim Carrey. The 1966 hit “The Russians are Coming, The Russians are Coming,” which seemed a lot funnier back then, was also filmed at Fort Bragg, Noyo Harbor, and quaint and beautiful Mendocino a few miles down the road.

Relative isolation helped protect this beautiful stretch of real estate from California’s 40 million residents who would overrun this pristine old logging and fishing town three to four hours north of San Francisco if you gave them half a chance. It’s not distance alone that shields the restored Victorian homes, gorgeous harbor and phenomenal sand beaches from the outside world, but coastal mountains as well, and maddening corkscrew roads that twist and turn and bend sharply through steep forested terrain once dense with towering redwoods now toppled and long gone for the most part.

One languid week basking in the sun under stellar blue skies near the coast lulled me into a false sense of expectation, though I should have seen the clouds on the horizon. There’s good reason why Olympic National Park on the Olympic Peninsula is lush and green in shades beyond comprehension. It rains too much, which is why this spectacular emerald gem thrives rich with huge, towering Douglas fir and ramrod-straight western hemlock and Sitka spruce.

Mercifully protected from the saw and ax, these trees are left to grow old, snapping and falling of their own accord over time onto rich black dirt, crushing tall ferns and massive globs of fluorescent green moss on their descent; toppling over as they were meant to, without our interference, with natural dignity, these wonderful old-growth giants as wide as a man is tall.

It’s easy to write this place off as just another jumbled pile of boulders in the middle of nowhere until you appreciate the uniqueness of southwestern New Mexico’s City of Rocks. Mind-altering and a photographer’s delight, especially during the orange glow of early dawn, there are only 6 other places like this in the world.

Located halfway between Deming and Silver City, out on the grassy plains of the Mimbres Valley along the northern edge of the Chihuahuan desert, this sprawling fantasy land of towering monoliths, sculpted spires, twisting alleys and side streets and hidden coves have sheltered prehistoric Indians, provided sanctuary for roaming Apaches on the warpath, and enticed Spanish conquistadors and explorers for centuries. More recently 50,000 visitors, allegedly, scramble through this playful maze each year that is guaranteed to make you feel young at heart no matter how old you really are.

On August 9, 2002, while pursuing two members of a Mexican drug cartel who fled across the border from the land of severed heads and charred bodies into the United States with apparent ease, 28-year-old Ranger Kristopher Eggle was shot at Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument. One of the suspects opened fire with an AK-47 assault rifle striking Eggle below his protective vest, killing him.

His senseless death, and a host of other security-related problems that have plagued Organ Pipe over the years, prompted the National Park Rangers Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police to designate Organ Pipe the most dangerous park (technically a national monument) in the nation. And what a pity that is.

On May 26, 1863, while the great armies of the Civil War slaughtered each other with calculated fury back East, six gold prospectors camped a dozen miles west of Montana’s Madison River beside a creek in a draw between the Gravelly Range and Tobacco Root Mountains, way out there in the middle of nowhere. Having escaped their own capture by Crow Indian warriors, and now headed for the gold camps at Bannack, one of those miners, Bill Fairweather, scooped a little dirt into Henry Edgar’s pan hoping to find some tobacco “money” in the form of gold. It payed off and what followed was nothing short of mayhem.

Within a year 10,000 - 30,000 people, depending on your source, packed into a string of nine communities along a 14-mile stretch in and around Alder Gulch and exploited one of the richest gold deposits in North America. Many got rich. Most didn’t.

Among southern Utah’s five magnificent national parks, Capitol Reef deserves special acclaim because it’s less crowded, less commercial, holds bragging rights to red-rock scenery rivaling that of Arches, Bryce, Canyonlands or Zion, and in a day when admission fees are skyrocketing to preposterous levels, except for the official ten-mile “Scenic Drive” it’s the only national park in southern Utah that’s free, for the time being.

Rugged beyond belief and to its credit, remote, this 378-square-mile park is a long, narrow strip of stunning geology, a classic monocline, a 100-mile-long stepped-up wrinkle called the “Waterpocket Fold,” or upthrust, that stretches from the Thousand Lake Plateau north of tiny Torrey, south to the still waters of the Colorado River known today as Lake Powell by most, and Lake Foul by those who continue to mourn Glen Canyon’s senseless inundation.

Standing near Fort Stevens looking out across the big blue Pacific on the extreme northwest corner of the Oregon Coast near Astoria where the mighty Columbia River empties into the sea I thought to myself: “No wonder the Japanese lost the war.” It was in the dark of night on June 12, 1942, when an Imperial submarine surfaced and lobbed 17 shells in the general vicinity of the fort before slinking off having inflicted no serious injury to speak of, their aim was that bad.

Things quieted down after that, for a while. The Fort Stevens I remember wasn’t at war back in 1978. A hulking mass of abandoned concrete military bunkers out in the woods near the shore, it welcomed our unfettered exploration with not a soul in sight. Back then we camped at will and enjoyed miles of empty pristine beaches where me and my gal stripped and frolicked under a hot August sun in cold rolling waves, big ones, that roared ashore in foaming predictability.

Nestled in the foothills on the edge of broad and spacious Flint Creek Valley, surrounded by mountains laden in past times with vast deposits of silver, manganese, sapphires, and to a lesser extent gold, beautiful historic Philipsburg is an anomaly because it’s still standing. As one of twenty rowdy mining communities that once thrived within thirty miles of here only “P-burg” withstood the test of time. Battered and bruised and knocked down by devastating booms-and-busts endemic to that world of hard rock mining, Philipsburg kept getting up, dusted itself off and dug in for the long haul.

Granite, Tower, Rumsey, Black Pine and all the rest, home to thousands of scruffy men in those late 19th and early 20th century glory days, have vanished. Things quieted in their wake leaving us blank spots on a map or relics to ponder; crumbling foundations and rotting timbers and disintegrating piles of brick. These haunts of fanciful apparitions are a repository of story, gripping tales of hard-working men calloused inside and out, toiling twelve deadly hours each and every day, seven days a week under miserable conditions down there in the dark.

I’d never heard of Abo, Gran Quivira or Quarai when we visited New Mexico during a recent blustery May, and I wasn’t inclined to make that lonesome detour up the 55 to Estancia Basin that lies east and southish of the Manzano Mountains.

Dark green and low on the horizon, the Manzanos form a welcome barrier separating broad grassy plains the color of sand, and juniper-studded mesas, from Albuquerque’s urban dysfunction.

Leaving Billy the Kid’s Lincoln County in the side-view mirror, we barreled north toward those mountains and the Turquoise Trail, but as things go in this life of mine, I succumbed to a bad case of curiosity that flares up now and then like that itchy red rash I picked up off a toilet seat at the Lonesome Steer Grill and Swill outside Truth or Consequentials.

With few to equal her stature in the world of fine art, the late Georgia O’Keeffe (1887-1986) was one of America’s preeminent painters, producing in seven long decades an astounding legacy of roughly 900 paintings that have captivated and inspired artists and connoisseurs the world over.

While she is remembered in large measure for her close-up, occasionally abstract, renderings of flowers - the lily, the hibiscus, the poppy - much of her inspiration was derived from the landscapes of her adopted home, north-central New Mexico; specifically that aesthetically rich terrain 60 miles northwest of Santa Fe known as “O’Keeffe Country.”

Sandstone bluffs, layered and streaked, her beloved flat-topped Mt. Pedernal, adobe buildings and Spanish colonial churches, and doorways, trees and clouds, these were all source material for her unique vision.

While America’s famous journalist and travel correspondent Charles Kuralt called the Beartooth Highway “the most beautiful roadway in America,” he might have overstated his case just a bit. Granted it’s a judgment call, but for sheer beauty the Going-to-the-Sun Highway over Logan Pass in Glacier National Park leaves the Beartooth in the dust.

Never-the-less, the lofty Beartooth that rises to 10,947 feet and has been designated a National Scenic Byway can’t be denied its place among aesthetic grandeur. The chorus of accolades are well-deserved because it is beautiful, it is marvelous and other-worldly. It’s a thin-aired land of cropped tundra and green lichen among the clouds and lingering snowfields and rolling alpine grasses, and deep, deep canyons and sheer cliffs and tall mountains and roaring, sparkling rivers - away from it all.

The mighty headland named Cape Blanco on the southern Oregon Coast is regarded by many Oregonians as the western-most land protrusion in the Lower-48. It certainly feels that way as one stands overwhelmed by the scenery on the very edge of the continent. The natural drama is palpable, sensual, ... potentially erotic.

It’s a place where you can lean into the wind as it blows ashore under a broad canopy of clear blue sky whose seasonal colors shift from summer’s deep blues to winter’s dark-grays when sagging clouds verging on black roll overhead with the grace of titanic spaceships invading this water-logged state in rapid slow motion.

History buffs and visitors who appreciate turn-of-the-century architectural decadence will love Helena, Montana’s state capital of 50,000+. Affectionately called the Queen City of the Rockies, Helena exudes Old West opulence, and those rushing by to Glacier National Park up north or Yellowstone to the southeast are committing a disservice by not stopping in, if only for a brief visit.

Step into Helena and you step back in time, back to the smoky, rough-and-tumble days when the nouveau riche went to great lengths to flaunt their new-found wealth and thumb their noses at the little people who aspired to join them on Nob Hill west of town, the mansion district.

It’s that time of the year, late April when southern Utah’s high desert beckons with a shout and red-rock cliffs streaked black like tar and convoluted canyons and eroded spires demand homage, photographically speaking.

This mind-altering terrain of 377,000 rugged acres 40 miles southwest of Moab cradled between the LaSal, Abajo and Henry Mountains and trisected by the twisting turns of the Colorado and Green rivers defies our paltry imaginations. Up close and personal the land is surprisingly verdant, and its million colorful canyons will forever alter any preconceived notion you might harbor of what a desert is supposed to look like. Brown, flat and perennially parched it is not.

Though small and isolated, historic Bluff in extreme southeastern Utah was first settled by tough, persevering Mormon pioneers in 1880. Sleeping in the shadow of 300-foot sandstone bluffs along the elegant San Juan River, this quiet, polite community, like the hub of an old wagon wheel, lies at the center of stunning natural beauty that regularly draws outdoor adventurers and casual tourists in manageable numbers.

South and west of town is John Wayne country, the Navajo Nation’s incomparable Monument Valley. To the west, plunging Goosenecks canyon carved by the meandering turns of the San Juan beckons, and beyond those sharp bends are deep, inviting, long and narrow canyons named Slickhorn and Grand Gulch.

The American West is vanishing. Authentic old towns in attractive natural settings with strong ranch and mining heritages have succumbed in great number to theme park facelifts; refurbished cowboy and hard-rock miner motifs that pander to Hollywood’s notion of what the good old days must have looked like.

Quaint “western” makeovers of main street are invariably followed by boutiques and upscale eateries, the finest galleries and lavish lodging for the well-heeled. Affluent enclaves are close behind - the big second homes and block condominium complexes that crowd out the view and displace wildlife habitat as sprawl runs rampant like a festering case of smelly gangrene.

Nobel laureate Ernest Hemingway chose well when he bought a home outside Ketchum in Sun Valley in 1959, abandoning his beloved Cuba to Castro, along with 6,000 books, his motorboat the Pilar, the Finca Vigia and the sparkling blue Caribbean that ran warm and salty through his veins. A world traveler with discriminating tastes in the arts and the natural order, a rugged, brawling bookworm of a man drawn to high country his entire life, the aging Hemingway with his white beard and arsenal of firearms picked Idaho’s Ketchum and Sun Valley in the end, and for good reason.

Our literary genius of world-renown might have been plagued by a serious drinking problem and rapidly degenerating health, mental and physical, but he had enough sense to recognize the unique quality of this place. When Hemingway first set eyes on the land back in the 1930s it was little more than an outpost for the hardy tucked into the rugged fold of mountains extraordinaire boasting green meadows and deep forests that define the elevated, an alpine country awash in fresh air and dry sunshine and wild landscapes that continue to beckon - the beauty of it all.",http://canadafreepress.com/members/1/JohnTreadwellDunbar/377/P20,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
2660,3034,Labor Analyst: Members-Only Unions Would Be Answer in World Without Forced Dues,"Watchdog covers the release of CEI’s latest publication, “Supreme Court Can Strike a Victory for Worker Freedom in Janus Case.”

A free-market public policy think tank says public sector unions should embrace members-only unions to allow workers freedom of choice, rather than forcing government employees into a one-size-fits all union.

Competitive Enterprise Institute Labor Policy Analyst Trey Kovacs expects the U.S. Supreme Court will rule in favor of Mark Janus in his case challenging forced union fees to the AFSCME union. Janus, a child support specialist for the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services, says his First Amendment rights are being violated by being forced to associate with a union he doesn’t agree with. Unions contend he just wants a free ride.

Kovacs said in a report released Wednesday morning there’s a fix for that called members-only unions.

I realize this must be part of the vast conspiracy to keep breast cancer patients confused. Nancy, over at Nancy’s Point, blogged about the AJCC’s Updates to the Breast Cancer Staging System, asking if we are confused about it. Well, since I didn’t know about the updates (or even who the AJCC is) I was and still am very confused.

Let’s start with the AJCC or the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Apparently they are the people who set up cancer staging criteria. They set the original TNM staging system in 1959. TNM means Tumor size, Nodes positive, and Metastases.

“The panel recognized the need to incorporate biologic factors, such as tumor grade, proliferation rate, estrogen and progesterone receptor expression, human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) expression, and gene expression prognostic panels into the staging system. AJCC levels of evidence and guidelines for all tumor types were followed as much as possible. The panel felt that, to maintain worldwide value, the tumor staging system should remain based on TNM anatomic factors. However, the recognition of the prognostic influence of grade, hormone receptor expression, and HER2 amplification mandated their inclusion into the staging system.”

I used to know what stage I am – IIA. Now I can’t figure it out. With all this other stuff included. I am very confused. I looked at the American Cancer Society’s website for help. And I am even more confused. There is no more little chart that shows what you stage you are.

So here is my game plan: I will ignore all this new information until I meet with my oncologist sometime next summer and ask her. I feel this is better for more. A little ignorance and confusion will go a long way in reducing my stress.

Now all of us breast cancer people can have these little conversations:

‘What stage are you?’

‘IIa, I think.’

‘Is that the old staging or the new staging?’

‘ What new staging?’

‘You didn’t hear about it?’

‘No.’

All the breast cancer staging changed in 2018. They added all sorts of new information, grade, hormone status, etc’

‘Oh, so if I was stage IIb, do you know what new stage I am?’

‘No, I don’t even know what stage I am. I can’t figure it out. I’m going to ask my oncologist.’

‘Crap, let me call my oncologist too.’

But I swear there is a vast conspiracy out there to keep us all confused.

195,230,Family Pulls Out Camera To Prove How McDonald’s Purposely Tainted Their Sandwich,"All religions have rules for their followers to abide by. And while they make total sense to the people in the religion, those looking at it from the outside might not understand. One particular religious rule for Muslims that other people don’t usually understand is their refusal to eat pork. But according to the first amendment, people are free to practice any religion they choose. But now a Muslim family from the New York area who were visiting the Decatur, Alabama area decided to stop for a bite to eat at a McDonald’s.

When they got there, they placed an order for 14 sandwiches. They handed over their money. But when they bit into their sandwiches, they found the McDonald’s employees at that location had hidden bacon in the sandwiches – consuming pork product is a sin in Islam. Now McDonald’s is under fire for their treatment of their Muslim customers.

The family took photos of their tainted sandwiches and shared them online. Before long, the Council on American-Islamic Relations jumped on board and accused McDonald’s of intentionally serving the Muslim family bacon as a cruel prank.

“They started noticing it tasted different to them,” said Khaula Hadeed, head of the Alabama chapter of the CAIR. “They eat McChicken all the time at McDonald’s [in New York]. They knew what they ordered — they know what’s in the sandwich.”

Hadeed sees this as a purposeful attack on the Muslim family.

“It doesn’t sound like a mistake, especially on 14 sandwiches,” Hadeed said. He went on to call the cruel prank “an intentional act of religious and ethnic bigotry.”

Because this Alabama McDonald’s location violated the family’s religion, Hadeed is calling for a full-fledge investigation into the employees there. The problem was so sever that one of the adults who accidentally consumed the bacon vomited twice.

“They’re essentially disturbed about it,” she said. “McDonald’s should investigate this incident, identify and terminate the employees responsible, and take proactive steps to satisfy this American family’s concerns, starting with an apology.”

The bacon was hidden in the sandwich so the Muslim family would have no way of seeing it but to accidentally eat it.

“One of the kids opened one of the sandwiches and it had bacon it ― like a very small, chunk of bacon in there. They were really surprised and kind of horrified,” Hadeed told HuffPost. “They opened all of them and, lo and behold, all of them had a small of chunk of crudely torn bacon piece in them ― either underneath the patty or on top of it in a way where you wouldn’t see it.”

Alabama readers are outraged a McDonald’s location in their state would do this to a family.",http://awm.com/family-pulls-out-camera-to-prove-how-mcdonalds-purposely-tainted-their-sandwich-3/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

On 7 Sep 12, I lost my most faithful and loyal friend… My family dog, named Pringles.

Pringles was a Great Pyrenees dog. Pringles was 200 hundred pounds of pure white canine love, devotion, and doggone honest devotion to his Alpha Master, friend and owner. I loved this dog with all my heart, soul, mind and strength. A human knows not what happiness is, until owning a good dog.

Man’s world today is full of tyranny, evil, and epic proportions of untrustworthy events that speak of a coming apocalypse of national proportions. Yet, when I always went home after a day of hardship, toil, despair of the world tyranny and evil events that surround me and you in this world of today, I found it easy to put aside the world and evil doers, as soon as I saw my loyal canine friend, anxiously waiting for me, wagging his big white tail, when I drove into my country lane. At that moment, each and every day, I would thank God for my life, which was surrounded by the happiness of my dog.

Radical Left, open borders types shouldn’t be allowed to continue balkanizing our already-divided nation

Another win: Supreme Court okays Trump travel ban



This year has seen unprecedented — and unconstitutional — meddling in the decisions of a sitting president. Despite it all, President Trump has been able to sidestep and undermine much of this interference simply by enforcing current law. As a result, illegal immigration is down, the asylum program, which had become little more than an alternative form of immigration, is slowing as authorities check for attempted fraud, and refugee resettlement levels are lower because of Trump’s reduced annual caps. Meanwhile, President Trump patiently took the constitutional route of appealing the travel ban injunctions to the Supreme Court, confident that the justices would rule in his favor. Yesterday, in a 7-to-2 decision, the Supreme Court did just that, allowing Presidential Proclamation 9645, the third iteration of President Trump’s travel ban, to come fully into effect pending two legal challenges expected to be heard soon in the oft-overturned Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.

The Supremes should have made the lifting of the injunctions permanent. The law is clear: the president has the authority to ban anyone that he believes is dangerous to the U.S. Specifically, 8 U.S. Code §1182 (f) states: Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate. There were a total of three travel ban proposals. Appeals courts blocked all three. So the various courts’ mischief reveals how corrupt and far-reaching the Washington swamp is. Working on the Left’s behalf, the courts did all they could to stall and disrupt the Trump agenda. It is yet another reminder that “people are policy,” and if our constitutional republic is ever to be restored, a thorough house-cleaning at the federal, state, and local levels in all three branches of government is necessary. Furthermore, this moment in time — when the GOP controls both Congress and the White House — offers a unique opportunity to reform civil service employment law. As it stands, it is almost impossible to fire federal bureaucrats for anything. But President Trump has done significant work despite the swamp’s resistance. The prior travel bans set time limits. The latest ban, while reducing the total number of countries affected, does not. Immigrants and non-immigrants from Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen are banned from travel to the United States, with a few exceptions. Unfortunately, that largely excludes refugees.

The presidential memorandum states: This proclamation shall not apply to an individual who has been granted asylum by the United States, to a refugee who has already been admitted to the United States, or to an individual granted withholding of removal or protection under the Convention Against Torture. Nothing in this proclamation shall be construed to limit the ability of an individual to seek asylum, refugee status, withholding of removal, or protection under the Convention Against Torture, consistent with the laws of the United States. Despite refugees’ exclusion from the ban, the policies Trump has put in place are having an effect. For example, aggressively prosecuting asylum fraud and improving the vetting process for refugees, will bring down the overall refugee numbers, as fewer fakers will successfully get through, and fewer will risk trying. President Trump has set the refugee caps now at 45,000, a modest reduction from the past 17 years’ annual average of 60,000. Given that the resettlement industry saw rapidly increasing numbers during the Obama administration’s later years, however, left-wingers are now howling about these reductions. Refugee numbers are down substantially. During October 2017, the first month of federal fiscal year 2018, only 1,242 refugees were admitted to the U.S. In the same month last year, the Obama administration admitted 9,945. If the current rate is sustained, total resettlement for the fiscal year will be under 20,000. In FY 2017, the total was 53,716, down from FY 2016’s 84,995. But refugees are not the only foreigners being resettled. There are: asylum seekers (asylees); holders of special immigrant visas (SIV) given to Iraqis and Afghans who have assisted the U.S. military; victims of human trafficking; Cuban/Haitian Entrants; and those in the Unaccompanied Alien Children program (UAC). Overall, these numbers skyrocketed in President Obama’s last four years. Trump’s enforcement efforts are already bringing down the number of UACs, and should also reduce the numbers in the asylum and SIV programs, both of which have been vulnerable to significant amounts of fraud. President Trump took another action this week separately that hit the refugee advocates hard.

Continued below... He pulled the U.S. out of the Global Compact on Migration, a U.N. effort to control and encourage refugee resettlement. The Trump administration declared that the compact “contains numerous provisions that are inconsistent with US immigration and refugee policies and the Trump Administration’s immigration principles. As a result, President Trump determined that the United States would end its participation in the Compact process that aims to reach international consensus at the UN in 2018.” All of Trump’s actions are heartily welcome. What he has done, however, does not change the fundamental program. A future president — or even this president, if convinced by the swamp to do so — could turn around and ramp those numbers right back up again any time. The various refugee categories rely on 9 private contractors and about 320 subcontractors to do the actual resettlement work. And this is the part of the program that needs to change. It is an incestuous stew of corruption that sucks state and local officials into its orbit. Because they are paid by the head to resettle refugees, the contractors seek to maintain or increase refugee levels. They constantly lobby the government for more refugees. Many have been in the streets protesting — and even suing the government — since Trump took office. They ignore the complaints of local communities that bear the lion’s share of burdens refugees bring. Leaders of these organizations move in and out of government in a revolving door. They run the resettlement contractor for a few years, then move into a job at the State Department or HHS’s Office of Refugee Resettlement to oversee the program for a few years, then back again to the resettlement contractor. They are out for themselves, and all are radical Left, open borders types. They are motivated both by ideology and personal gain. They shouldn’t be allowed to continue balkanizing our already-divided nation.

766,873,BYE BYE BLACKBURN! White flight? Or is it white fright?,"Up to 95% of the residents in some areas of Blackburn are Muslim (or ‘Asian’ in British speak). It’s only a matter of time until Blackburn becomes an Islamic stare, proof that multiculturalism has been an abject failure. Muslim migrants refuse to assimilate, preferring to set up parallel communities (DIVIDE)…inevitably leading to white flight (CONQUER)…eventually turning the town into an Islamic hellhole (DOMINATE).

UK Express Blackburn has ranked as one of the most segregated town in Britain, where in the Whalley Range area 95 per cent of people are Muslim and a local butcher has admitted he has never served a white person in the whole of his time there.

Muslim families like to live in the same area as each other so we can support one another, but then the white people move out.

Retired taxi driver Ian Goodliffe, who previously worked at a ‘white only’ taxi firm, said: “There are certain areas where white people no longer go and the same for Muslims. They lead very separate lives. “There is an element of fear on both sides and then there is of course this awful racism. I hear it all the time.

“It is sometimes a gang mentality and everyone wants to stick to their own. There are whole parts of Blackburn where a white person would not buy a house but then there is the same for the Muslims. “There is a mutual distrust and the only way to change that is for people to mix, but we are at a total impasse and it is only going to get worse.”

Professor Cantle also said he met a Yorkshireman who said he was the first Muslim to move into a street and within three years all the white families had gone. He said: “Some of those families made no bones about it – they are moving out because ‘they’ are moving in.”

The study, conducted by integration experts Professor Cantle and Professor Eric Kaufman, has revealed that white and minority groups are now more isolated from each other than ever before – even though England as a whole is more ethnically mixed.

White populations in towns and cities where there has been a large influx of Muslim migrants have sunk to record lows – now less than 50% in the last decade alone, it has been revealed.

Polarization mainly occurs in urban areas, with some places in the UK seeing a decrease in the white population of more than 50 per cent between 1991 and 2011. Towns and cities, such as Birmingham, Leicester, Slough, Luton, Bradford and London have seen the “striking” decrease occur more rapidly than other parts of the UK, it has been claimed.

Academic Ted Cantle, a Government advisor on community adhesion, has warned the 2021 census will reveal polarization has got even greater.

Finally, politicians have admitted that to notice the scale of the immigration engineered by the last Labour government doesn’t make one racist. But neither is it wrong to discuss the cultural changes that large-scale immigration can cause. Six hundred thousand Londoners have left. They didn’t all sell ex-council houses in Barking, in order to purchase five-bedroom cliff-top villas in sunny Leigh-on-Sea.",http://barenakedislam.com/2018/01/24/bye-bye-blackburn-white-flight-or-is-it-white-fright/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
5728,6560,UN Study Says Ozone Layer Showing First Signs Of Recovery,"Source: www.themindunleashed.org | Original Post Date: September 13, 2014 –

According to a report published by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the ozone layer is on the track to recovery. The estimation results show that it has to do with political determination to phase out the production and use of ozone-depleting chemicals.

The ozone layer protects our planet from harmful ultraviolet radiation emitted by the Sun. Since 1985, when scientists discovered a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, there has been much effort to prevent its further decline by phasing out the use of ozone-depleting chemicals, which were widely used in different products, such as refrigerators and aerosols. In 1987, almost 200 countries ratified the Montreal Protocol, which banned the use of these substances.

According to UNEP scientists, the concentration of these substances in the atmosphere could have increased tenfold by 2050, if the Montreal Protocol had not been put into effect. At the same time, along with the protection of wildlife and agriculture, the protocol is estimated to have prevented 2 million cases of skin cancer by 2030.

“There are positive indications that the ozone layer is on track to recovery towards the middle of the century,” said UNEP Executive Director Achim Steiner. “The Montreal Protocol — one of the world’s most successful environmental treaties — has protected the stratospheric ozone layer and avoided enhanced UV radiation reaching the Earth’s surface.”

However, it cannot be said for sure if the ozone hole will completely recover by itself, since the ozone-depleting substances can remain in the atmosphere for years. Moreover, there still are other persistent environmental issues that contribute to global warming and climate change. In particular, WMO recently said that the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere had reached a record high.

The problem is that some chemicals that have replaced ozone-depleting substances are still potent greenhouse gases. New environment-friendly substitutes need to be found, and further actions need to be taken to stop the global warming and help recover the ozone layer to its 1980s condition. See Below:

As WMO Secretary-General Michel Jarraud said, “International action on the ozone layer is a major environmental success story. This should encourage us to display the same level of urgency and unity to tackle the even greater challenge of climate change.”

7346,8378,The Right to Resist Evil Leaders—The Christian History,"Do Americans have a right to oppose unjust authority? Given our history, this right goes without saying. You see, our country was founded by men resisting the unjust rule of Great Britain. More precisely, in one of history’s most famous recitations of the Right of Resistance, the American Declaration of Independence itself says,

It is the simple and straightforward opinion of many sincere Christians that God commands passive obedience to all authority. This would be based upon such passages as Romans 13:1-7 :

And yet, to many American Christians, part of the de facto religious majority—a straightforward reading of the Bible might suggest there can be no opposition to the established authority. In other words, true Believers are simply commanded to suffer wrongdoing in silence, and any evil will be judged later by God. Yet, were this true, even if a Hitler arose in America, there could be no Christian resistance. Further, had this been true during the American Revolution, the Founders would have been the evil-doers, while mad King George III would have been the more correct. Does the American church really embrace this position?

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.—That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,— That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.

Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and you will be commended. For the one in authority is God’s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for rulers do not bear the sword for no reason. They are God’s servants, agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer. Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also as a matter of conscience. This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God’s servants, who give their full time to governing. Give to everyone what you owe them: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.

But, if so—Americans could never stand against the evil misuse of authority in the States. But how can this possibly be accurate in a world where evil flourishes when not confronted? So, obviously this notion of good Christians simply taking abuse in resigned silence, no matter how bad the ruler, must be wrong.

But how did our intrepid forebears, being sincere and highly educated Christians, mount and justify revolutionary activities? By taking a deeper and more exhaustive examination of Scripture, as well as using history and common sense as their guides. In doing so, they created the biblical doctrine of Resistance Theory.

I. Early History of Resistance: Martin Luther

The foundations of Resistance Theory were laid during the Reformation (1517-1648). Of course, since time immemorial there have been sentiments to push-back against tyrants. For example, Julius Caesar was killed by members of the Roman senate for creating a tyranny, as immortalized in Shakespeare’s famous play. Such anger towards tyrants is caused because of the incredible destruction such regimes create, and their war against liberty. For example, while Julius’ adopted son, the Emperor Caesar Augustus oversaw one of history’s most peaceful reigns, later emperors were often ineffective, depraved, perverted and even mentally deranged.

The American Founders employed Calvinist Resistance Theory, although this was not ultimately derived from John Calvin, but Martin Luther, according to Quentin Skinner in The Foundations of Modern Political Thought, Vol. 2: The Age of Reformation. Originally, after the Reformation split, the Lutherans were content to simply work with the amenable Catholic German authorities. But around 1530, when these same Catholics suddenly decided to compel the Lutherans to rejoin the Church, Luther and the other leaders were in a quandary. So, they began to debate amongst themselves about their options.

Two theories emerged from these Lutheran discussions on how to resist evil rule. The first was a “private-law” argument based on the theory that everyone has a right to defend themselves against the menacing actions of other private citizens. Ingeniously, they claimed the bad ruler lowered himself to the level of a private citizen by doing evil acts. In doing this, they echoed the Conciliar Theory of the Catholics during the crisis of the Great Schism.

The second theory was a constitutional argument. Here, they argued that the seeming prohibition against resisting God-appointed authorities was countered by the fact that God does not call leaders to do bad acts. If “leaders” regularly do bad things, harming the state and the populace, this simply reveals that these are not men God has called to lead. Further, the term “authority” itself is not singular, but is composed of all the established magistrates. And therefore, to resist one does not mean to reject all authority, for a lesser magistrate can resist an evil, higher leader.

II. Magdeburg Confession

Magdburg is a small, ancient German city, over 1,200 years old, originally founded by Charlemagne. The Magdeburg Confession was a response to royal tyranny, and is considered the foundational document related to the Right of Resistance. It’s story emerged in the aftermath of Luther’s decision to leave the Catholic Church and start the Lutheran Church.

The Reformer’s theories on resistance were soon tested when German king Charles V demanded all Lutheran cities, including the Saxon town of Magdeburg, return to the Holy Roman Church in 1546, in the document called the Augsburg Interim. Magdeburg was a small town with a history of independent thinking and resiting tyranny. The Magdeburg Confession is similar to Luther’s Warning to His Dear German People, based upon his two-kingdom argument, which similarly prepared the Protestants of a coming religious war. The ministers published their Confession and Defense of the Pastors and Other Ministers of the Church of Magdeburg in April, 1550.

According to David M. Whitford in Tyranny and Resistance: The Magdeburg Confession and the Lutheran Tradition, the Magdeburg siege was a political and religious blunder for Charles V, as it caused the Protestant movement to gain sympathy and supporters. Further, it was a failure as a means of staunching anti-Catholic sentiments or political movements.

The Magdeburg Confession begins with these words:

If the high authority does not refrain from persecuting with force and injustice not only the persons of their subjects, but even more their rights under Divine and Natural Law, and if the high authority does not desist from suspending or eradicating true doctrine and true worship of God, then the lesser magistracy is required by God’s divine injunction to attempt, together with their subjects, to stand up, as far as possible, to such superiors.

The work of the Confession was authored by a number of resistant ministers. Writes Whitford,

...the pastors underlined a fundamental doctrine that supported their work: They referred, though not by name, to Luther’s doctrine of the two kingdoms. Their readers were to resist the current persecution, “each one in accordance with his calling and his ability.” The implication, to be repeated again and again in the body of the work, is that persons ought to work in their areas of competence and calling; lesser magistrates must resist, and pastors must admonish and preach.

The Confession is a complex document, which deals with the two-kingdoms of religious and secular authority. Matthew J. Trewhella, in The Doctrine of the Lesser Magistrates: A Proper Resistance to Tyranny and a Repudiation of Unlimited Obedience to Civil Government, explains the Magdeburg doctrine:

In their arguments, the pastors declare the idea of unlimited obedience to the State as ” an invention of the devil. ” They rightly assert that all authority is delegated from God. Therefore, if the one in authority makes commands contrary to the law or Word of God, those subject to his authority have both a right not to obey, and a duty to actively resist…no one in authority holds his authority autonomously. Rather it is delegated to them from God. If the authority therefore makes law which contravenes the law of God, those subject to their authority can refuse obedience because, as the pastors write, “divine laws necessarily trump human ones.”

The teaching here was that it was no rejection of the biblical doctrine of obeying authority, if lesser authorities—or “magistrates”—were encouraged to resist the bad deeds of higher rulers.

III. Doctrine of Lesser Magistrates

The Reformers, in their desire to be biblical, and yet still preserve their lives and movement, developed a nuanced definition of “authority.” In their theory, when the Bible described “authority,” the writers countenanced the entire gamut of various authorities in a society. The lesser posts were referred to as “magistracies.” So, for example—in ancient Rome, where there was either a consul in the Republic, or a later Emperor, their would be various lesser officials, or magistrates, such as aediles, praetors, or prefects. Or, consider in modern American, the many lesser magistracies, such as US and state senators and likewise congressmen, etc.

Trewhella here defines lesser magistrates:

The Magdeburg Confession is an important historical work because the pastors of Magdeburg were the first in the history of mankind to set forth in a doctrinal format what only later came to be known as the doctrine of the lesser magistrates…The lesser magistrate doctrine declares that when the superior or higher civil authority makes unjust/ immoral laws or decrees, the lesser or lower ranking civil authority has both a right and duty to refuse obedience to that superior authority. If necessary, the lesser authorities even have the right and obligation to actively resist the superior authority.

To the pastors of Magdeburg, all magistrates, higher and lower, possess delegated authority from God. Therefore, the lesser magistrates have a right and duty to oppose the superior magistrate-turned-tyrant when he makes laws contrary to the law and Word of God. This responsibility is both positive and negative. In other words, a magistrate has a duty to disobey the evil commands of a bad ruler, and help protect the at-risk subjects of the realm. But if the lesser magistrate does not resist, he himself becomes an instrument in the hand of the evil ruler, and therefore subject to the judgment and wrath of God.

Conclusion

The argument of the Madgeburg pastors was simple, yet revolutionary. If God creates all authority, from greater to lesser magistrates, then all authorities answer to him. Further, since God does not directly call anyone to do evil things, and therefore break his law, a bad ruler becomes just a simple private citizen.

And if a bad leader begins to oppress the people and do ungodly and monstrous deeds, it is up to the lesser magistrates to do what they can to resist and protect their people. In doing this, the magistrates are not acting illegally, but fulfilling God’s higher law by acting in love in the face of hate. Further, the fact that the lesser magistrates have the duty to resist evil, means that the private citizens would not have the right to revolt. This would keep the entire society from erupting into chaos and anarchy, a position the Lutherans worked hard to avoid in their theory.

2905,3330,9 Subtle Signs You Are Dealing With a Narcissist,"Sure, we know a lot of the more common and defining signs of narcissism, but there are a lot of signs that often go without being mentioned. Narcissists are quite picky and always want their way everything that they do stems from this.

Below you will find a list of signs that anyone who has ever been in a serious relationship with a narcissist or grown up in a narcissistic environment will know to be true. Narcissists are people who have an excessive interest in themselves and believe the world owes them something. These people are manipulative, unforgiving, and all around us.

9 Plain-to-See Signs That You Are Dealing With a Narcissist:

The narcissist does not take advice. You can tell them something time and time again, but it is not going to do any good. You are wasting your energy and your time.

2. They like to push your buttons.

Narcissists are always doing things to make you upset or angry. They love to push people’s buttons, and this is something they are very good at.

The narcissist does not ask for anything. He or she merely makes a demand and said demand is met. If someone is pushing you around, stop letting them. Cut them out of your life.

4. They do not think that any rules apply to them.

While the rules apply to everyone else, they do not apply to the narcissist. This is because the narcissist believes he or she is better than everyone else and therefore the rules normal people have to follow do not apply. Makes sense, right?

5. They are always dropping names.

The narcissist is a chronic name-dropper. He or she wants to make it seem like they are doing more than other people. This is in itself a form of self-promotion. They do whatever it takes to make themselves look good and the rest of the world look bad.

6. They are always dropping plans and changing their minds.

The narcissist will change his or her mind last minute and cancel plans for no reason. They do not care if they ruin your night or even your week. You do not matter and they don’t care if you like their excuse or not.

7. They always have to get their way.

The narcissist will not do well with being told no. He or she always has to get what they think they deserve. If the narcissist does not get his or her way all hell usually breaks loose on the down low. If you refuse to agree with them you won’t be around for long.

8. They react aggressively when they think they are being criticized.

The narcissist takes everything too personally. Even a minor suggestion is always blown out of proportion. They just cannot accept that they are sometimes wrong or doing something the hard way. They get worked up and lash out a lot of the time.

9. They do not know they are a narcissist.

Narcissists are not aware that they are narcissists. It is very hard and seemingly impossible to truly cure a narcissist. Cutting ties is your best option. You cannot fix other people, especially those people who will never acknowledge something is wrong.

2430,2783,Canada recalls coconut; same brand linked to U.S. outbreak,"Canada recalls coconut; same brand linked to U.S. outbreak

% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

Coconut Tree brand frozen, shredded coconut is under recall in Canada because of possible contamination with Salmonella. The same brand is under recall in the United States, where it is implicated in a Salmonella outbreak.

The same brand of frozen, shredded coconut that has been linked to a multistate outbreak of Salmonella in the United States is now under recall in Canada, as well as two other brands.

No illnesses have been confirmed in Canada in connection with the recalled coconut, according to a recall notice posted Wednesday evening by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA).

Green Field, top, and Captain’s Choice brands of frozen coconut are being recalled in Canada because of potential Salmonella contamination.

However, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a week ago that one person in Canada had been confirmed with an infection from one of the two outbreak strains of Salmonella that has sickened 25 people across nine states.

As of Wednesday night, neither Public Health Agency of Canada nor the British Columbia Department of Health had posted any information about the Canadian Salmonella case reported by the CDC.

Retailers in British Columbia definitely received shipments of the implicated coconut, according to the CFIA recall notice, and it could have been distributed nationwide.

The Canadian recall notice did not name any manufacturers or importers of the recalled coconut. Instead, the CFIA notice says, “industry is recalling” the frozen, shredded coconut.

“This recall was triggered by Canadian Food Inspection Agency test results,” the CFIA recall notice states. The agency did not indicate whether the testing was part of its regular random enforcement operations or prompted by the U.S. investigation.

Brands recalled in Canada are Green Field, Captain’s Choice and Coconut Tree. The Coconut Tree brand has been under recall in the United States since Jan. 3, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Specific products recalled in Canada

Brand Common Name Size Code(s) on Product UPC Green Field Frozen Shredded Young Coconut 227 g None – All packages sold up to and including Jan. 24 7 12190 99714 4 Captain’s Choice Shredded Coconut 454 g None – All packages sold up to and including Jan. 24 8 934791 920105 Captain’s Choice Shredded Young Coconut 227 g None – All packages sold up to and including Jan. 24 8 934791 920112 Coconut Tree Shredded Young Coconut 227 g None – All packages sold up to and including Jan. 24 7 79139 06522 7

Coconut Tree brand frozen, shredded coconut was recalled in the United States on Jan. 3 because of Salmonella contamination.

U.S. outbreak investigation

On Jan. 16, the U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention warned consumers against eating recalled Coconut Tree brand coconut, which Evershing International Trading Co. distributed to restaurants, grocery stores and other retail locations.

“Frozen shredded coconut can last for several months if kept frozen and may still be in retail stores or in people’s homes. CDC recommends that retailers not sell, restaurants not serve, and consumers not eat recalled Coconut Tree brand frozen shredded coconut,” the Jan. 16 warning said.

The Massachusetts Department of Public Health identified the outbreak in December 2017 while investigating a single case of Salmonella infection.

The outbreak began in May 2017 in the United States and could be ongoing. As of Jan. 12, the CDC had confirmed outbreak cases in nine states. The most recent U.S. victim’s symptoms began on Nov. 4. The confirmed outbreak serotypes are Salmonella I 4,[5],12:b:- and Salmonella Newport.

Advice to consumers

Consumers who have had the recalled coconut in their homes should wash and sanitize countertops as well as drawers or shelves in refrigerators or freezers where frozen shredded coconut was stored, according to the CDC.

Anyone who has eaten the recalled coconut, or foods or beverages made with it, and developed symptoms of Salmonella infection should immediately seek medical attention and tell their doctors about the possible exposure to the pathogen.

Most people infected with Salmonella develop symptoms within 12 to 72 hours after being exposed to the bacteria. Symptoms can include fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.

In severe cases, the infection can be fatal. Infants, young children, the elderly, pregnant women and those with weakened immune systems are at greatest risk.

I lost sleep over the comments on that last video. Why? Because I was disheartened to find that MANY people are STILL entrenched in this idea of defending a personality (even one who routinely acts immorally) rather than defending rock-solid, timeless principles…while condemning people on the OTHER side for doing the same dang thing!

Positioning oneself in a position supporting ANY personality, paints one into a corner of hypocrisy, inconsistency and immorality…EVERY time. Staying in the cult of personality GUARANTEES widespread division, which is EXACTLY what your masters want. Because they CAN’T rule you when you stand on principle. They can ONLY rule you when you take the side of THEIR puppets. Doesn’t matter the flavor, doesn’t matter the gender, statism (or authoritarianism…or the RIGHT to rule) is and will always be an IMMORAL fiction.



If I don’t have the MORAL RIGHT to RULE you and YOU don’t have the MORAL RIGHT to RULE me, then how can we delegate to another group (congress, the president, whoever) a “right” that we DON’T have. And if we CAN’T do that very simple thing, why are we acting like they have the right to rule us and we have the MORAL OBLIGATION to OBEY THEM??? (I say “moral” because if you DON’T obey them, the state views that as a “sin” punishable by fine, imprisonment or BOTH…or sometimes DEATH!

Once we get this out of our minds (this idea that ANYONE has the right to rule us and that we MUST OBEY) we will no longer send our sons and daughters to fight immoral wars of initiated aggression; we will no longer allow ourselves to be stolen from through the extortion practice called “taxation;” there will no longer be an incarceration-intending “drug war” (which is REALLY a war on peaceful people)…and on and on I could write.

And I believe reason, logic, truth and LOVE will seep into the hearts of those who are still RIGHT-flavored statists and LEFT-flavored statists.

I love all you guys…that is why I spend hours and hours every single day doing what I’m doing. Peace to all of you and your families.

612,694,Family Security Matters,"Why Professing Christ is Becoming a 'Hate Crime' in the West

January 25, 2018

What is the source of dhimmitude-which in many ways paralyzes responses to Islam-in the West?

First a definition: ""dhimmitude,"" which was coined by the late Christian president of Lebanon, Bashir Gemayel, and popularized by writer Bat Ye'or, is a neologism based on the Arabic word, dhimmi-that is, a non-Muslim (generally a Christian or Jew) who falls under Islamic rule and, as a price for maintaining his religion, accepts an inferior social standing. Simply put, the dhimmi must know his or her place and never rock the boat, including by seeking equal rights with Muslims.

While this is the classic and original manifestation of dhimmitude, a new and unprecedented form has arisen in the West: in the Muslim world, where might naturally makes right, Muslim majorities impose an inferior status onto non-Muslim minorities; but in the West, it is the West itself-or at least homegrown elements-that in certain fields impose an inferior status on a non-Muslim majority.

The question becomes, Why? Why would a stronger civilization impose the unjust and supremacist stipulations of a weaker, hostile civilization, onto itself, and thereby paralyze itself against that same hostile civilization?

The answer is evident in the words of an ancient strategy: ""The enemy of my enemy is my friend."" The Western elements that are forever protecting and empowering Islam, and which operate under various names-""Liberals,"" ""Leftists,"" ""Marxists,"" ""Progressives,"" ""Social Justice Warriors,"" etc.-ultimately care little about Islam; rather, Islam is for them a tool to combat their real and much closer enemy: Christianity, and the mores and civilization borne of it and culminating in the West.

This is evident everywhere and in a myriad of forms. Most recently, the British government ""refused to say whether telling people about the Christian faith could be a hate crime."" Lord Pearson of Rannoch, a UKIP peer, asked the House of Lords if they would ""confirm unequivocally that a Christian who says that Jesus is the only son of the one true God cannot be arrested for hate crime or any other offence, however much it may offend a Muslim or anyone of any other religion?"" Government spokesperson Baroness Vere of Norbiton responded by equivocating, saying that the legal definition of ""hate crime"" has been the same for the past 10 years.

But as Pearson explained in a later interview, the current definition of ""hate crime"" is subjective and revolves around whether the ""victim"" feels offended-thus leaving the door wide open to charging those who proclaim Christ and the Trinity of committing a hate crime, especially vis-à-vis Muslims, who adamantly object to the claim, as Pearson himself acknowledged: ""Certainly the stricter Muslims do feel offended by Christianity and our belief in Jesus being the only Son of the one true God.""

Pearson also pointed to a double standard in how ""hate crimes"" are applied: ""You can say what you like about the Virgin Birth, the miracles and the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, but as soon as you say ‘come on, is Islam really the religion of peace that it claims to be,' all hell breaks loose.""

Indeed, and there is a reason for that: unlike Islam-which many Western elite feel no (direct) connection to and thus no threat therefrom-Christianity is the faith of their forefathers; it is ever present in their societies, judging them-and they hate it for it. But rather than seek to suppress it openly, they operate indirectly, including by propping up always angry and easily ""offended"" Muslims against it, while they play the role of ""impartial"" secularist or progressive-people who will make themselves (meaning others, notably Christians) walk on eggshells lest the ""feelings"" of the ""other"" are hurt.

From here one understands why liberals and progressives who forever whine against any vestige of traditional (""oppressive"") Christianity habitually make common cause with Islam-despite the latter's truly oppressive qualities. Feminists denounce the Christian ""patriarchy""-but say little against the Muslim treatment of women as chattel; homosexuals denounce Christian bakeries-but say little against the Muslim execution of homosexuals; multiculturalists denounce Christians who refuse to suppress their faith, including by banning Christmas phrases and images, to accommodate the religious sensibilities of Muslim minorities-but say little against the entrenched and open Muslim persecution of Christians.

From here one understands the ultimate reason why domineering Western elements are imposing the unjust and stifling effects of dhimmitude on and thus making the West weak and vulnerable: ""The enemy [Islam] of my enemy [Christianity] is my friend."" As this most recent example from the UK shows, Muslims are now even being used to make the central claim of Christianity-which the progressive elite especially despise hearing as it convicts their godless lifestyle-a ""hate crime.""",http://www.familysecuritymatters.org/publications/detail/why-professing-christ-is-becoming-a-hate-crime-in-the-west,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

Republicans, especially those Party leaders who refused to support Trump and their foolish followers who failed to vote for him, will have no one to blame but themselves

Oh, to be a Democrat Now that the Donald is the Republican Nominee

The only thing the Republican Party leaders feared more than having Donald Trump become the party’s presidential nominee was having Ted Cruz become the Republican standard bearer. As the field narrowed it became clear that thanks to a compliant media that loved how their ratings soared when the Donald appeared on their networks, the nomination had become one for him to lose. As long as the media reveled in his outrageous pronouncements and continued to give him as much free air time as he wanted, wresting the nomination from him was going to be an uphill battle.

Only Ted Cruz stood between Trump and the nomination, but Cruz is anathema to the party’s leaders. John Boehner has called him Lucifer in the flesh. Mitch McConnell despises him; after all he had dared to call McConnell a liar, which happens to be the truth. To insure that Cruz would lose to Trump, John Kasich had to stay in the race. Every vote he received was a vote that might otherwise have gone to Ted Cruz. Splitting the anti-Trump votes between Cruz and Kasich insured that Cruz would lose. The minute Cruz realized it was over, Kasich, who never had the slightest chance of receiving the nomination, also dropped out. He had served his party’s interests. Instead of a dislikable conservative, the Republican Party will nominate an opportunistic egotist. The saving grace for the Party is that Trump’s negatives are only slightly greater than those of Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party’s presumptive nominee. He might actually beat her. But what if Hillary is not the Democratic nominee? Hillary Clinton is undoubtedly guilty of violations of the Espionage Act (18 U.S. Code, Section 793 (f)) which states in part that anyone “being entrusted with or having lawful possession or control of… any information, relating to the national defense, (1) through gross negligence permits the same to be removed from its proper place of custody or delivered to anyone in violation of his trust, or to be lost, stolen, abstracted, or destroyed…Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.”

She also has likely violated several public corruption statutes, so if you were Barack Obama who we are reliably informed has no love for the Clintons, what would you do? Would you let her become the party’s nominee, and possibly lose to Donald Trump in the general election, or to preserve your legacy and continue with the transformation of America that you have begun, would you want the Democratic nominee to be someone who the Donald didn’t have a snowballs chance in Hell of defeating? The Republicans will be blindsided when Obama gives the go ahead for Hillary to be indicted, or when to avoid her being indicted he lets her pretend that she or Bill has a medical emergency that requires her to drop out of the race. When Hillary is forced out of the race, the Democratic Party will turn to Biden. If he then chooses Elizabeth Warren as his running mate, which would keep both the Bernie and Hillary supporters from jumping ship, the Republicans will be sailing into a perfect storm: a 2016 election debacle reminiscent of the defeat it suffered in 1964 when Barry Goldwater was the nominee. The Republicans have 24 Senate seats up for reelection. The Democrats only need to pick up 5 seats to regain control of the Senate. If Biden becomes our next President and Harry Reid the next Senate majority Leader, the Supreme Court will be transformed into a liberal activist judicial bench for decades. Obamacare will never be repealed, our borders will not be secured, and the transformation of America that Obama started will continue unabated.

Continued below... Barack Obama has not been a successful president. Other than Obamacare, he has no legacy; no other domestic legislation to speak of, and no foreign policy accomplishments. A Republican President with both houses of Congress controlled by Republicans could repeal Obamacare thereby undoing Obama’s entire legacy. A Democratic President with a Democratic controlled Senate could turn Obama’s unfulfilled aspirations for our country into tomorrow’s stark realities, and if he does, the Republicans, especially those Party leaders who refused to support Trump and their foolish followers who failed to vote for him, will have no one to blame but themselves.

1373,1602,Dad Gives His Son A Christmas Toy That Speaks With Mom’s Voice Who Passed Away (video),"2017 was a very tough year for one family in Florida. After the boy’s mother passed away, Antonio Vargas Sr. from Orlando really wanted to help his son remember his beloved mother. So dad decided to create an extraordinary Christmas gift that his son would cherish for the rest of his life. So what did he do? Antonio Sr. decided to keep the voice of the boy’s deceased mother alive for a while longer by using her voice as the voice box inside the boy’s new stuffed monkey toy.

When Antonio Jr. opened up the present and heard the voice coming from within the monkey, he burst into tears of joy. He then holds the toy tight against him as he remembers the love he has for his mother.

The boy’s mother passed away in July of this year. And because dad had kept a few voice recordings of the boy’s mother talking to her “little monkey,” he knew that the perfect gift for Christmas would be a stuffed animal.

With the recordings on his phone, Antonio Sr. brought them to Build-A-Bear and asked them to help him create a memorable holiday for his son.

Because the little boy had not heard the voice of his mother since she tragically died on July 4, 2017, he was overjoyed to receive dad’s fantastic Christmas gift.

In the video included below, you’ll see dad creating the gift. And then it cuts to when the boy opens it on Christmas. When he hears his mother’s voice say, “I will always love you,” Antonio Jr. cries and holds it tightly against his body.

Just a few days before Christmas, Antonio and his son visited his mother’s grave. There, they placed a small, but beautiful, Christmas tree to commemorate her memory and celebrate Christmas with her.

When dad posted the wonderful video on Facebook, it quickly went viral. And he wrote the following:

“This is a real big touching moment as a parent prepping this monkey to have a heartbeat and to speak to my son, so that my son can hear his mother’s voice again. She passed away on 4th of July. We always called our son our little monkey. So on Christmas Day, his dream came true!!! I love my little man with all my heart. Daddy loves you.”

Whenever Antonio Jr. presses the stuffed monkey, it says one of the following phrases in his mother’s voice. The young boy hears mom say, “I love you to the world and back,” “Give me a big hug, I love you,” “I love you guys so much, and I will always love you” and “Tell him Mommy loves him.”

For anyone dealing with loss this holiday season, we hope this story can serve as a source of inspiration. This father knew exactly how to help his son deal with his grief all while giving him a way to remember his mother for the rest of his life.

With the technology available to us, making a bear like this is possible. And that’s a fantastic thing.

What is your reaction to this heartwarming Christmas gift?",http://awm.com/dad-gives-his-son-a-christmas-toy-that-speaks-with-moms-voice-who-passed-away-video/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

4148,4701,Why not more letters? – Baptist News Global,"November 22, 2017

Why not more letters?

To the editor:

For decades I read on a weekly basis the Virginia Baptist state newspaper, the Religious Herald. It was through the Herald that I kept up with state and national Baptist news.

One of my favorite sections was the Letters to the Editor. It was always interesting to read the opinions of others concerning the various issues of the day.

I know BNG has no control over whether or not people write, but the dearth of letters is disappointing. Ten letters in two years?

BNG writers have addressed a number of very important issues with some very thoughtful essays. (Some of which have been controversial in their own right.) Has this not stirred more than just 10 people to write? Just asking.

Then what are they coming for? They were supposed to be coming, or so we were told, to replace an aging workforce. But they’re not replacing it. They’re living off it. And what will happen after that? Eventually at least some Muslim groups in these countries will begin to demand the jizya from the kuffar, the payments that are due to the Muslims from non-Muslims as per Quranic command. Europe is either going to submit to Islam or be engulfed in a civil war that it brought upon itself and will be of its own making, in allowing sharia-adherent Muslims to establish parallel societies all over the continent.

“‘Even refugees with a university degree have an IQ of only 93,′” Voice of Europe, January 20, 2018:

The EU and mainstream media said Europe’s ageing population needed migrants to rejuvenate its workforce. If their statement was correct, then the results of the migrant crisis would’ve been great: Hundreds of thousands of migrant should have been gainfully employed by now. A lot of migrants don’t have the skills required to compete in Europe’s modern workforce The reality, however, is totally different. For example in Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands between 80 and 99 percent of migrants are unemployed after sometimes more than a year. A lot of migrants don’t have the skills required to compete in Europe’s modern workforce. But according to Professor Rindermann of the German University of Chemnitz there is also a problem of intelligence. Professor of Psychology Heiner Rindermann, already caused a minor controversy when he stated in Oktober [sic] 2015 that refugees (migrants) have a lower average intelligence than Germans and gave evidence for his claim. According to his study, refugees with university degrees had an average IQ of 93 in mathematical and abstract tasks; the same skill level as indigenous high school students. As a result, Professor Rindermann wrote in German magazine Focus: “The majority of immigrants from South-eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa do not have a high qualification profile.” Rindermann went on to claim that the often cited “language problem” is only partly to blame for this discrepancy and more important are weaknesses in basic skills. He adds that the problem is exacerbated by the “more frequent consanguineous marriages (i.e. first cousin marriages) in Muslim communities and in Africa with [their]corresponding impairments”. “These people will master the technical and cultural complexity of a modern country less successfully and risk making more cognitive errors in daily life”, Rindermann concluded. The findings of Rindermann were hard to swallow for the mainstream media and the left in general. Regardless of the facts, leftist member of parliament, Susanne Schaper, made the outrageous suggestion to the distinguished university professor that he should go back to school to learn how to express himself politically correctly. In a way, Ms Shaper admits that modern publicly funded education is one big indoctrination course….

1178,1368,‘I’m coming with a desert eagle .45!’ Man Admits to Cyberstalking Former Girlfriend and Associate of Hers,"ALABAMA – A Mountain Brook man pleaded guilty Monday in federal court to cyberstalking, including threatening to kill, a former girlfriend and a second woman associated with the woman he had dated, announced U.S. Attorney Jay E. Town and FBI Special Agent in Charge Johnnie Sharp Jr.

Stephen Lewis, 32, entered his guilty plea before U.S. District Judge Karon O. Bowdre to two counts of cyberstalking. His sentencing is scheduled May 30.

“Using Facebook, email and phone messages in a campaign to terrorize and control someone is a fiendish crime that must be punished,” Town said. “Thanks to the dedicated work of the FBI, this defendant is having to answer for the fear and emotional distress he inflicted on these women and their families.”

According to Lewis’ plea agreement with the government, he used text messages, emails and voicemails to threaten, harass and intimidate a woman who had ended their five-year dating relationship. His harassment and threats, which included references to the mass shooting in Las Vegas that killed 58 people and wounded more than 500, went on for at least 10 months in 2017 and he threatened his harassment would “continue forever.”

The second woman Lewis threatened and harassed was the girlfriend of his first victim’s brother, according to Lewis’ plea agreement. He used Facebook and text messages to threaten and intimidate his second victim, including threats to stalk and kill her and her minor daughter.

Among Lewis’ often profane Facebook messages to his second victim, he demanded to know where he could find his former girlfriend. “I have your phone number. I have your address. I know where [Victim-1’s brother] lives. I know where you live,” he wrote, according to his plea agreement. “You tell me where she is. You tell me whats (sic) going on. Or I’m coming with a desert eagle .45,” he wrote. Following that message, Lewis sent a photo of a Desert Eagle pistol to Victim 2.

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

Just when you thought things in the socialist South American utopia could not get any worse, The Guardian reports that a Venezuelan soldier is being held after opening fire on a group of citizens tussling over scarce meat and killing a pregnant teen.

Alexandra Colopoy was shot by First Sergeant David Rebolledo, according to a tweet by the state prosecutor late on Sunday night. No further details were provided, but critics of President Nicolás Maduro’s leftwing government seized on the incident, calling it a stark example of the oil-rich country’s meltdown.

“This is how the murderous regime treats the people,” opposition lawmaker Delsa Solorzano tweeted on Monday. “The sorrow of this man, whose wife and baby to be were killed by a bullet from the state, is Venezuela’s sorrow.”

Local media reported that Colopoy’s husband and a witness said the soldiers were drunk when they arrived at the queue for pork in a poor area of Caracas. They said the soldiers ordered the people waiting in line to move on because the traditional Christmas meat had run out, but they refused.

“The national guard went crazy and started firing,” Colopoy’s spouse Bernabé said in a filmed interview circulating on social media. “She fell to the ground,” he said, adding his wife was five months pregnant. His brother Alejandro was also shot, but was recovering, he said.

Prosecutor Tarek Saab condemned the incident.

“The Venezuelan state guarantees the respect and application of human rights, as well as sanctions for those who violate them,” he tweeted.

Food riots and rowdy queues in front of supermarkets have become frequent in Venezuela.

But that will all be solved soon, according to President Maduro, as he introduces the ‘Petro’ – a cryptocurrency backed by gold and oil.

""We meet at Christmas in New York... soon""

We All Live in Bangladesh Now



Akayed Ullah, a Bangladeshi Muslim living in Brooklyn, really hated Christmas. He hated Christmas so much that he used Christmas tree lights (along with a battery and some wire) as a trigger for a pipe bomb. He filled the pipe bomb with screws so that when it went off, metal shrapnel would tear bloody holes through morning commuters in Manhattan. Wearing a hooded jacket and a backpack to cover the pipe bomb strapped to his body, Ullah got on the F Train at the 18th Avenue elevated subway station off Little Bangladesh. Like the Duke Ellington song says, he switched over to the A Train at Jay Street. It was early morning, but there were plenty of people riding the train. Jay Street is a major transit hub. But Ullah was waiting to blow up somewhere else. He got off in the crush at the 42nd-St. Port Authority station. Here a whole lot of people can be found rushing up and down crowded staircases and shoving their way through cramped corridors.

Ullah didn’t actually like diversity. He didn’t want to share a city or country with Christians Ullah took the long underground corridor that runs between the Port Authority station and Times Square. He strode past movie and beauty ads. He walked under the discouraging poem, “Overslept, So tired, If late, Get fired, Why bother? Why the pain? Just go home. Do it again.” But he wasn’t going home. And there would be no opportunities to do it again. The Muslim terrorist was right on time. Rush hour was just getting started in the city that never sleeps. The Muslim terrorist probably passed hundreds of people: not to mention a saxophonist or drummer trying out his act on tired commuters. But he was waiting for something else. Finally he saw it. A Christmas poster. That’s when he detonated the pipe bomb using a Christmas tree light near a Christmas poster. Because if there was one thing that Akayed Ullah, like his ISIS masters truly hated, it was Christmas. Last month, ISIS supporters had circulated a poorly photoshopped poster of Santa next to a box of dynamite overlooking Times Square. “We meet at Christmas in New York… soon,” it read. As he walked toward Times Square, Ullah appeared determined to carry out the ISIS threat. Using a Christmas tree light in his bomb and detonating near a Christmas poster was a clear statement. Ullah came to this country in 2011. Three years later, he had already been ‘radicalized’. The Bangladeshi terrorist had come here on a chain migration link that began with a diversity lottery visa. But Ullah didn’t actually like diversity. He didn’t want to share a city or country with Christians.

But these days that’s not just Christmas in Bangladesh. It’s Christmas in Europe. And so he set out to kill them. In Ullah’s native Bangladesh, Christian churches have shut down midnight mass before due to threats of violence. “This is the first time in my life that I find Christians celebrating Christmas with such panic and fear,” the Bangladesh Christian Association secretary general had said. But with the diversity visa lottery, you don’t have to be a Christian living in Bangladesh to be terrorized by Bangladeshi Muslim violence. And maybe that’s a diversity we could do without. That same year, Bangladeshi authorities stopped a Christmas Day plot that involves a suicide bomb vest. But this year, America had its very own Bangladeshi suicide bomber. Christians are readying to celebrate Christmas in Bangladeshi churches this year with metal detectors and thousands of security personnel. But these days that’s not just Christmas in Bangladesh. It’s Christmas in Europe. Bangladeshi immigration means that we all live in Bangladesh now. Pakistani migration means we all live in Pakistan. Iraqi migration means that to a certain degree we all live in Iraq.

Continued below... An estimated 29 ‘lone wolves’ were arrested last year in Christmas terror plots in the UK, France, Brussels and Australia Muslim Christmas violence spread terror across Europe last year. These ranged from the ‘Kindergarten bomber’, a 12-year-old Iraqi who planted a nail bomb in a German Christmas market to the Tunisian refugee who rammed a truck into another German Christmas market killing 12 people and wounding 68. These days, German Christmas markets come with car barriers that are gift wrapped with bows. An estimated 29 ‘lone wolves’ were arrested last year in Christmas terror plots in the UK, France, Brussels and Australia. A number of these plots targeted Christmas markets, carnivals and cathedrals. The year before, a Pakistani married couple had opened fire at a Christmas party at the Department of Public Health in San Bernardino. The worst half of the couple had groused about the Christmas decorations. Previous attack plots had included the Christmas Day bomber (the Nigerian terrorist also known as the underwear bomber) and Portland’s Somali Christmas tree lighting bomb plot. This is what a religious war looks like. Muslim violence spikes around Ramadan, and around Christian and Jewish holidays, because Islamic violence is inherently religious in nature. Islamic Supremacist terrorists like Ullah are lashing out at non-Islamic religions in order to clear the way for the imposition of Islamic rule. Mayor Bill de Blasio, the lefty pol who dismantled the NYPD’s counterterrorism programs at the behest of Islamist pressure groups, insisted at the post-attack press conference that, “We actually show that society of many faiths and many backgrounds can work.” A society of many faiths can work. As long as all of them practice mutual tolerance.

You can’t coexist with people who refuse to coexist with you When a society includes Akayed Ullah, Sayfullo Saipov, the Uzbeki Muslim who ran over tourists on a Manhattan bike path in October, Ahmad Khan Rahimi, the Afghan who set off bombs in New York and New Jersey last year, Faisal Shahzad, the Pakistani who tried to detonate a car bomb in Times Square, Talha Haroon, another Pakistani who wanted to massacre New Yorkers in Times Square, Quazi Mohammad, another Bangladeshi who wanted to bomb the Federal Reserve and Raees Qazi, another Pakistani who scouted Times Square for an attack, that society can’t and won’t work. You can’t coexist with people who refuse to coexist with you. They’re just ticking time bombs. Like Ullah riding the F Train and then the A Train while the passengers around him unthinkingly played games or clicked through Trump headlines not knowing that he could have detonated the bomb at any moment. There are plenty of Ullahs all around us. Sometimes they wait years before blowing up. Other times hours and minutes. If we’re unlucky, it’s seconds. But the bombs, real and metaphorical, are there. This is life in a society that has opened its borders to migrants from Islamic states where terrorism isn’t a horrifying aberration, but an ancient religious tradition to which the penitent sinner may turn to when his life no longer seems to have purpose or meaning. This is how we live now. And it will get worse. Our politicians tout diversity after every attack. They tell us how much it enriches and improves us. Akayed Ullah was a livery cab driver. His predecessor, Sayfullo Saipov, was an Uber driver. Do we really need two cab drivers so badly that we have to accept eight deaths and sixteen injuries in exchange?

Continued below... We need to hurry because the Ullahs of tomorrow are applying for their visas today Could we get our cab drivers from somewhere beyond Bangladesh and Uzbekistan? We don’t have to live like this. We’re only living like this because we’ve been told that it would be mean and unfair of us to actually have a common sense immigration policy that keeps Islamic terrorists out. The question is would we rather be mean to the Uber drivers of tomorrow or sit next to a ticking time bomb waiting to detonate at the first sight of a Christmas poster? We’ve been told often enough that a common sense travel ban would violate religious freedom. But the greatest violation of religious freedom isn’t a selective immigration policy, it’s being murdered for your religion. That’s not just the reality in Bangladesh. It’s now the reality in America and Europe. The diversity visa lottery has brought us the wrong kind of diversity. Our cities have become a diverse assortment of immigrants who will and won’t kill you over your religion. There isn’t much religious diversity in Bangladesh, Pakistan or Afghanistan. If we want to preserve our own religious diversity from going the same way, we have to exclude those immigrants who would kill anyone who is different. And we need to hurry because the Ullahs of tomorrow are applying for their visas today.

The individual and his future

The Individual under attack

Jon Rappoport

(To read about Jon’s mega-collection, Exit From The Matrix, click here.) “It’s instructive to read what authors wrote about core values a hundred or two hundred years ago, because then you can appreciate what has happened to the culture of a nation. You can grasp the enormous influence of planned propaganda, which changes minds, builds new consensus, and exiles certain disruptive thinkers to the margins of society. You can see what has been painted over, with great intent, in order to promote tyranny that proclaims a greater good for all.” —(The Underground, Jon Rappoport) Here I present several statements about the individual, written in 19th century America. The authors, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, and James Fenimore Cooper were prominent figures. Emerson, in his time, was the most famous.

“All greatness of character is dependent on individuality. The man who has no other existence than that which he partakes in common with all around him, will never have any other than an existence of mediocrity.”— James Fenimore Cooper “The less government we have, the better, - the fewer laws, and the less confided power. The antidote to this abuse of [by] formal Government, is, the influence of private character, the growth of the Individual.” —Ralph Waldo Emerson “The former generations…sacrificed uniformly the citizen to the State. The modern mind believed that the nation existed for the individual, for the guardianship and education of every man. This idea, roughly written in revolutions and national movements, in the mind of the philosopher had far more precision; the individual is the world.”—Ralph Waldo Emerson “If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away.”—Henry David Thoreau

“They [conformists] think society wiser than their soul, and know not that one soul, and their soul, is wiser than the whole world…Society everywhere is in conspiracy against the manhood of every one of its members….Whoso would be a man, must be a nonconformist…. Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind.”—Ralph Waldo Emerson



Can you imagine, today, any of these statements gaining traction in the public mind, much less the mainstream media?



Immediately, there would be virulent pushback, on the grounds that unfettered individualism equals brutal greed, equals (hated) capitalism, equals inhumane indifference to the plight of the less fortunate, equals callous disregard for the needs of the group.



The 19th-century men who wrote those assertions would be viewed with hostile suspicion, as potential criminals, as potential “anti-government” outliers who should go on a list. They might have terrorist tendencies.



Contemporary analysis of the individual goes much further than this.



Case in point: Peter Collero, of the department of sociology, Western Oregon University, has written a book titled: The Myth of Individualism: How Social Forces Shape Our Lives:



Continued below... The Myth of Individualism: How Social Forces Shape Our Lives “Most people today believe that an individual is a person with an independent and distinct identification. This, however, is a myth.” Callero is claiming there aren’t individuals to begin with. They’re a group. This downgrading of the individual human spirit is remarkable, but it is not the exception. There are many, many people today who would agree (without comprehending what they are talking about) that the individual does not exist. They would agree because, to take the opposite position would set them on a path toward admitting that each individual has independent power—-and thus they would violate a sacred proscription of political correctness. These are the extreme conformists Emerson was referring to a century and a half ago. Unable to partake in anything resembling clear thought, such people salute the flag of the Collective, blithely assuming it means “whatever is best for everyone.” Such questions as “who defines ‘best’” and “who engineers this outcome” are beyond their capacity to consider. They rest their proud case in vagueness. Without realizing it, they are tools of a program. They’re foot soldiers in a ceaseless campaign to promote collectivism (dictatorship from the top) under the guise of equality. Let me repeat one of Emerson’s statements: “The antidote to this abuse of [by] formal Government, is, the influence of private character, the growth of the Individual.” The corollary: If there is no widespread growth of individuals and their independent thoughts, actions, and moral consciousness, if they don’t widen their horizons and spheres of influence, then in the long run what check is there on government? Demeaning the individual is, in fact, an intentional operation designed to keep government power intact and expand its range. Consider this question: If all opposition to overbearing, intrusive, and illegitimate government were contained in organized groups, and if there were no independent “Emersonian” individuals, what would be the outcome? In the long term, those groups would stagnate and fail in their missions. They would be co-opted by government. Eventually, all such groups would be viewed as “special needs” cases, requiring “intervention” to “help them.” That is a future without promise, without reason, without imagination, without life-force. That is why the individual remains vital; above, beyond, and through any blizzard of propaganda. “Art is individualism, and individualism is a disturbing and disintegrating force. There lies its immense value. For what it seeks is to disturb monotony of type, slavery of custom, tyranny of habit, and the reduction of man to the level of a machine.”— Oscar Wilde.

7723,8780,Embracing Racism,"Am I a racist? I never thought so. But lately, those on the left have been redefining racism, just as they have been redefining our Constitution and American institutions. According to them, I guess I am now a racist. We cannot stop the radical and irresponsible charges of racism coming from the left, but we can dilute them.

If you objected to the TARP bailouts, you were not considered a racist. But if you object to the Stimulus bailouts, then you are a racist. What’s the difference? If you object to the government takeover of private banks, that qualifies you as a racist. And if you complain about the government takeover of the auto industry then you are certainly a racist.

You say you don’t want a Cap and Trade law that will kill the traditional energy industry and double your utility bills and costs of living? That earns you a racist badge. And now you want to object to government run healthcare? Well, under the new definition, you are obviously a diehard racist.

Do you support or attend tea parties or participate in pro-constitutional rallies? You guessed it, you’re a racist, maybe even a Nazi according to some on the left! Do you watch Fox News or listen to conservative talk radio? You might as well just admit it, you’re a hopeless racist.

If all this make me a racist, then I guess I’m a racist, and proud of it. The left has tried to redefine conservatism as “racism” but the facts don’t bear that out. The history of racism in America has predominately always been in the Democrat party, from the days of slavery right up to the present.

Rep. Joe Wilson correctly called Obama a liar when Obama was lying about his healthcare plan. Obama doesn’t have a healthcare plan, but Congress has a number of discombobulated pieces of something they call a healthcare plan written by their special interest groups. Wilson was called a racist because he opposed these plans and called Obama on his lies. The fringe media (formerly mainstream media) tried to smear Wilson for a week until they had used up all of the hate rhetoric posted on the liberal blogs.

Instead of trying to be politically correct, let’s be honest for a change. People are naturally drawn to their own kind; it’s human nature and perfectly natural - unless you happen to be like Obama’s mother, Stanley Ann Dunham. But she was the exception, not the norm.

People want to gather with other people with whom they share things in common - like ethnicity, culture, music, language, and personal history. This is natural. Whites do it. Blacks do it. Hispanics do it. Asians do it. There is nothing wrong with that. People have the right to discriminate in their lives, that is called freedom of choice. There are always going to be certain ethnic groups that individuals will favor or disfavor because that is human nature and a matter of personal choice.

The government cannot legislate human nature, although the left continues to try with political correctness and experiments in social engineering. When that doesn’t work they resort to smearing anyone who doesn’t drink the Kool-Aid. We see this tactic constantly from the left, but rarely from the right. Maybe that is because conservatives are not followers of Marx and Alinsky who taught these tactics and how to use them. Nor are they followers of Barack Obama and other community organizers who promote and capitalize on racism within the black communities.

Is ACORN a racist organization? ACORN is Obama and Obama is ACORN. When does ACORN ever reach out to white people except when it’s to help them set up a brothel with illegal, underage girls and avoid paying taxes on the income, or to register people to vote Democrat whether they are alive or dead?

So does that make Obama a racist? I don’t know. Is his close friend and pastor, Jeremiah Wright a racist for blaming everything that‘s wrong in the black community on whites? What I do know is that throughout his entire campaign, Obama’s words were directed at black people and unions, as well as low income whites who didn’t see through it, when he talked of hope and change, and redistribution of wealth. Blacks knew exactly what he was talking about but whites remained a little confused.

He blames the successful and productive whites for creating wealth through capitalism and thinks they should be punished for it. His policies are designed to benefit 3 groups of people: blacks, environmentalists, and unions, at the expense of those who have benefited from capitalism and their own hard work. You can put those in any order you see fit, but the one thing they all have in common is Marxist socialism.

What is racism? The dictionary defines it as: The belief that race accounts for differences in human character or ability and that a particular race is superior to others; hatred or intolerance of another race or other races. Few in our society today hold these beliefs. We tend to judge people on the content of their character and accomplishments, not the color of their skin.

An expression of racism is when someone intentionally tries to hurt those of another race with hateful words or deeds that demean and belittle them because of their skin color and nothing more. These words and acts are extremely rare today and were primarily engaged in by the Ku Klux Klan, but you would never know it by listening to talking heads in the fringe media or the Democrat party. Racism now means any opposition to Obama and his Marxist policies, according to them.

Race is one of the main reasons that Obama was thrust into the White House by the Marxist machine that ran his campaign, so that any criticism of his policies could be painted as racism to shut up the opposition. Don‘t allow yourself to become a victim of this tactic. Don’t be fooled by it, and don’t be afraid of being called “racist.” You know if you are a racist or not, not the name callers.

Let’s just call every choice and preference we make in our lives “racism” and insist that we have the right to discriminate in who we like and who we don’t like - based on culture and character, not the skin color. The more commonplace “racism” becomes, the less it will be taken seriously. We all need to become immune to being called “racist” and throw it right back in the faces of those who would use this tactic for political advantage.

Most of us feel uneasy about Islamists living in America. Not because of how they look, but because of their culture and belief system which is incompatible with American laws and way of life. We all, to some extent, worry that Muslims gathering in Mosques in America may be involved with terrorist cells.

Does that mean that we are all racist against Muslims? If that is considered racist, then isn’t that “racism” justified by the deaths of 3000 of our citizens? Skin color aside, there are other reasons for disliking some people.

Muslims are free to practice their religion in America but there is a difference between religion and Islamic laws that have no place in America. I don’t care if you choose to worship in a Mosque, but leave your Islamic laws and culture in the Islamic country you came from and try to be an American.

Remember that we have God, the Constitution, and American history on our side when we defend our rights to freedom and liberty. That history includes the freeing of slaves and the Civil Rights Act. It also includes our 1st Amendment right to freedom of speech and expression and our right to discriminate between what we like and what we don‘t like. We have grassroots protests from millions in the silent majority who have finally found their voices.

What does the left have on their side? They have unions and ACORN, and the criminal element in society. They have their dishonest smear tactics, their childish name calling, and their lies. They have the communist teachings of Karl Marx and Saul Alinsky. And they have the racism against whites that has been bred into the black communities by people like Jeremiah Wright and Barack Obama, and groups like ACORN and Organizing For America.

Stand up for what you believe in and don’t let them intimidate you with their false accusations of racism. Hit back with your constitutional rights to discriminate in your personal life and make your own personal choices. After all, that is all the word “discriminate” really means. Let them know how absurd they really are for making claims of racism simply because you oppose socialism and communism along with the people who promote it.

If they want to label you a “racist” for being discriminating in your choices and political decisions, then wear that badge proudly. I know I do.",http://canadafreepress.com/article/embracing-racism,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

For all the obvious reasons, the Republican party gets most of the attention these days. For starters, it controls the White House, the Senate, and the House, and the party in power always warrants more scrutiny, even when it’s operating smoothly.

The Democratic party, meanwhile, has gotten drunk on the spectacle.

Of course, that’s not happening.

The GOP is running as smoothly as a dry Slip ’N Slide made from sandpaper. That the party is as dysfunctional as the human-resources department at the Weinstein Company stems from a host of ideological, political, and structural problems that are only compounded by the fact that the president grabs the public’s attention like a spider monkey running through a church with a lit stick of dynamite.

The Democratic party, meanwhile, has gotten drunk on the spectacle. And as with many a drunk, it’s grown oblivious to its own decrepitude. Like a bitter lush sitting in his own filth amid a sea of empty bottles, moldering pizza boxes, and fried-chicken bones, it shouts at the TV and boasts how it could do better.

Democrat Dysfunction

Donna Brazile, the longtime high-ranking Democratic functionary, was made interim chair of the party shortly before the 2016 election in the wake of revelations that the previous chair, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, seemed to be playing favorites in the primaries, tilting the scales toward Hillary Clinton and against Bernie Sanders. In an excerpt from her forthcoming book, Hacks, Brazile reports that Wasserman Schultz wasn’t simply partial toward Clinton. She was in fact Clinton’s vassal.

Team Clinton mocked Sanders as a paranoid dotard. As it happens, his paranoia didn’t go far enough.

It’s widely known that Barack Obama left the Democratic party in shambles. On his watch, the party lost more than 1,000 elective offices at the federal, state, and local levels. One underreported reason for this is that Obama opted to create a parallel institution out of his 2012 campaign outfit, Organizing for America. The renamed Organizing for Action siphoned money and the president’s energies from the DNC.

Brazile reports that the party was so hollowed out with debt that Hillary Clinton essentially scooped it up in a distress sale. Wasserman Schultz cut a deal with the Clinton campaign in which Clinton would raise millions ostensibly for the party, particularly at the state level. But those funds were sluiced back into the Clinton campaign coffers in Brooklyn, and the campaign extracted de facto control of the party’s messaging and hiring. Team Clinton mocked Sanders as a paranoid dotard for claiming that the Democratic primary system was rigged against him. As it happens, his paranoia didn’t go far enough.

It seems axiomatic that any party weak enough to be taken over by Hillary Clinton is not in good health.

Party Principles

Today, the Democratic party’s sole unifying principle is opposition to Donald Trump. Given Trump’s standing in the polls, that may be good enough for the 2018 midterm elections. But when it comes to ideas about governing, all of the passion is reserved for two things.

First, there is Sanders’ idea of “socialism,” which is really an unworkable stew of banalities and nostrums stemming from a nostalgic idea of a “Scandinavian model” that no longer exists (if it ever did). It’s as if Fabian socialists created an Epcot Center exhibit of Sweden in the 1950s, and irascible tour guide Bernie rides by in a trolley, shouting: “This could be us!”

The second source of passion is the angry, sanctimony-besotted identity politics popular on college campuses and a handful of left-wing websites. The DNC’s data-services manager recently sent out an email soliciting applications for new hires in the IT department. She cautioned that she wasn’t looking for any “cisgender straight white males.”

Like two pugilists leaning on each other in the 12th round, if one falls, the other may well fall too.

If you want to know how Trump was elected, ask yourself how a laid-off, cisgender, straight, white, male coal miner who went back to community college to learn computers might react to that.

Punch-Drunk Politics

Again, you wouldn’t be crazy for thinking the GOP is like a runaway fire at a soiled-diaper-reclamation center. And I’m sure I’ll have opportunities in the near future to expand on that.

But the important point is that dysfunction isn’t zero-sum. Right now, the best argument Republicans have is “we’re not Democrats,” and the best argument Democrats have is “we’re not Republicans.” Like two punch-drunk pugilists leaning on each other in the twelfth round, if one falls, the other may well fall too.

Everywhere else in America today, disrupters – Uber, Amazon, etc. – are dismantling established institutions. Perhaps both political parties are the next institutions to crumble under creative destruction. Or maybe not. But if it happens, no one can say they didn’t have it coming.

6468,7406,BOYCOTT ESPN,"Subscribe to Canada Free Press for FREE

The ESPN of today is a poor imitation of the network that was a cable television trailblazer. Sadly, it turned to liberal advocacy and decided to insult viewers of different political viewpoints

BOYCOTT ESPN

In a hectic world, millions of Americans enjoy the pastime of watching football on the weekends. It is a nice distraction from the pressures of everyday life. Unfortunately, it is becoming more difficult to just enjoy a game any longer as, sadly, politics has entered the world of sports in a big way. This season, NFL players are continuing to protest police brutality and racial discrimination by sitting, kneeling or giving a “black power” salute during the National Anthem. This has infuriated patriotic Americans who view these protests as disrespectful toward their country. It is no doubt a contributing factor toward the declining ratings of the NFL this season. As NFL ratings have deteriorated, one television network that is particularly suffering is ESPN. In the heyday of cable television, ESPN was considered one of the star networks. It featured great sports programming, compelling hosts and powerful interviews with athletes.

Unfortunately, in recent years, the network has turned away from strictly sports programming and transformed into a bastion of political correctness. Several weeks ago, the network made the asinine decision to remove Robert Lee, an Asian, from his position as broadcaster of a University of Virginia football game. The geniuses at the network believed that the broadcaster would be ridiculed for sharing the same name as, Heaven forbid, Confederate general Robert E. Lee. Instead, it was ESPN that was universally mocked for believing such a ridiculous move “felt right.” This week a new controversy has engulfed the troubled network. One of their daily show hosts, Jemele Hill, launched a nasty Twitter tirade against President Trump labeling him a “white supremacist,” an “idiot,” and a “moron.” For good measure, she also claimed that those surrounding the President, presumably including African American HUD Secretary Dr. Ben Carson, were also white supremacists. After an outcry, the network met with Hill and released a weak statement calling her comments “inappropriate.” She was not suspended, fired or even censured. In fact, Hill did not even apologize for her outrageous and inaccurate comments. In a statement Hill only expressed “regret” that her comments “painted ESPN in an unfair light.” On Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders stated that Hill’s remarks were a “fireable” offense. On Friday, in response to additional questions on the topic, Huckabee Sanders noted that ESPN is very inconsistent in how it treats their personalities who make political statements. In 2016, former Boston Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling, was fired by ESPN for an online post protesting laws allowing transgender individuals the right to use the bathrooms of their choice.

Thus, at ESPN, a conservative sports commentator was fired for expressing his political views on social media, whereas a liberal host was allowed to viciously insult the President and his advisers and retain her high paying position. This type of bias is certainly understood by ESPN viewers and is surely one reason why millions of Americans are “cutting the cord.” In a Fox News interview, Schilling labeled Hill a “racist” and said that ESPN and its parent company, Disney, support “liberal racism.” Clearly Schilling is right and the President agrees as well. On Friday morning, he tweeted that ESPN was “paying a really big price” for their liberal political views. He also noted that customers were “dumping” ESPN in massive numbers and demanded that the network “apologize” for the “untruth” of calling him a white supremacist. This criticism fell on deaf ears at ESPN, which did nothing. Hill continues to host her show and the network’s liberal bias will not be changing anytime soon. As a result, it is time for more Americans to boycott the network. If people want political commentary, there are much better networks to watch than ESPN. While those looking for strictly sports programming will have to switch channels as well. The ESPN of today is a poor imitation of the network that was a cable television trailblazer. Sadly, it turned to liberal advocacy and decided to insult viewers of different political viewpoints. Ideally, ESPN should offer viewers an escape from ongoing political debates. The network should be solely focused on sports coverage. Until ESPN returns to its core mission, the reason for its existence in the first place, viewers should stay away.

Amnesty International Is Barking Up The Wrong Tree

Paul Craig Roberts

I have received a letter from Margaret Huang, Amnesty International’s executive director. She is fundraising on the basis of President Trump’s “chilling disregard for our cherished human rights” and his exploitation of “hatred, misogyny, racism and zenophobia,” by which he has “emboldened and empowered the most violent segments of our society.”

Considering the hostility of Identity Politics toward Trump, one can understand why Ms. Huang frames her fundraiser in this way, but are the Trump deplorables the most empowered and violent segments of our society or is it the security agencies, the police, the neoconservatives, the presstitute media, and the Republican and Democratic parties?

John Kiriakou, Ray McGovern, Philip Giraldi, Edward Snowden, and others inform us that it is their former employers, the security agencies, that are empowered by unaccountability and violent by intent. Certainly the security agencies are emboldened by everything they have gotten away with, including their conspiracy to destroy President Trump with their orchestration known as Russiagate.

The violence that the US government has committed against humanity since the Clinton regime attacked Serbia was not committed by Trump deplorables. The violence that has destroyed in whole or part eight countries, murdering, maiming, and displacing millions of peoples, was committed by the Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama regimes, their secretaries of state such as Hillary Clinton, their national security advisers, their military and security establishments, both parties in Congress. The murder of entire countries was endorsed by the presstitute media and the heads of state of Washington’s European, Canadian, Australian, and Japanese vassals. Trump and his deplorables have a long way to go to match this record of violence.

Whether she understands it or not, Ms. Huang with her letter is shifting the violence from where it belongs to where it does not. The consequence will be to increase violence and human rights violations.

The most dangerous source of violence that we face is nuclear Armageddon resulting from the neoconservative quest for US hegemony. Since the Clinton regime every US government has broken tension-easing agreements that previous administrations had achieved with Moscow. During the Obama regime the gratuitous aggressions and false accusations against Russia became extreme.

Why doesn’t Amnesty International address the reckless and irresponsible acts of the US government that are violating the rights of people in numerous countries and pushing the world into nuclear war? Instead, there have been times when Amnesty International aligns with Washington’s propaganda against Washington’s victims.

By jumping on the military/security complex’s get Trump movement, human rights and environmental organizations have increased the likelihood that rights and environment will be lost to war.

There can be no doubt that Trump is undoing past environmental protections and opening the environment and wildlife to more destruction. However, the worst destruction comes from war, especially nuclear war.

Would things be different if the liberal/progressive/left had rallied to Trump’s support in reducing tensions with Russia, in normalizing the hostile relations that Obama had established with Moscow? Would the support of the liberal/progressive/left have helped Trump resist the pressures from the neoconservative warmongers? In exchange for support for his principal goal, would Trump have mitigated industry’s attacks on the environment and vetoed the renewal of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that violates human rights?

We will never know, because the liberal/progressive/left could not see beyond the end ot its nose to comprehend what it means for the environment and for human rights for nuclear powers to be locked into mutual suspicion.

Thanks to the failure of the liberal/progressive/left and to the presstitute media to understand the stakes, the military/security complex has been successful in pushing Trump off his agenda. The damage that a mining company and offshore drilling can do to the environment is large, but it pales in comparison to the damage from nuclear weapons.

It’s Not Really President Trump Who Needs His Mouth Washed Out With Soap



Throwing the spotlight on so-called Men of the Cloth: It’s not President Donald Trump who needs to have his mouth washed out with soap for having allegedly made use of the vulgar ‘s’ word at a White House meeting on immigration. There’s just no getting around it that some words are more painful than cuss words, particularly when they heap praise on abortion advocates. “Members of President Trump’s evangelical advisory council decided to jump ship for the day and publicly sided with Nancy Pelosi on DACA. (RedState, Jan. 18, 2018)

“You have always taken the lead. Your commitment to the immigrant community to the ‘Dreamers’ is second to none. So America is in a better place because of your prophetic leadership on this matter,” the Rev.Samuel Rodriguez, who spoke at Trump’s inauguration last year, told Pelosi at a press conference on Thursday.” Prophetic? Really?” Pelosi, of course, is one of the loudest advocates of abortion ever elected, coming second only to former President Barack Obama, champion of partial birth abortion. How sincere was Rev. Rodriguez when he raised the name of President Donald Trump in prayer at his inauguration? Discomfited by the president’s use of an expression he has denied using, Rev. Rodriguez, a member of the “unofficial” evangelical advisory board and the president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference noted that “every single person is created in the image of God” and spoke of welcoming people equally from Nigeria and Norway, albeit after “a rigorous vetting process.” “Later in the day, he said more: “In addition, and with great due deference, I believe that the comments attributed to our president can best be described as wrong, inappropriate, and hurtful. Why? Because when God looks at these nations, He sees His children.” (Yahoo, Jan. 15, 2018)

It should go without saying that our Creator sees among “His children, millions of babies killed in their mother’s wombs. Sadly, the pastor is not the only one who hypocritically regards the president’s alleged use of the ‘s’ word as more preach-worthy than the open advocation of abortion. Isn’t it more than a tad hypocritical, if not downright sanctimonious that the Vatican newspaper, L’Osservatore Romano would try a wash-his-mouth-with-soap stance on the latest alleged expletive of President Donald Trump? We all know by now that President Trump’s alleged use of the ‘s’ word was tattle-taled to the Internet world by Catholic U.S. Senator Dick Durbin, who went straight to the media to report the vulgarity had been “repeatedly” used at a White House meeting on immigration. Tattletale Dicky Durbin

Continued below... The newspaper, L’Osservatore Romano—the Vatican’s flagship—gave Trump’s comments about the immigration debate in the United States, front page attention, noting the comments had immediately sparked “controversy and indignation”. Never mind that Trump denies using the term. Mercifully, the newspaper did not print the vulgar word that automatically spiralled the Democrats into a full-on faux rage. No, none of that over here. But it’s not just vulgar expletives that rile people up. Some words indiscriminately used to honor abortion advocates are just as—if not more—offensive to the Faithful. Some some pro-life Catholics must have thought of the ‘s’ word when reading on Twitter that abortion advocate Lilianne Ploumen, former Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation in the Netherlands, was recently honored by Pope Francis with the title of ‘Commander in the Pontifical Equestrian Order of St. Gregory the Great’. This was one Tweet that turned out to be as troubling as it was true: “The Lepanto Institute was able to confirm from a December 22, 2017 Dutch radio broadcast that Ploumen indeed received the honor. In a brief video clip promoting the broadcast, Ploumen displays the medal while saying that she received it from the Pope. (Lepanto Institute, Jan.12, 2018)

“To say that Lilianne Ploumen is “pro-abortion” is an extreme understatement and doesn’t even come close to the scandalous reality of her activism. “In January of last year, after US President Donald Trump reinstated the Mexico City Policy, Ploumen launched a new NGO called She Decides to provide mass amounts of funds to organizations that would no longer receive funds from the US government. The Mexico City Policy automatically denies US funding for international organizations which perform or promote abortion. “Referring to the Mexico City Policy as a “Global Gag Rule,” Ploumen stated that the intention of She Decides was to continue support for existing programs being run by organizations such as the United Nations Population Fund (UNPFA), the International Planned Parenthood Federation and Marie Stopes International. She said, “These are successful and effective programs: direct support, distributing condoms, making sure women are accompanied at the birth, and making sure abortion is safe if they have no other choice.” The LePanto Institute continues their Ploumen profile: “But Ploumen’s anti-Catholic activity isn’t restricted to abortion. In September of 2017, Ploumen participated in the United Nations LGBTI Core Group. As the first speaker at the event, Ploumen noted that “LGBTI rights are human rights.” In her opening remarks, she said, “We cannot be complacent. [Today] in more than 70 countries homosexuality is still criminalized…stigma against LGBT people continue all over the world.” “In 2014, Ploumen ended foreign aid to the country of Uganda for passing a bill banning sodomy and same-sex “marriage.” In February of 2010, Ploumen called on LGBT activists to descend upon and disrupt Mass at St. John the Baptist Cathedral, wearing pink triangles with the words “Jesus excludes no one.” “The reason? She and other pro-LGBT activists were protesting the Church’s moral teaching regarding homosexuality.”

Continued below... We already know how Pope Francis profiles President Donald Trump: “In 2016, in response to a question about then-candidate Trump’s views on immigration and his intention to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, Francis said a man with such views was “not Christian”. (Reuters, Jan. 12, 2018) “Trump, who grew up in a Presbyterian family, shot back saying it was “disgraceful” for the pope to question his faith.” Actions speak so much louder than cuss words. Thousands will be taking part in the 2018 March for Life today. Neither Rev. Rodriguez nor Pope Francis will be there, but President Trump will be, addressing the crowd by satellite.

593,675,Donald Trump Jr. Denies Any Ties To White House,"WASHINGTON, DC — Just hours after testifying before the House Intelligence Committee that his meeting with Russian officials had “no connection” to the 2016 U.S. election, Donald Trump Jr. has strongly denied any association to the White House.

In a statement read by his lawyer, Sergei Mikhailov, the American President’s son strenuously denied “any and all ties to the current administration in America”.

“Donald Jr. has no involvement with the White House or the American government whatsoever,” Mr. Mikhailov said. “All issues relating to the American government have been placed firmly in the hands of the President’s other children—Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany and Baron.”

“My client does not really know Mr. Trump, has had no contact with him nor has he ever even held a personal conversation with him in his entire life,” Donald Jr.‘s attorney added, declaring any reports to the contrary are “fake news”.

Furthermore Mr. Mikhailov announced that his client would never cheapen his relationship with the Russian government by discussing political matters with the American government.

“My client would also like to assure any members of the Russian government present here today that my client has no divided loyalty and is firmly committed to promoting Russia’s interests both at home and internationally,” he said.

Sources inside the White House laughed off Donald Jr.’s claims, saying he “lied about everything” except for having never had a personal conversation with his father in 39 years.

Meanwhile Trump’s critics have argued that Donald Jr. doing nothing to actively help the American people, makes him the “perfect representative” of the current White House administration.

JERUSALEM, Israel — Israel’s markets regulator will propose regulation to ban companies based on bitcoin and other digital currencies from trading on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, he said on Monday.

Shmuel Hauser, the chairman of the Israel Securities Authority (ISA), told the Calcalist business conference he will bring the proposal to the ISA board next week. If approved, it would be subject to a public hearing and then the stock exchange bylaws would need to be amended.

“If we have a company whose main business is digital currencies, we would not allow it. If already listed, its trading will be suspended,” Hauser said, adding the ISA must find the appropriate regulation for such companies. …

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

Daniel Gruss didn’t sleep much the night he hacked his own computer and exposed a flaw in most of the chips made in the past two decades by hardware giant Intel, something we discussed in “Why The Implications Of The Intel “Bug” Are Staggering.” And as Reuters describes in fascinating detail, the 31-year-old information security researcher and post-doctoral fellow at Austria’s Graz Technical University had just breached the inner sanctum of his computer’s CPU and stolen secrets from it.

Until that moment, Gruss and colleagues Moritz Lipp and Michael Schwarz had thought such an attack on the processor’s ‘kernel’ memory, which is meant to be inaccessible to users, was only theoretically possible.

“When I saw my private website addresses from Firefox being dumped by the tool I wrote, I was really shocked,” Gruss told Reuters in an email interview, describing how he had unlocked personal data that should be secured.

Gruss, Lipp and Schwarz, working from their homes on a weekend in early December, messaged each other furiously to verify the result.

“We sat for hours in disbelief until we eliminated any possibility that this result was wrong,” said Gruss, whose mind kept racing even after powering down his computer, so he barely caught a wink of sleep.

Gruss and his colleagues had just confirmed the existence of what he regards as “one of the worst CPU bugs ever found”.

The flaw, now named Meltdown, was revealed on Wednesday and affects most processors manufactured by Intel since 1995.

Separately, a second defect called Spectre has been found that also exposes core memory in most computers and mobile devices running on chips made by Intel, Advanced Micro Devices and ARM Holdings, a unit of Japan’s Softbank.

Both would enable a hacker to access secret passwords or photos from desktops, laptops, cloud servers or smartphones. It’s not known whether criminals have been able to carry out such attacks as neither Meltdown nor Spectre leave any traces in log files.

Intel says it has started providing software and firmware updates to mitigate the security issues. ARM has also said it was working with AMD and Intel on security fixes.

Finding a Fix

The discovery was originally reported by online tech journal The Register. As a result of that report, research on the defect was published a week earlier than the manufacturers had planned, before some had time to work out a complete fix.

The Graz team had already been working on a tool to defend against attempts to steal secrets from kernel memory.

In a paper presented last June they called it KAISER, or Kernel Address Isolation to have Side-channels Effectively Removed.

As the name suggests, KAISER seeks to defend the kernel memory from a so-called side-channel attack that exploits a design feature of modern processors that increases their speed.

This involves processors executing tasks “out-of-order”, and not in the sequence received. If the CPU makes the right speculative call, time is saved. Get it wrong and the out-of-order task is cancelled and no time is lost.

Researcher Anders Fogh wrote in a subsequent blog that it might be possible to abuse so-called speculative execution in order to read kernel memory. He was not able to do so in practice, however.

Responsible Disclosure

Only after the December self-hacking episode did the significance of Graz team’s earlier work become clear. It turned out that the KAISER tool presented an effective defense against Meltdown. The team quickly got in touch with Intel and learned that other researchers – inspired in part by Fogh’s blog – had made similar discoveries.

They were working under so-called responsible disclosure, where researchers inform affected companies of their findings to give them time to prepare ‘patches’ to repair flaws they have exposed.

The key players were independent researcher Paul Kocher and the team at a company called Cyberus Technology, said Gruss, while Jann Horn at Google Project Zero came to similar conclusions independently.

“We merged our efforts in mid-December with the team around Paul Kocher and the people from Cyberus Technology to work on two solid publications on Meltdown and Spectre,” said Gruss.

Gruss had not even been aware of the work Horn was doing.

“Jann Horn developed all of this independently – that’s incredibly impressive,” he said. “We developed very similar attacks, but we were a team of 10 researchers.”

The wider team said patches for Meltdown, based on KAISER, had been readied for Microsoft and Apple operating systems, as well as for the Linux open-source system.

There is as yet no fix for Spectre, which tricks programmes into leaking their secrets but is viewed as a harder exploit for a hacker to carry out.

Asked which of the two flaws posed the greater challenge, Gruss said: “The immediate problem is Meltdown. After that it is going to be Spectre. Spectre is more difficult to exploit but also to mitigate. So in the long run I’d bet on Spectre.”

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

By Grant Phillips

“He will swallow up death forever. The Sovereign LORD will wipe away the tears from all faces; he will remove his people’s disgrace from all the earth.” (Isaiah 25:8)

“For the Lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd; he will lead them to springs of living water. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.” (Revelation 7:17)

“He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.” (Revelation 21:4)

In the above passages we are told that God will wipe away all tears from the eyes of His people after the Tribulation and entering the Millennium. He refers to Israel in Isaiah 25:8, then the Tribulation martyrs in Revelation 7:17 and finally all those who are His in Revelation 21:4.

We see in Revelation 21:4 that once He has done so, there will be no more death, mourning, crying or pain, for all the old things will be gone and no more.

My guess is that many of us have wondered why there would be tears in the first place, so allow me to provide my opinion.

Isaiah 25:8 – Israel

No nation of people, individually and collectively, has come anywhere near the suffering Israel has endured for so many long years. It is true that their trials and tribulations have arisen primarily because of their disobedience and rejection of their Messiah.

Revelation 7:17 – Tribulation Martyrs

The martyrs are those who were left behind at the Rapture but came to Christ and were saved during the Tribulation. Their suffering will be for a very short period, but it will be no less horrible than anyone could imagine.

Revelation 21:4 – All God’s People

From Adam and Eve to the last saint to enter into Heaven’s family at the end of the Tribulation by faith in the Son of God, we have all suffered from the effects of sin that entered the world.

Why would there be tears? I think there is more than one reason, but the first that comes to mind, obviously, is the joy that, “the old order of things have passed away.”

Many of us have lost Christian family members and friends to physical death; husbands, wives, children, parents, sisters, brothers, et al. Even though our hearts have been broken because of our loss, Heaven has been their gain. There is no doubt that not one of them would want to return to this fallen world if they could.

When we are all united with our Savior and Lord and “the old order of things have passed away,” I believe the tears will come from joy, relief, gratitude, and even regret (I’ll come back to this one).

JOY

What are two things that immediately come to mind when we have extreme joy? The first two things that come to my mind are laughter and tears. If we can experience something so thrilling on earth that it brings laughter and tears, would not the joy of being with Jesus Christ supersede anything else we could imagine? The joy of knowing that all bad things have passed away and we will live as a family with Almighty God for eternity makes me smile as I type these thoughts. Surely, one reason for our tears will be from the overwhelming joy we will have on that day.

RELIEF

Could “relief” be another reason? I know no one who enjoys going to the dentist. Isn’t it a relief to be walking out the door as opposed to walking in the door at the dentist office?

Some have been diagnosed with cancer, gone through the treatments and then received a clean bill of health. Think about the relief that is felt in hearing, “You’re cancer free.” My wife and I know this kind of relief, and I can assure you, it is tearfully overwhelming.

GRATITUDE

What does it mean to be grateful? It means we are thankful or appreciative. When we are with Jesus on that day every one of us will certainly be thankful for His love for us, even more so than we are now.

We will see the scars in His hands which are the visible trademarks of His sacrifice to redeem us from Satan’s slave market.

Maybe we will remember how close we came to not calling on Him to save us. Maybe we will think of all the sin in our lives that could have annulled our salvation, if it weren’t for the guarantee of His Holy Spirit that sealed us. Perhaps we will be reminded of our rebellion, but will then realize His firm grip upon us kept us in His hands.

I believe our gratitude will bubble over into tears of appreciation for all He has done and all He has provided; especially knowing we don’t deserve it.

REGRET

Could there be tears of regret that we didn’t serve Him on earth as we should have? Could tears of regret cloud our eyes, knowing we could have spoken out more for Him and stood a little taller? Will God wipe away tears that come from our eyes because we know many are not with us, and we never witnessed to them about Jesus?

CONCLUSION

Whatever the reason or reasons may be for our tears, can’t you feel the tenderness and love that comes from God as He wipes away those tears?

Whatever picture you have in your mind of our Father in Heaven, our Savior and Lord, and our Comforter, has it changed any in seeing His tenderness as He wipes away your tears and my tears?

The touch of someone who loves us brings such comfort to our hearts. Perhaps your mother did that for you as a child. Think of the touch of God as He wipes away each tear and comforts us with His love.

God is not a mean tyrant in Heaven, just waiting for you and me to “mess up.” He loves us beyond anything we can understand. I believe our tears will fall when we experience His love on that day, face to face.

178,207,"Food Bank Gets Donation, Realizes Can Is 35-Years-Old; Decides To Open It And Film What’s Inside","Food banks receive donations from generous people, but oftentimes they get an outdated can in the mix. In some cases, a recently expired can is still edible, but what about a product that is years beyond the expiration? Watch the video to see what a can of sweet corn, with a best used by date of August 1982, looks like when it’s opened by an employee of a food bank in Cardiff where the item was donated.

She runs a can opener along the top, which appears to be free of any dents or rust, and it makes a fresh pop as it’s cut into. Once open, you might be surprised to find that the corn looks every bit as fresh as a can that has not expired.

By all appearances, it’s fresh and bright in color, but does it pass the sniff test? While the woman smells it and doesn’t say it smells like it’s gone bad, she does note that it has a very strong metallic odor. Based on the long overdue date and the tin smell, she says it’s not okay for consumption. Needless to say, the vegetable doesn’t undergo a taste test, but if her reaction to the smell is any indication, it’s not going to taste very good.

Others noted that another item in the lineup of donated products was a Heinz kidney soup, which is a flavor that’s no longer made. The can is believed to be at least 46-years-old!

Helen Bull, the trust’s partnership and fundraising manager, explained the reason why they sometimes get older donations, noting: “Especially at harvest time people empty their cupboards of food they no longer need. It’s out of a generous heart but I just think they don’t think and don’t necessarily look at the dates.”

Of the Heinz can, she noted, “It would be great if anybody wants to give us lots of money for it. It should probably be in a museum.” The outdated can of soup even caught Heinz’s attention, as the company tweeted: “Wow! That soup was discontinued over 35 years ago. Should be in a museum rather than a food bank!”

As for what they do when they receive out-of-date food items, Helen explained: “Sometimes we do end up throwing quite a lot of food out. We get an awful lot of out-of-date food.”

These vintage cans, however, she said they will keep, saying, “It might remind people to give us in-date food.”

One commenter on The Mirror’s coverage of the story noted that they would likely have given the food a taste, saying:

“I would of tasted it. I reckon it would be fine…we in the UK eat with our eyes not our mouths/taste buds. Well not me. Stilton anyone!” Another noted: “I don’t look at dates. They said they found some corned beef from the Napoleonic wars which was still edible. That’s good enough for me. If it smells and looks OK?”

One commenter further noted that they’re “not that fussy,” explaining, “My mum gave us ketchup which was suspiciously dark (although we still ate it) – it was 15 years old. We also found a tin of condensed milk that was 20 something years old and tried it — looked dodgy, tasted fine! Mind you I love condensed milk so maybe I’m just not that fussy.”",http://awm.com/food-bank-gets-donation-realizes-can-is-35-years-old-decides-to-open-it-and-film-whats-inside-2/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
6787,7748,WILL DEMOCRATS TRY TO KILL TRUMP?,"Subscribe to Canada Free Press for FREE

Obama--in my elderly, experienced, seasoned opinion--you have no character at all. You are a soulless, evil, driven simulacrum; you are a simulation. You are a mimicry of Humanity

WILL DEMOCRATS TRY TO KILL TRUMP?

Donald J. Trump, if I were part of the assigned detail to protect you with my body, I would. Donald J., even I were just there for some other reason I would still protect you with my body, if I could. Donald: Barry Soetoro, AKA Barrack Hussein Obama, was elected President twice.

On both occasions—twice—he was also SWORN IN TWICE. And I don’t believe anything they say as to why he was sworn in twice, both times. In both 2008, and 20012. Because they are proven liars, and I don’t believe their lies about anything. I think Barry Soetoro was first sworn in privately, off camera, so he would be in full possession of all powers of protection as President—when he was publicly sworn in, for the cameras, both times he was elected. He wanted to be “ready.” I think he and the mad-dog Democrat horde expected all us white, “KKK Fascist Racist Republican Nazis,” to riot, kill, and plunder, at his inauguration—as he apparently saw things. Him bein’ all black ‘an sech‚... as he has since stated. Well, that never happened. No race riots. Not even a single non-race riot by us. We—Americans—we have always peacefully accepted Presidential election results. It’s who we are. It’s what we’re about. We are not like lying, thieving, violent Democrats. However, in apparent contrast, the loon, Democrat cabal seems almost 100% subscribed to 19th and 20th Century European, Socialist, Marxist, Communist, Fascist political dogma. That of riot, violence, bombing, burning, shooting, kidnapping, murder, lies, and general mayhem.

This alien plan was brought to America incipiently by 20th Century, foreign, “immigrants, unionists, bolsheviks” and others. It was, and is, an illicit doctrine which is alien to America and American values. It is also incompatible with human life. From En.m.Wikipedia.org: “The >Red Scare of 1919-1921 had fueled…fears of foreign radicals migrating to undermine American values and provoke an uprising like Russia’s 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. The number of immigrants entering the United States decreased for about a year from July 1919 to June 1920 but also doubled the year after that….” And it was that very same doubled “migration” which helped introduce alien socialist poison to the living bloodstream of a free America. My own ancestors began arriving here, in the late 1800s, but they were fleeing the Russian slaughter of Jews. The “pogroms.” They came here, freed and thankful—they loved America, worked very hard, learned English, and assimilated. But there were still those dark forces, European Communists and One Worlders. Just like those of today; vastly cold and unsympathetic intelligences who watched, envied, and conspired to tear America down. America the Beautiful. Today, their inheritors—the seething, psychotic, melting, Democrat Horde, foreign trillionaires, Socialists, Commies and Fascists, and every other loon splinter group—all of them.

Continued below... Donald J. Trump: do NOT count on President Barack Hussein Obama to protect you at your inauguration All of them want to raze American traditions and institutions to the ground. And eradicate you, shut you up, ship you off, or kill you, it seems to me. They want to replace you and me with themselves. Like in the insectoid capacity for “mimicry.” They may look like us, but they are not us. They only simulate being us. They are not “human,” as we think of it. They can only mimic our own, inherent humanity. And they eat our young. They want to replace our young with theirs. The young snowflakes whom they are today cultivating for harvest and consumption. The useless zombies who have already fallen to their incantations and lies. Is that what you want? To be a farm animal? —So. And this is central to our survival: why was Barry Soetoro sworn in twice, each time he was elected President of the United States? That’s my question here. —And my answer is: it was because in their diseased Democrat brains, their twisted viewpoints, they automatically project onto us, their OWN evil desires, needs, and political lusts. They accuse us of whatever sins THEY are actually committing and carrying out against us—against Truth, Justice, and our American Way. —So. You see: I conclude that, Barry Soetoro thought at his public “swearing in,” he would need and want to fully “crack down” with all Presidential power, upon a rioting, hateful, American populace. “Folks who don’t like me, because they don’t look like me,” I think is how this hateful, nauseating creep phrased it, about us. About you and me. Frankly, Barry, I have NEVER given a flying, stinking damn about your skin color. Call me stupid, but I believe the content of character trumps the amount of stupid melanin in one’s skin. And you—in my elderly, experienced, seasoned opinion—you have no character at all. You are a soulless, evil, driven simulacrum; you are a simulation. You are a mimicry of Humanity. So take your hatred and shove it, creep. It’s the twisted, corrosive hate of a narcissistic creep. —Therefore: in conclusion, to me, the difference between the Soetoro inauguration and the Trump inauguration, is that the Democrats REALLY DO INTEND FOR RIOTS, violence, and maybe even murder to attend. The Democrats and their Masters—the foreign, European trillionaires—are publicly importing busloads of provenly paid thugs and rioters. They freely admit to this. Will they be armed? Will they kill us? What is the goal here? Will they try to kill trump? True to their European, “bomb thrower,” Bolshevik model and doctrine, imported at the turn of the Century, the current Democrats seem to me, to seek violent overthrow of these current Presidential election results. Violent overthrow—of Trump—and our America. If they can’t do it by terrifying and threatening death to the Electors, as they are doing right now, then they will try it again at the inauguration. Donald J. Trump: do NOT count on President Barack Hussein Obama—with his self chosen Arabic names—to protect you at your inauguration. We made you President-Elect. Now it is up to you to be sworn in privately—first thing—and then publicly, if needed, use that Power to legally crush your enemies; all enemies domestic and foreign. And then, please proceed with the Rebirth of America. It’s what’s for breakfast. And it ain’t Kellogg’s, anymore.

% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson huddles Tuesday (16 January 2018) with nations that fought on America’s side in the Korean War, looking to tighten the economic noose around North Korea over its nuclear weapons even as hopes rise for diplomacy.

The 20-nation gathering on Canada’s western coast comes days after a mistaken missile alert caused panic on Hawaii, a stark reminder of the fears of conflict with the North after a year of escalating tension.

The meeting in Vancouver, hosted by Mr. Tillerson and his Canadian counterpart Chrystia Freeland, was called before the recent start of talks between North and South Korea, the first in two years. The North restored a military hotline and agreed to participate in the Winter Olympics being hosted in February by the South, a close US ally.

President Trump has also signaled openness to talks with North Korea under the right circumstances. Despite the insults and blood-curdling threats he’s traded with its leader Kim Jong-un, he suggested in an interview that the two leaders could have a positive relationship.

But Mr. Kim, widely viewed as seeking to drive a wedge between the United States and South Korea, shows no sign of making concessions toward Washington as his totalitarian government comes close to perfecting a nuclear-tipped missile that could strike the US.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the United States would not stop joint military exercises with South Korea in exchange for North Korea freezing its nuclear weapons program, and promised to keep squeezing Pyongyang economically and diplomatically until it abandons its quest.

9253,10452,FERC chairman takes a break from discussing coal plan to slam pipeline protesters,"Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman Neil Chatterjee took a break from discussing a high-profile plan to prop up coal and nuclear plants to criticize environmentalists' efforts to delay pipeline approvals.

""I understand the significance of that proceeding to everyone in this room, particularly our press friends in the corner, but as you know much has been written on this topic already,"" Chatterjee told a natural gas industry luncheon in Washington. ""It is a topic that has consumed much of the oxygen in the room over the past several weeks.""

The plan looks to provide coal and nuclear plants with market-based incentives that would reward their ability to keep the lights on when the grid is significantly strained. The plan faces major opposition from oil and natural gas producers to the wind industry.

Instead, Chatterjee used his remarks before the Natural Gas Roundtable to slam what he called the well-funded and legally savvy campaigns by climate change activist groups to significantly delay the natural gas pipeline approval process at FERC.

The independent federal agency is in charge of overseeing the development of interstate oil and natural gas pipelines. Activists have targeted natural gas pipelines because of the perceived link between the drilling process known as fracking and pipeline development. The activists equate stopping FERC with stopping the fracking process since pipelines are the only way to transport shale-produced natural gas to the market.

""It is not hard to see that opposition to natural gas pipeline projects has become much more ideologically driven than it used to be,"" Chatterjee said.

He said much has changed from when pipeline decisions might have been held up by local interests, such as a landowner or community, which focused on avoiding pipelines being built on their land. But anti-fossil fuel activism has turned pipelines into a much bigger issue that is slowing the agency's work.

""But what's new is this: increasing anxiety about carbon emissions has given rise to a national 'keep it in the ground' movement resisting any natural gas project as a matter of principle,"" Chatterjee said.

The FERC chairman said the movement is reminiscent of the nuclear power plant protests of the 1970s and '80s, but with “greater” financial backing and legal sophistication.

There has been a ""sea change in the identity, volume and goals of stakeholders participating in our proceedings, as well as in the nature and tone of the rhetoric of those who oppose pipeline projects.""

Adding to the national activist groups are the ""political branches"" of state and federal governments that ""these pipeline opponents"" now possess, alluding to members of Congress and state attorneys general that look to block fossil fuel development.

""Now, what we see are well-funded, sophisticated, national environmental advocacy organizations who understand how to use all of the levers of federal and state law to frustrate pipeline development,"" Chatterjee said.

He particularly noted the ""clever"" legal strategies employed by activist groups to confound the natural gas pipeline review process at FERC. Even if they do not win lawsuits, they manage to significantly slow the pipeline review while emboldening state opposition to pipeline development, he said.

The FERC chairman also said it has become increasingly ""evident that these folks are growing more confident in their chances in taking those challenges to the D.C. Circuit, in particular, and other federal appellate courts.""

Chatterjee said that affects FERC by forcing the agency to become ""even more deliberate in its review processes to ensure that they will withstand judicial review.""

He said the commission is looking for ways to help speed up the pipeline approval process even as outside forces are increasing their opposition.",http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/ferc-chairman-takes-a-break-from-discussing-coal-plan-to-slam-pipeline-protesters/article/2642206,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

The truth is that I never shook my shadow

Every day it’s trying to trick me into doing battle

Calling out ‘faker’ only get me rattled

Wanna pull me back behind the fence with the cattle

Building your lenses

Digging your trenches

Put me on the front line

Leave me with a dumb mind

With no defenses

But your defense is

If you can’t stand to feel the pain then you are senseless

Since this,

I’ve grown up some

Different kinda figther

And when the darkness come, let it inside you

Your darkness is shining

My darkness is shining

Have faith in myself

Truth.

I’ve seen a million numbered doors on the horizon

Now which is the future you choosen before you gone dying

I’ll tell you about a secret I’ve been undermining

Every little lie in this world comes from dividing

Say you’re my lover

say you’re my homie

Tilt my chin back, slit my troath

Take a bath in my blood, get to know me

All out of my secrets

All my enemies are turning into my teachers

Because

Light’s blinding

No way dividing

What’s yours or mine when everything’s shining

Your darkness is shining

My darkness is shining

Have faith in ourselves

Truth.

(Yeah)

Yes I’m only loving, only trying to only love

And yes, that’s what I’m trying to is only loving

Yes I’m only loving, trying to only love

I swear to god I’m only trying to be loving

Yes I’m only lonely loving

And yes I’m only feeling only loving, only loving

Ya say it ain’t loving, loving but my loving

I wanna only love til I’m only loving

I swear to god I’m only loving.

Trying to be loving, loving, loving, loving, loving, loving, love

Yes I’m only loving, yes I’m trying to only love

I swear to god I’m trying but I’m only loving

Ya say it ain’t loving, loving, loving, loving, love my love

But I’m only loving, loving, loving

The Truth.",http://collectivelyconscious.net/music/alexander-ebert-truth/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

I’ll Always Call the Jersey Shore Home

What good is family and friends When you are thousands of miles away? And when I return home, it’s for such a short stay?

No matter where I happen to be entertaining on a foreign tour,

There’s nothing like returning to my home on the Jersey Shore. I’ll always call the Jersey Shore home.

Money and fame is just fine, But being home with my family will always be my immediate quest,

It’s the only way I’m able to set both my mind and body at rest. For deep down in my soul,

I know that State of New Jersey is one place my heart loves best. So no matter what world stage I may appear,

Be it Toronto, Sydney, London, Paris or Rome There’s no greater feeling

Like performing before my fans at Home. For I’ll always call the Jersey Shore Home. Copyright Joseph P. Martino

According to a new reinsurance report issued by the Swiss Re Institute, total economic losses from natural and man-made disasters have soared 63 percent in 2017 to an estimated $306 billion, up from $188 billion in 2016.

Globally, insurers lost $136 billion from natural and man-made disasters in 2017, up from $65 billion in 2016, the third highest on record. This is “well above the previous 10-year annual average, and the third highest on sigma records,” Swiss Re said in its report. Natural disasters accounted for $131 billion of 2017’s insured losses, and man-made disasters for the remaining $5 billion. The human loss totaled around 11,000 deaths, similar to 2016.

Martin Bertogg, Head of Catastrophe Perils at Swiss Re said, “in recent years, annual insurance losses from disaster events have exceeded USD 100 billion a few times. The insurance industry has demonstrated that it can cope very well with such high losses.”

“However, significant protection gaps remain and if the industry is able to extend its reach, many more people and businesses can become better equipped to withstand the fallout from disaster events,” he added.

According to Swiss Re, “extreme weather in the US in the second half of 2017” has been the primary driver for high insured losses:

In August and September, three category 4+ hurricanes – Harvey, Irma, and Maria (HIM) – made landfall in the US. Destruction from the three hurricanes stretched from the Texas coast (Harvey) through West Florida to the Caribbean (Irma and Maria), together causing insured losses estimated to be almost USD 93 billion. Given the vast geographic footprint of the hurricanes, which affected multiple locations in quick succession and impacted multiple lines of business, a full assessment of the insured losses is still ongoing. Given the vast geographic footprint of the hurricanes, which affected multiple locations in quick succession and impacted multiple lines of business, a full assessment of the insured losses is still ongoing. The economic losses from the three events will be much higher given the significant flood damage – often uninsured – from hurricane Harvey in densely populated Houston, Texas, an extended power outage in Puerto Rico after hurricane Maria, and post-event loss amplification. The United States was the hardest hit according to the report, which indicated hurricanes: Harvey, Irma, and Maria made 2017 the “second costliest hurricane season on sigma records after 2005.”

Wildfires and thunderstorms in the US were also mentioned in the report:

Also in the second half of 2017, hot and dry weather in California created favourable conditions for wildfires to ignite and spread to urban areas. There were three major fire events in October in Northern California: Tubbs, Atlas and Mendocino Lake. Both residential and commercial property (including vineyards) were impacted. According to preliminary estimates from Property Claims Services, the major fire events triggered combined insured property losses of USD 7.3 billion. Fires are still raging in Southern California in December, and the as-yet undetermined full-year losses from wildfires will likely be higher. Other extreme weather in the US led to a high number of severe convective storms (thunderstorms). Five separate severe thunderstorm events from February to June caused insured losses of more than USD 1 billion each. The most intense and costly event was a four-day long storm in May with heavy damage to property inflicted by hail in Colorado and strong winds in other parts of southern and central states. The economic losses of this storm alone were USD 2.8 billion, with insured losses of USD 2.5 billion.

Elsewhere, Swiss Re discussed extreme weather events of various forms around the world:

In mid-September, two powerful earthquakes in Tehuantepec and Puebla, Mexico, led to numerous building collapses, claiming a large number of victims and resulting in insured losses of more than USD 2 billion. Earlier in the year, in late March, the category 4 tropical Cyclone Debbie hit the northeastern coast of Australia. Wind gusts of up to 263 km/h and widespread flooding in central and southeast Queensland and northeast New South Wales led to insured losses of USD 1.3 billion. And at the end of April, Europe suffered a cold snap, followed by a summer of heat waves and record temperatures in several locations, making 2017 a year of weather extremes. Further, severe floods in South East Asia caused large devastation and, sadly, a large number or victims.

Worldwide losses (USD bln) for man-made and natural catastrophes have absolutely exploded since 1990, according to a Swiss Re.

While natural and man-made disasters wreaked havoc globally and in the United States for the 2017 time period. Will the S&P Insurers index break the neckline?

English professors at Yale are reportedly working to “decolonize” the way they teach literature after a petition complained that the current curriculum, which is focused on the study of longstanding literary icons, ignores “the literary contributions of women, people of color, and queer folk” and “actively harms” students.

From a report published in Yale News:

The department’s 30 voting faculty were “overwhelmingly in favor” of reform, according to English professor Leslie Brisman. The revised curriculum, which has yet to be finalized, places equal importance on every major historical period from medieval to contemporary, expanding upon the current requirement of three pre-1800 courses and one pre-1900 course. The long-standing “Major English Poets” sequence of English 125 and 126 will remain, but students will be able to chose other paths towards completing the major. Students will be asked to complete three courses from a suite of four, including two semesters of English poetry, one of American literature and one in global Anglophone literature, to build on close reading strengths while exploring the writers and periods covered in introductory courses, said Director of Undergraduate Studies and English professor Jessica Brantley.

The decision, which the department has not formally announced, comes nearly one year after 160 students signed a petition calling for the department to “decolonize” its course offerings.",http://beforeitsnews.com/tea-party/2017/10/decolonize-is-the-hip-new-way-to-say-white-men-can-only-ruin-culture-2601657.html,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

Corne accused viewers of being “pussified non-Americans” and said they are just as bad as those illegal immigrants taking over the United States, raping citizens.

160,188,#MeToo! Our culture of sexual predation – Baptist News Global,"Social media is blowing up about a culture of sexual harassment and assault. The sordid tale of Harvey Weinstein’s pattern of predatory behavior against women has opened up a larger conversation about the almost universal experience of sexual exploitation of women. We have been ogled, called “babes,” touched without permission and raped. This does not just occur in the entertainment industry, but in every profession, including ministry.

Many clergywomen have voiced their experiences of violation, often perpetrated by friends in seminary, senior pastors and judicatory leaders — many of whom were publicly affirming of women in ministry. Baptists are not absent from this tale of abuse, and our refusal to talk about it forthrightly has only given license to predators. I am grateful that Baptist Women in Ministry is working on a major project addressing sexual abuse.

Far too many of us have a story of unwanted attention and worse, usually entailing a major power differential. Male colleagues have propositioned their female colleagues; some male pastors have taken advantage of vulnerable counselees; men have felt free to comment on women’s appearance in a sexually suggestive way; male professors have sought hugs and endearments from female graduate students or younger women colleagues; and, women have been silenced when speaking about these behaviors. Not surprising, the cycle has gone on. That is why so many Baptist women in ministry are posting “Me, too.”

There have been some serial predators in moderate Baptist circles, and only in conversation with other women in ministry have we discovered our similar stories of untoward actions by these men. They did not lose their ministerial credentials, and often they moved on to even more lucrative professional pursuits.

Experiences such as these bring shame to women, vocational redirection for some, and deepened awareness of how systems protect abusers. When a female pastor lodged a complaint about a pastoral colleague on the same staff (multiple women of the church had complained of his behavior toward them), many of the congregation took his side and departed when he left. They believed him incapable of such, and they did not trust the word of the female pastor. Why would she even need to bring it up, they wondered.

Patriarchy had certainly conditioned them to believe the male pastor instead of the female, even though she had higher rank on the pastoral staff. Congregants were more upset with her for calling for the discipline of this minister than upset with him for his violation of ministry ethics.

I have my own stories, as will many readers of this column. As a seminary student, a married doctoral student who was my Greek instructor began to stop by my study carrel in the library, inviting me to go out with him. He would say things like, “If only I had met you before I married,” and other inappropriate things. I refused his invitations, and I am not sure if my grade was lowered from an A to an A- because of that.

I was once invited for a weekend of preaching, and the pastor came to pick me up at the airport alone. I had thought his wife was coming, too. He kept asking if I wanted to go shopping or stop and get a drink. I managed to persuade him that I really needed to finish preparation for the varied events of the weekend. I kept my distance the rest of the weekend, making sure I was not alone with him. I later learned of other women who had experienced this kind of behavior — and more — from him.

As more women enter the ranks of ministry, some men have reacted to what they see as a threatening incursion with renewed diminishment of women, often through sexualizing them inappropriately. Women must call this out for what it is: predatory behavior. In a time when the president of the United States can brag about sexual assault, many men are emboldened to act on their worst impulses.

I am thankful that many are speaking clearly about a culture of sexual predation. This conversation is hardly finished, and many are finding their voices.",https://baptistnews.com/article/metoo-culture-sexual-predation/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

Pope Francis has warned of the dangers of ‘satanic’ fake news, comparing the the purveyors of such information to the snake in the Garden of Eden.

He described false news as “evil” and accused peddlers of disinformation of employing “snake-tactics” similar to Satan who, disguised as a serpent, tempted Eve to eat fruit from the forbidden tree.

He issued the unusual warning in a document issued on Wednesday ahead of the Catholic Church’s World Day of Social Communications, which takes place on May 13.

Reuters reports: The document was issued after months of debate on how much fake news may have influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign and the election of President Donald Trump.

“Spreading fake news can serve to advance specific goals, influence political decisions, and serve economic interests,” the pope wrote, condemning the “manipulative use of social networks” and other forms of communication.

Called “The truth will set you free – fake news and journalism for peace”, the document was issued in advance of the Catholic Church’s World Day of Social Communications on May 13.

“This false but believable news is ‘captious’, inasmuch as it grasps people’s attention by appealing to stereotypes and common social prejudices and exploiting instantaneous emotions like anxiety, contempt, anger and frustration,” Francis said.

“SATAN’S SERPENT”

False stories, the Pope said, spread so quickly that even authoritative denials often could not contain the damage done and many people run the risk of becoming “unwilling accomplices in spreading biased and baseless ideas”.

He called for “education for truth” that would help people discern, evaluate and understand news in order to recognize the “sly and dangerous form of seduction that worms its way into the heart with false and alluring arguments”.

Francis compared the use of fake news to the Bible story of the devil, who, disguised as a serpent, persuaded Eve to eat the fruit of the forbidden tree. He said she was fed wrong information by Satan, who told her the fruit would make her and Adam as all-knowing as God.

“We need to unmask what could be called the ‘snake-tactics’ used by those (purveyors of fake news) who disguise themselves in order to strike at any time and place.”

Vatican spokesman Greg Burke, a former reporter for U.S. outlets, told Reuters Television: “The Pope is not saying that all journalists are snakes but he is certainly acknowledging that they can be.”

The pope said the role of journalists was “not just a job, it is a mission” and they had particular responsibility to stem fake news.

2052,2353,Signs and Wonders by Warren Cole Smith,"Justice for Jack. In case you’ve been living in an underground bunker for the past few months: The case of Jack Phillips and Masterpiece Cakeshop was argued before the Supreme Court today. This case will have implications for religious liberty for decades. I first covered this case in 2014, when I interviewed Phillips in his bakery in a strip mall in a Denver suburb. This is a big day not just for Jack Phillips, but for all of us who care about religious liberty in America. The Colson Center’s own John Stonestreet spoke on the steps of the Supreme Court at a rally hosted by Alliance Defending Freedom, which is representing Phillips. Kristen Waggoner, the lawyer currently defending Phillips, participated in a Colson Center webinar a couple of months ago.

Demography is Destiny. Back in the 1970s, doomsday prophets such as Paul Ehrlich predicted a “population bomb” that would lead to an overcrowded planet, disease, and mass starvation. He and his progressive fellow-travelers recommended abortion, euthanasia, and centralized government planning. These totalitarian solutions proved to be far worse than the alleged problem, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of millions in the 20th century. The Bible, on the other hand, teaches that “children are a blessing” (Ps. 127:3) to be loved and nurtured, not a curse to be lifted. The true curse is a lack of children. A powerful story in The New York Times tells the tragic tale of Japan’s aging population, many members of whom die alone and in despair. In fact, Japan now has an expression, “lonely deaths,” to describe the phenomenon. The Times story is not for the faint of heart … or weak of stomach. It tells of “4,000 lonely deaths a week,” one of which went undiscovered until authorities “found his skeleton near the kitchen, its flesh picked clean by maggots and beetles, just a few feet away from his next-door neighbors.”

Rest in Peace. Ross A. McGinnis died on Dec. 4, 2006, 11 years ago yesterday. He was 19. McGinnis died by throwing himself on a hand grenade in Iraq, saving the lives of four of his brothers-in-arms. When asked in kindergarten what he wanted to be when he grew up, McGinnis replied, “An Army man.” His Medal of Honor citation states in part: “That afternoon his platoon was conducting combat control operations in an effort to reduce and control sectarian violence in the area. While Private McGinnis was manning the M2 .50-caliber Machine Gun, a fragmentation grenade thrown by an insurgent fell through the gunner’s hatch into the vehicle. Reacting quickly, he yelled ‘grenade,’ allowing all four members of his crew to prepare for the grenade’s blast. Then, rather than leaping from the gunner’s hatch to safety, Private McGinnis made the courageous decision to protect his crew. In a selfless act of bravery, in which he was mortally wounded, Private McGinnis covered the live grenade, pinning it between his body and the vehicle and absorbing most of the explosion. Private McGinnis’ gallant action directly saved four men from certain serious injury or death. Private First Class McGinnis’ extraordinary heroism and selflessness at the cost of his own life, above and beyond the call of duty, are in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.”

Milestones. Writer and Holocaust chronicler Hannah Arendt died this week in 1975. She coined the phrase “the banality of evil” to describe Nazi bureaucrat Adolf Eichmann’s role in the extermination of 7 million men, women, and children during the Holocaust…. Jazz great Dave Brubeck died on this date in 2012. In addition to his most famous piece, “Take Five,” he also wrote music for the church. You can read my 2012 obituary of Brubeck here.

4695,5277,An Oil for Food Expose,"Having stood trial for almost a month in a Manhattan federal courtroom, 83-year-old Texas tycoon Oscar S. Wyatt Jr. struck a deal Monday. He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the United Nations’ former Oil for Food program for Iraq.

Brushing past me on his way out of the courtroom—he’s clearly familiar with my writing on the subject—he shot a remark: “You ought to be happy.”

Actually, the pity is that the trial ended sooner than expected. Wyatt is the first major Oil for Food contractor—anywhere—to face a jury in open court. His weeks on trial brought the most vivid glimpses yet into the labyrinth of graft and greed in the U.N. program, operating from 1996-2003, that was meant to allow Saddam Hussein to sell oil solely to relieve suffering in his country.

Wyatt’s trial also underscored the vitality and ingenuity with which private players can drive, fly, haggle and connive their way past embargoes—especially those enforced by the murky, politicized and largely unaccountable bureaucracy of the U.N. (Benon Sevan, the former head of Oil for Food who was indicted in New York in January on charges of bribery and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, is a fugitive, denying wrongdoing but beyond reach of U.S. extradition on his native Cyprus).

Despite many investigations launched in the U.S. over the past few years, the inside players who witnessed Saddam’s machinations firsthand have remained offstage, their stories distilled second-hand into written reports. Not here. Star witnesses facing Wyatt from the stand included two former Iraqi officials, Mubdir Al-Khudair and Yacoub Y. Yacoub. They have never before been questioned in a public setting, and were relocated to the U.S. by federal authorities this past year to protect them against retaliation in Iraq for cooperating in this probe.

Messrs. Khudair and Yacoub described a system corrupt to the core. Their duties inside Saddam Hussein’s bureaucracy consisted largely, and officially, of handling and keeping track of kickbacks. That included who had paid and how much, and via which front companies. When Saddam’s regime systematized its Oil for Food kickback demands across the board in 2000, keeping track of the graft flowing into Saddam’s secret coffers became a job so extensive that the marketing arm of Iraq’s Ministry of Oil, known as SOMO (State Oil Marketing Organization) developed an electronic database to track the flow of the “surcharges,” as they were called.

To show how this worked, prosecutors last week produced a silver laptop onto which Saddam’s entire oil kickback database had been downloaded by Mr. Yacoub, from backup copies he made just before the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. With the laptop display projected onto a big screen before the jury, Mr. Yacoub booted up the system and into a query box typed “Coastal,” the name of Wyatt’s former oil company. Up came itemized lists of millions of dollars worth of surcharges he testified that Wyatt’s company, or affiliated fronts, had paid to the Iraqi regime. These were broken down not only chronologically, but according to which front companies Mr. Yacoub said had channeled the money.

The other Iraqi witness, Mr. Khudair, corroborated parts of this scene. He explained to the jury a series of detailed notes taken at secret Baghdad meetings, which he had recorded by hand in desk calendars provided as gifts by oil contractors in Iraq.

In the end, Wyatt’s guilty plea of conspiracy rested on a payment of about $200,000, made in 2001 through front companies into an Iraqi-controlled secret bank account in Jordan. But as witnesses during the trial sketched out the context, what came into view was a gigantic hidden world of dealings with Saddam’s Iraq. From a cooperating government witness, Samir Vincent (who in 2005 pleaded guilty to a number of federal charges related to Oil for Food), the jury heard that Wyatt had paid Vincent’s fees and expenses to make more than half a dozen trips per year during the early 1990s between the U.S. and Iraq to try to help Saddam out from under U.N. sanctions.

Also from Vincent, the jury heard that Wyatt’s ambition was to become the sole buyer of Iraqi oil, or at least one of the biggest. Vincent would bring such gifts to the Iraqi regime as global positioning systems, and a satellite phone which Iraq’s oil functionaries then used to call the U.N. in New York on a crystal-clear line, to try to haggle down the asking price set by the U.N. for Iraqi oil—thus creating more room for payoffs and kickbacks.

When Oil for Food began in 1996, Wyatt was determined to clinch the first oil contract, which he did. But there were many other players, and it seems Wyatt had to struggle to hang on to market share in the face of competition, trying to bargain down the kickback demands but finally agreeing to pay in order to continue getting lucrative oil contracts.

Should we expect to see that silver laptop in heavy demand by scores of other U.N. member states trying to bring Oil for Food fraudsters to justice?

Nope. As it is, the U.S. stands almost alone in prosecuting the culprits and sending the guilty to prison. In Russia, China, Syria, Cyprus, Yemen, Egypt, Malaysia, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and Jordan—to name a few significant players—there has been no such summons to justice. In Switzerland, home to a cosmopolitan nest of Oil for Food fronts, a number of companies have paid fines to federal and local authorities, but their names and the details have been kept confidential.

Here in America, under terms of his plea deal, Wyatt faces sentencing on Nov. 27—likely 18-24 months in prison and forfeiture of $11 million, which federal authorities say they will seek to transfer to the people of Iraq, who are the real victims of Oil for Food fraud.

In Switzerland, however, two of Wyatt’s former business associates and alleged co-conspirators indicted in New York, Catalina Miguel and Mohammed Saidji, appear to be going freely about their business. One of the firms with which they have both been associated, Sarenco, is an active enterprise in Geneva, with Mr. Saidji’s name on the registry documents.

I had no problem reaching Mr. Saidji there this week by phone. Before hanging up he told me, “I cannot answer any questions. I cannot make any comments.” That is the kind of response worth keeping in mind as we now entrust our national security to U.N. sanctions on Iran.",http://canadafreepress.com/article/an-oil-for-food-expose,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

I urge you to watch the video below in its entirety. Especially considering the amount of “unexplained events” that are happening all across the globe and at the same time. Everything from mysterious noises in the skies, to the deaths of massive amounts of animals, to seas and moons turning blood red, to increased earthquake and volcanic activity. Is there a link between it all? Does the Bible truly predict the future as some have claimed? And is there a day coming when the “Big Event” will arrive ushering in all Hell, literally? Or is it just a bunch of nonsense?

The videos below, by Angel of The Apocalypse, answers all that and more…

As God looks upon the Earth He sees violence, brutality, rampant immorality, chaos, and perversion of His Word. He feels the rebellion. He hears each lie. He notices the blasphemies spoken in earnest and in jest against His name and the name of His Son, who stepped forth from Eternity … “from of old, from everlasting”.

He knows what is about to take place and yet, He looks upon us with a heart of love and compassion. A heart willing to forgive and forget. A heart that yearns for His children to come to turn from their sin and return to Him. If only they would accept His offer.

There is a day coming when God’s patience with a world filled with sin, violence, and unbelief will end, and the door of escape will be closed.

These events which are about to be unleashed upon the world, are sooner then we think. The Apocalypse is coming…

“When I heard, my belly trembled, my lips quivered at the voice … rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the “Day of Trouble”… [the coming ""Apocalypse]“ Habakkuk 3:16

Jesus himself warns never in the history of Mankind has there ever been anything as terrible and deadly as the coming “Apocalypse”…

“For there will be Great Tribulation such has not been since the beginning of the world until this time no, nor ever shall be. And UNLESS those days were shortened no flesh would be saved.” Matthew 24:21-22

During this Apocalypse God will pour out His wrath on a violent, morally damage, and unbelieving generation that has turned against Jesus. . .

“I (the Lord) have held my peace a long time, I have been still and restrained myself. Now I will cry like a woman in labor… I will lay waste to the mountains and hills.” Isaiah 42:14-15

“I will punish the world for its evil, and the wicked for their iniquity… I will halt the arrogance of the proud.” Isaiah 13:11

North Korea is on a roll: just hours after it emerged that in a diplomatic victory for the Kim regime the US and South Korea agreed not to hold military drills during the Olympics, moments ago Yonhap reported that in the latest sign of de-escalation between the neighboring rivals, South and North Korea agreed on Friday to hold high-level talks next week to discuss Pyongyang’s potential participation in the PyeongChang Winter Olympics as well as ways to improve ties.

North Korea notified Seoul that it has accepted South Korea’s latest offer for talks next Tuesday, according to Seoul’s unification ministry.

“The two sides decided to discuss working-level issues for the talks by exchanging documents,” Baik Tae-hyun, ministry spokesman at the ministry, told a press briefing.

The meeting, on 9 January, will focus on finding a way for North Korean athletes to attend the Winter Olympic Games in South Korea in February, the BBC adds. As we reported previously, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said this week that sending a delegation to the games would be “a good opportunity to show unity of the people”.

The meeting is expected to be held at Panmunjom, on the border. The so-called peace village, in the heavily guarded demilitarised zone (DMZ), is where the two sides have historically held talks.

The move came after North Korean leader Kim Jong-un expressed willingness to send a delegation to the Olympics to be held in the South next month and said the country is open to inter-Korean talks over the matter during his New Year address. The South proposed Tuesday for a high-level meeting in response.

And, as discussed earlier today, the agreement came as the South and the United States agreed late Thursday to delay their joint military drills during the Winter Olympics.

North Korea has long denounced the military drills as a war rehearsal and used them as an excuse for its provocations. But the South and the U.S. said that the exercises are defensive in nature.

Next week’s talks will be the first inter-Korean dialogue since December 2015.

North Korea sent a document to the South under the name of Ri Son-gwon, the head of the North’s state agency in charge of inter-Korean affairs. The receiver is South Korean Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon, the ministry said.

After a nine-year rule of two conservative governments, liberal President Moon, who favors engagement with Pyongyang, took office in May last year. But the North’s nuclear and missile threats have prompted him to maintain the dual track of seeking sanctions and dialogue. Seoul hopes that better inter-Korean relations can help pave the way for the resolution of North Korea’s nuclear issue and broader talks between the U.S. and North Korea.

Still, some more cynical and skeptical experts said that the North’s overture to South Korea may be aimed at weakening the united front in enforcing sanctions on Pyongyang and driving a wedge in the decades-long alliance between Seoul and Washington. Of course, if contrary to all the recent peace talk North Korea surprises everyone and launches an ICBM during the olympics, it would be a strong tell that recent events were only meant to make Trump look bad, well, worse.

The Weekend Edition is pulled from the daily Stansberry Digest. The Digest comes free with a subscription to any of our premium products.

The market is getting “stretched”… The market is getting “stretched”…

The large-cap S&P 500 Index and small-cap Russell 2000 Index burst out of the gates to new highs to start 2018. In the first week of the new year, the Dow Jones Industrial Average broke 25,000 for the first time ever, less than a month after hitting 24,000.

That was the fastest 1,000-point move for the Dow in history. But it didn’t last long… The index surged to more than 26,000 this week – seven trading days after it hit 25,000.

And it’s not just in the U.S… Stocks around the world are soaring, too.

Germany’s DAX Index is trading close to record levels, while Japan’s Nikkei 225 Index recently hit its highest level since 1991. Even Russia and emerging markets like China, South Korea, and Taiwan are seeing massive breakouts in their stock markets.

Of course, as we like to say, markets are like runners… Of course, as we like to say, markets are like runners…

They can’t sprint all-out for miles on end. They need to take a “breather” occasionally. And right now, we’re seeing signs that the market needs to catch its breath…

First, we look at the relative strength index (or “RSI”) of the S&P 500. The RSI is a trusted momentum indicator, with values ranging from zero to 100.

When an asset quickly falls, it can enter “oversold” territory with an RSI below 30. This signals that the asset may be due for a rally. But the opposite is true, too. When an asset rises faster than normal, it can become “overbought,” with an RSI above 70. This is usually a time for caution… and a signal that a correction may be around the corner.

Today, the S&P 500′s monthly RSI is sitting above 80. As you can see in the following chart, it hasn’t been this high since the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s…

A second warning sign comes from the S&P 500′s 200-day moving average (“DMA”)… A second warning sign comes from the S&P 500′s 200-day moving average (“DMA”)…

This metric is considered a rough gauge of the market’s long-term trend.

During bull markets, stocks tend to spend most of their time above the 200-DMA. During bear markets, they spend most of their time below it. And perhaps most important, stocks rarely stray too far from this line in either direction before returning to it.

The following chart of the S&P 500 shows how it works.

As you can see, since stocks moved back above this trendline following the financial crisis in 2009, they have rarely traded below it.

You’ll also notice that whenever stocks have rallied significantly above this line, they have eventually come back to “test” it – touching it, or even moving below it briefly – before continuing higher…

Right now, the S&P 500 is more than 10% above the 200-DMA. And it hasn’t tested it in more than a year.

This is unusual… In fact, the market has only been this stretched above the 200-DMA three other times since the bull market began. And each of those cases preceded a sharp correction over the next several months.

A final reason for caution comes from the American Association of Individual Investors (“AAII”). A final reason for caution comes from the American Association of Individual Investors (“AAII”).

Its monthly Asset Allocation Survey shows how individual investors are currently positioned across stocks, bonds, and cash.

December’s reading showed that investors are now holding 72% of their portfolios in stocks. This is the highest allocation since the dot-com bubble. And it’s three percentage points higher than November’s reading – the biggest one-month jump in four years.

In short, investors are suddenly pouring more money into stocks than they have in nearly two decades.

To be clear, these warning signs are NOT a reason to panic… To be clear, these warning signs are NOT a reason to panic…

several other indicators continue to give the “green light” today . This suggests the next market decline is likely to be a buying opportunity in the ongoing “Melt Up,” rather than the start of a true bear market. As Steve Sjuggerud has explained,. This suggests the next market decline is likely to be ain the ongoing “Melt Up,” rather than the start of a true bear market.

More important, as Stansberry Research founder Porter Stansberry noted in the January 12 Digest, even if he’s correct and a bear market is approaching, selling your stocks now could be a terrible mistake…

Now… I’ve done my best to show you the macro framework as I see it… I hope you understand why it’s particularly important this year. But honestly, it really shouldn’t matter all that much to your investment strategy. Why not? Because you can’t know if I will be right and a bear market will develop soon. And even if I’m 100% right, you could still easily make your biggest gains of this cycle in the final few months of the bull market. In other words, even if there is a bear market and even if the markets as a whole end up down for the year, you could still make a lot of money by simply following your trailing stop losses and hanging on as long as you can. So while I think you should be aware of these macro risks… and while I believe they’re even more important this year than they have been in more than a decade… I think it’s far more important that you simply follow sound investing principles, rather than try to time the market.

No matter what happens next, we’re here for you… No matter what happens next, we’re here for you…

Super PACs, indeed, polluted the Republican primary elections, and it will get worse during the general election campaign. The short-term cure for this situation is to require that any public announcement in support or opposition to a candidate be approved publicly by the candidate named, and the cost of the announcement be disclosed by the named candidate.

For more than 20 years, now, the most powerful word in advertising has been “sustainable.” This term sells everything from toilet paper to spark plugs. This same term is even more powerful when applied to public policies such as: “sustainable” energy; transportation; agriculture; development; housing, and almost every other policy considered by government. When the term “sustainable” is used to sell a product, the product will be more expensive and less efficient than it has to be. When the term “sustainable” is used to sell a public policy, the policy will not only be more expensive and less efficient, it will be controlled by the government, and it will ultimately fail.

While liberal journalists continue to claim that Agenda 21 is just a “conspiracy theory” being advanced by right-wing crackpots, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the International Council for Environmental Law (ICEL) have released their fourth Draft of the International Covenant on Environment and Development. This document was designed from the beginning to convert the “soft-law” non-binding Agenda 21 into firmly binding global law - enforceable through the International Criminal Court and/or the dispute resolution features of the Convention on the Law of the Sea.

Many people are convinced that this President has done more to destroy the United States in three years than all the other presidents combined. The only hope of preventing another four years of even more drastic destructive policies is the election of one of the four remaining Republican candidates. The two frontrunners are using their time and resources, even on national television where they can be seen by the public, arguing over whether Newt’s consulting contract with Freddie Mac is “lobbying,” or whether Mitt is a moderate. Wake up gentlemen; the target is Obama!

Democrats like to say: “The worst thing we could do is to go back to the very same policies that created this mess in the first place.” They are absolutely correct; we do not ever want to see again the policies that created the current economic mess. But we will, if Obama is re-elected.

Democrats want their audiences to believe that “…the very same policies,” are those practiced by the Bush administration. Their hindsight stops with the 2000 election.

January 1, 2012 is the first day of the last year of the first term of the most “transformative” President in the history of the United States. Before he became president, Barack Hussein Obama told America that “…we are five days away from fundamentally transforming America.” During the first three years of his presidency, he has pushed his philosophy of governance further and further away from the philosophy of governance developed by the Framers and enshrined in the U.S. Constitution. The defining moment in the future of the United States will come on November 6, 2012, when each citizen casts – or fails to cast – a vote for the next president, and for the legislators who will guide the nation.

Where did governments – at every level – get the idea that they are supposed to manage the affairs of their citizens? Governments were first created in America to serve their citizens. Now, citizens must ask their government for permission to build a house, to drive a car, to open a business, or to buy a gun. The role and authority of government has changed over the years from an entity that serves the needs of its citizens to an entity that manages the affairs of its citizens.

Local governments have two fundamental responsibilities: (1) protect the rights of the citizens; and (2) provide the services the citizens authorize. To meet these responsibilities, local elected officials must look to the future and anticipate what services their citizens may want, and construct plans to meet those needs.

8186,9279,‘Clock Boy’ Ahmed’s Dad: Incident will ‘Spread Islam’ in America,"Mohamed Elhassan Mohamed, father of ‘Clock Boy’ Ahmed, shared another 9/11 ‘Truther’ Facebook post, only this time in Arabic, claiming that the clock incident will lead to spreading Islam in America.

Breitbart Texas reported that the family patriarch, a former Sudanese National Reform party candidate for president of that country, managed a Sudanese reform party Facebook group and posted 9/11 ‘truther’ conspiracy theories on its wall. Last week, Mohamed removed the National Reform page, perhaps in response to Western media sifting through the content. Prior to it shutting down, Breitbart Texas captured an Arabic language National Reform post that Mohamed shared on Sept. 28 and it appears he wrote it.

The Arabic post was translated for Breitbart Texas by Raymond Stock, Middle Eastern political and cultural affairs expert, a former Guggenheim Fellow with a Ph.D. in Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations from the University of Pennsylvania. He also taught Arabic and Middle East Studies and spent twenty years in Egypt.

Troubling statements in this Facebook post further the ideology of 9/11 conspiracy theories. The translation suggests that the 9/11 terror attacks were bogus, an inside-job, reading: “That the war against terror is nothing more than an illusion made in America—as al-Qa`ida was made in America, as well as what is happening now in the Arab East at the hands of the West.”

The post also alleges that the United States created 9/11 to manufacture the “war on terror.” Translated, the words read: “The events of September 11th were planned precisely to launch the war on Iraq, and 50% of the American people are becoming aware of that.”

Musing, Mohamed draws a parallel to his “clockmaker” son, asserting Islamophobia at the core of the clock incident, ignoring federal and state zero tolerance and/or safe school act policies behind his son’s arrest for bringing into an Irving, Texas, high school a perceived “hoax bomb.” According to the English translation, he instead writes: “Moreover, what happened to Ahmed Mohammed would not have occurred were he not Muslim and Sudanese.” He insists that it “shocked the West, and made Obama seek to honor him, rather than his terrorizing his fellow students.”

Then, the translated post calls Islamophobia the result of American state-controlled and delusional new media news, even claiming that Islamophobia will lead to the spread of Islam. The translation in English reads:

American society has come to live in fear of all that is Muslim or black due to the state-controlled media. And I would add: It is a fear that will turn into confidence in all that is Muslim, because what the American media present is nothing more than a lie that has no relation to reality. This will lead to the spread of Islam. The Muslims are endowed with the noble qualities of their morals—they must exploit every opportunity to reveal the truth of Islam: “Call the way to your Lord with wisdom and goodly exhortation, and have disputations with them in the best manner; surely your Lord best knows those who go astray from His path, and He knows best those who follow the right way.”—scripture from the Qur’an; Surat al-Nahl (The Bee), 16: 125.

The post links to a Collective Evolution article by Arjun Walia, who claims to provide evidence that Al Qaeda was a creation of the CIA, that the World Trade Center was brought down by “controlled demolition,” and that most terror attacks are “false flag operations.”

Mohamed joined his son this week for a Saudi government sponsored pilgrimage to Mecca where the family continued to push the U.S. Islamophobia narrative. Earlier in October, they toured Qatar’s Education, Science and Community Development, founded by Al Jazeera creator Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, who is closely associated with the Muslim Brotherhood. Ahmed Mohamed’s updated itinerary for this week includes a meeting with President Obama, a weekend White House astronomy night, and a Council for American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) gala this week.

1801,2046,Judge Sentences USA Gymnast Doctor Larry Nassar to 40-175 Years,"Victims and others look on as Rachael Denhollander speaks at the sentencing hearing for Larry Nassar, a former team USA Gymnastics doctor who pleaded guilty in November 2017 to sexual assault charges, in Lansing, Michigan. ( REUTERS/Brendan McDermid )

Join us on our podcast each weekday for an interesting story, well told, from Charisma News. Listen at charismapodcastnetwork.com.

As his victims wept in a Michigan courtroom on Wednesday, disgraced long-time USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar was sentenced to up to 175 years in prison for abusing young female gymnasts who were entrusted to his care.

""I've signed your death warrant,"" Ingham County Circuit Court Judge Rosemarie Aquilina told Nassar, following days of harrowing accounts from about 160 of his victims.

""It is my privilege—on counts 1, 2, 5, 8, 10 and 18 and 24—to sentence you to 40 years,"" Aquilina said. ""I'm going to look at my cheat sheet: 40 years, just so you know and you can count it off your calendar, is 480 months. The tail end—because I need to send a message to the parole board in the event somehow God is gracious and I know He is—and you survive the 60 years in federal court first and then you start on my 40 years. You've gone off the page here as to what I'm doing. My page only goes to 100 years. Sir, I'm giving you 175 years, which is 2100 months.""

Spectators and victims cried, applauded and embraced as Nassar, 54, wearing a dark blue jailhouse jumpsuit, was led out of the courtroom. Rachael Denhollander, the first woman to publicly accuse him in 2016, shared a hug with Angela Povilaitis, the lead prosecutor.

Nassar, who served as the program's physician through four Olympic Games, had apologized to his victims during the hearing, telling them, ""I will carry your words with me for the rest of my days.""

But Aquilina dismissed his statement as insincere and courtroom spectators gasped as the judge read aloud from a letter he wrote to her claiming he was a good doctor who was manipulated into pleading guilty.

Nassar, who already is serving a 60-year sentence in federal prison for child pornography convictions, also said his accusers fabricated claims to gain money and fame and wrote, ""Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.""

""Would you like to withdraw your plea?"" Aquilina asked Nassar after tossing aside his letter with evident disgust.

""No, your honor,"" Nassar said.

""Because you are guilty, aren't you? Are you guilty, sir?"" the judge demanded.

After a long pause, Nassar said quietly, ""I have said my plea, exactly.""

Changing View

Both the prosecution and Aquilina emphasized the broader significance of the sentencing, coming amid a national debate over sexual misconduct and abuse prompted by scandals involving powerful men from Hollywood to Washington.

Povilaitis said the conclusion of Nassar's case takes the victims' shame and puts it ""where it belongs, right on him.""

""At this particular moment in history, this sentence and hearing will be viewed as a turning point in how our community, our state, our nation, our culture looks at sexual abuse,"" she said.

Aquilina rattled off a series of disturbing statistics about the prevalence of sexual abuse before saying, ""It stops now.""

advertisement

The sentencing followed an extraordinary weeklong hearing that saw a parade of Nassar victims tell their stories in raw and unflinching terms, describing how he used medical treatments as a cover to justify penetrating their bodies with his fingers.

Although Nassar only admitted to seven instances of abuse in the case, Aquilina allowed other victims to speak at his sentencing. Throughout much of the proceedings, the bespectacled Nassar sat with his head bowed, rarely making eye contact with his victims.

His accusers ranged from famous Olympic gold medalists like Aly Raisman to women like Denhollander, who was the last of the victims to speak on Wednesday and whom Aquilina described as ""the bravest person I have ever had in my courtroom."" The accusers had testified Nassar won their trust with kind words and by giving them snacks forbidden by their coaches. Testimony came McKayla Maroney, a gold medalist at the 2012 London Olympics, who called Nassar a ""monster human being"" and a former member of the U.S. national team who said his abuse led to depression and an eating disorder.

Another gymnast said she was only 6 years old when Nassar began molesting. She blamed Nassar for her father's suicide once the man realized his daughter had not been lying about the abuse she endured.

""I've been forever changed by all of this and I will never feel small again,"" said Bailey Lorencen, who was an anonymous accuser until she spoke in court this week. ""I have a different confidence in myself as a woman.""

Institutions Questioned

In addition to his work with Olympic teams, Nassar also was the team physician for the Michigan State University gymnastics and women's crew teams, as well as an associate professor at MSU's College of Osteopathic Medicine.

The National Collegiate Athletic Association said on Tuesday it had opened an investigation into Michigan State's handling of the case. In her statement on Wednesday, Denhollander, criticized the school for failing to adequately investigate complaints against Nassar dating back years.

In addition to Raisman, Olympic gold medalists Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and McKayla Maroney have gone public in recent months, saying they were assaulted by Nassar while undergoing treatment.

Victims and others have criticized USA Gymnastics, the sport's governing body in the United States, for ignoring their complaints and have accused the federation of suppressing their accounts in a bid to avoid bad publicity.

On Monday, three top board members resigned in the wake of the scandal, following the exit last March of the federation's president and chief executive.

In a statement on Wednesday, Kerry Perry, who became USA Gymnastics president in December, applauded the sentence and vowed to ""create a culture that empowers and supports"" the program's athletes.

Several companies have announced they would not continue to sponsor the federation, including AT&T Inc on Tuesday.

Nassar pleaded guilty in November to seven counts of first-degree sex assault in Ingham County, as well as three additional charges in Eaton County, where he will be sentenced next week.

6460,7398,Occupy Wall Street and First Amendment Rights,"A United States citizen’s exclusive rights guaranteed by the Constitution end at the U.S. border. Each state within the United States has a state line, and rights exclusive to a state end at the state line; each state consists of counties, and rights exclusive to a county end at a county line; each county has cities or towns, and rights exclusive to a city or town end at the city or town limits; and within each city or town exists private property, and the owner’s rights exclusive to that property end at the property line. The United States Constitution guarantees and protects individual and collective rights, but each right ends where another right begins.

The very name Occupy Wall Street, and this arbitrary and pedestrious league of misfits’ very purpose for existence, belies constitutional protection. The very action of occupying and setting up permanent encampments on public and private property, violating local ordinances and regulations, replete with myriad felonies, wholesale disregard for public safety, the blatant violation of the rights of others, is simply not reconcilable with the 1st Amendment’s…Congress shall make no law respecting…or abridging the freedom of speech…the right of the people peaceably to assemble….

One of the intents of the Constitution was the protection of certain rights, but without the supplement of the Bill of Rights as a more specific enumeration protecting certain rights, the Constitution would not have been ratified. What is not included in the Constitution or the Bill of Rights is the right to occupy public or private property, the disregard of local laws and ordinances, and most certainly the right to infringe upon the rights of others.

The right to freedom of speech and the right to peaceably assemble were never intended to be absolute, and the Supreme Court has likewise never ruled either as an absolute right. In Hague v. C.I.O. (1939), the Supreme Court made clear that streets and sidewalks were in fact public forums, and thus protected. In 1937, the Jersey City Mayor, Frank Hague, under the guise of a 1930 city ordinance forbidding the gatherings of groups that advocated obstruction of the government by unlawful means, ordered the police department to shut down a meeting at the Committee for Industrial Organization, and to seize all materials. C.I.O. sued, arguing that the ordinance violated the 1st Amendment’s freedom of assembly.

The Supreme Court, by virtue of the 1st and 14th Amendments, struck down laws and ordinances requiring permits for speech and assemblies on streets, parks, and other public forums as discriminatory, as it was up to the discretion of the government who would or would not be granted a permit.

On July 8, 1939, in a much more subdued and benign exercise of the their 1st Amendment rights than the Occupy Wall Street’s boisterous assault upon cities across the U.S., 68 Jehovah’s Witnesses marched through the town of Manchester, New Hampshire carrying signs and blocking foot traffic on public sidewalks. This was in violation of a New Hampshire statute requiring a license for parades and processions. All 68 were convicted in municipal court for violating the state statute. The Jehovah’s Witnesses sued the state of New Hampshire for violating their freedom of worship, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of assembly. In the resulting Supreme Court case, Cox v. New Hampshire (1941), the court ruled that even though the government cannot regulate the content of speech or the right to peaceably assemble, the government can place reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions on these 1st Amendment rights for public safety concerns. After Cox v. New Hampshire, governments were allowed, by requiring the acquisition of permits, to impose reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions on the use of public property.

Forty-five years later, the right of the government to impose reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions on public property was reaffirmed with Clark v. Community for Creative Non-violence (1984). As with the Occupy Wall Street philistines, to bring attention to the homeless, the C.C.N.V. wanted to “occupy” Lafayette Park and the Washington, D.C. Mall by setting up tent encampments. The Park Service granted the C.C.N.V. a permit to demonstrate and to setup a few symbolic tents, but denied their request to make an all-encompassing encampment. The Supreme Court ruled that the Park Service regulation did not violate the 1st Amendment rights of C.C.N.V. The court also made clear that even expression is subject to reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions, and reaffirmed that the government can regulate speech and assembly with permits, fees, and imposing restrictions on time, place, and manner to ensure public safety and to protect the rights of others.

The Occupy Wall Street and its incarnation’s fundamental animus—when one can be discerned—are contrary to 70+ years of Supreme Court precedent regarding 1st Amendment rights

The Occupy Wall Street and its incarnation’s fundamental animus—when one can be discerned—are contrary to 70+ years of Supreme Court precedent regarding 1st Amendment rights. The movement has purposely blocked sidewalk traffic, street traffic, damaged local businesses and other forms of commerce, blocked access to commercial and residential buildings, and nurtured disease, crime, and the systematic violation of the rights of businesses and residences in their immediate area. It would take an implausible stretch of the imagination to believe that these acts would be protected forms of speech, expression, or peaceable assembly by established 1st Amendment standards. This group of intellectual, moral, and wayward vagabonds setting up permanent encampments on public property, straining the limits of their immediate ecological, societal, and economical environments, is exactly what it appears to be: a group of intellectual, moral, and wayward vagabonds living on public property, and through unadulterated ignorance, they actually believe that their 1st Amendment rights protect the infringement upon the rights of others, destruction of their immediate environment, commission of economic terrorism, rape, sexual assault, theft, drug dealing, drug use, prostitution, pimping underage girls, urinating and defecating on public and private property, and public fornication.

What is astonishing on multi-levels regarding the cities being occupied is the deliberate and voluntary lack of mandated action by the representative leaders to enforce each city’s laws and ordinances without prejudice. Each city has its own group of legislators, be it commissioners, councilmen, or mayors who are elected to create legislation but also to enforce the laws and ordinances of their city uniformly.

What is not astonishing is the paradox of Occupy Wall Street’s perambulatory anarchy and chaos—-which by its very definition, seeks the elimination of laws, rights, and governmental and court enforcement—-and their instantaneous wailing and writhing about in their excrement and urine saturated, apocryphal sanctuaries regarding the violation of their 1st Amendment rights. But as with all fraudulent movements coveting desultory demands, unsystematic protests devoid of substance, constructive ideas, or a plausible reason to exist, Occupy Wall Street is rapidly etiolating under the most unceremonious of conditions: a dramatic drop in a relevancy that never existed, the exodus of the liberal media and its ephemeral infatuation, and like vultures over dried bones, the calculated disassociation by liberal politicians once political expediency ceased to exist.

It is entirely plausible that with its micro-existence, its inanimate legitimacy, and its annulling impact, in one year’s time, Occupy Wall Street’s impact never breached the azoic phase, and thus the question could be asked: did the movement ever really exist, or was it just a spontaneous and promiscuous occurrence of rapes, murders, arrests, prostitution, and drugs, mired in feces and urine?",http://canadafreepress.com/article/occupy-wall-street-and-first-amendment-rights,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
5776,6612,The Lyceum Scholars Program Is Changing Higher Education at Clemson,"The Lyceum Scholars Program Is Changing Higher Education at Clemson

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

American higher education is increasingly defined by an aimless mishmash of courses on trivial topics that present no clear view of what a human being must know in order to be considered liberally educated. The result: the liberal arts have been gutted and repackaged to serve various ideological and political interests. With the exception of a few “Great Books” colleges, the overarching vision of higher education that once sustained the West for centuries seems all but dead.

This situation is why the Clemson Institute for the Study of Capitalism (CISC) has created the Lyceum Scholars Program, which is America’s first (and only) academic program dedicated to studying the moral, political, and economic foundations of a free society. Drawing inspiration from the Lyceum school founded by Aristotle, the Lyceum Scholars Program takes a Great Books approach to studying liberty, the American Founding, capitalism, and moral character.

The Program

The Lyceum Scholars Program, which is open to any major, begins with 10-15 incoming freshman, each of whom will receive a $10,000 scholarship over their four years to attend Clemson University in South Carolina. In exchange for their scholarship, Lyceum Scholars are required to take an integrated and hierarchically structured curriculum that includes the following eight courses:

Freshman Year

Introduction to Political Theory

Wisdom of the Ancients

Sophomore Year

Political Thought of the American Founding

American Political Thought

Junior Year

Constitutional Law: Rights and Liberties

Constitutional Law: Powers and Structures

Senior Year

Political Theory of Capitalism

Wisdom of the Moderns

Lyceum Scholars read classic texts in political thought from Plato and Aristotle to Locke, Montesquieu, Burke, Jefferson, Madison, and Tocqueville. They are also exposed to the classics in the history of economic thought, including Adam Smith, Frédéric Bastiat, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek, and Milton Friedman. They finish the program with a minor in Political Science and the intellectual skills of being serious and honest thinkers, articulate speakers, and eloquent writers.

By next year, we expect to have 40 Lyceum Scholars on campus, all of whom have been or will be taking the same classes and reading the same books. Our goal is to create a new kind of intellectual community where students will motivate one another to explore the history of freedom and the ideas and institutions that made Western civilization so irreplaceably unique. We hope they will push each other to engage in high-level conversations and debates and to build life-long intellectual friendships.

Emphasis on Moral Character

What makes the Lyceum Scholars Program most unique is its focus on building moral character. In response to the nihilism and moral relativism that permeates modern American culture, our goal is to recapture the long-lost tradition in American higher education that once took the idea of moral character seriously. Prior to the Civil War, for instance, every Ivy League college president taught what we today call a senior capstone course on moral theory and practice in order to educate young men for living in a free and virtuous society. Given the culture in which we live, our hope is to challenge our young men and women to take the development of their own moral character as seriously as they do their physical health.

We believe that a free society can only be sustained if its citizenry understands and act upon certain moral virtues. The Lyceum Scholars Program plans to combat this trend towards moral apathy in two ways: through classroom instruction and one-on-one mentorship. First, the Lyceum curriculum includes two courses dedicated solely to moral thought and practice—one on ancient Greek and Roman moral thought where students will read Sophocles, Xenophon, Aristotle, Cicero, Plutarch and Tacitus; and one on modern moral thought where they will read Shakespeare, Montaigne, Franklin, Smith, Austen, Dostoyevsky, and Rand. Second, and most interestingly, each Scholar will be assigned what we call a Socratic Tutor, i.e., a faculty member who will closely monitor and guide their intellectual and moral development during their undergraduate career.

The primary role of the Socratic Tutor is to help our students translate moral theory into practice. It’s not good enough to read, for instance, Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics or Adam Smith’s Theory of Moral Sentiments without thinking about how to apply their moral principles to day-to-day life. We believe that a free society can only be sustained if its citizenry understands and act upon certain moral virtues.

Applications for the program have exploded, showing us that young people want to think seriously and deeply about fundamental, timeless, and life-changing questions, such as: How shall I live my life? What is justice? What is freedom? What is friendship? What is the best form of government? Secondly, the response to the program shows that students are specifically interested in studying the ideas and institutions that make human flourishing and prosperity possible.

We aim to reinvigorate American higher education with a model that is both needed and that can be replicated at other universities and colleges. We hope to generate study and ideas that will be part of a new birth of freedom in America.

More information about the program is available at this link. The application deadline for Fall 2018 freshman is December 11, 2017.

Weather Stations Giving Bad Global Warming Data, A Problem Ignored A few months ago, the blogosphere and talk radio were abuzz with the story of how the nation’s various weather stations and temperature reading devices have been improperly located or badly constructed and how the data received from these improper devices must be suspected as inaccurate. Since global warming research often uses this suspect data that is gleaned from these failed stations, it must therefore call into question the accuracy of the entire theory as its conclusions are derived from likely false data. Still, even as the blogosphere and talk radio blasted the news, the MSM ignores this explosive story.

An Exclusive You Have To See: The Last Frontier of Free Press Is Here! No More Censorship, Unlike YouTube and Others!

By Lisa Haven

With all the commotion and chaos happening with immigration, Islamic terrorism and the economy, Evangelist Perry Stone has just issued a Terror Alert and a Prophetic which shouldn’t be taken lightly. With Christian persecution on the rise, one can no longer turn a blind eye to such travesty. It’s time to act and time to take a stand. When you hear what Perry Stone has to say, you just might make a few changes in your daily activities.

Here is the breaking report…

Here is the Alert in full found on Perry Stone Ministries Facebook Page left December 4th:

“TERROR ALERT: Since the 1980′s groups of Muslims have been provided finances from their governments (including Morocco) to come to America, getting visas and finding jobs, to eventually participate in an American “Jihad.” They are given a phone number to call.

There are warehouses in all 50 states with weapons, and when “the word” is given, they will be given an address to go to pick up their weaponry, and as one Muslim said, “America will burn.”

When Obama opened the Mexican border numerous Muslims, some speaking Spanish, posing as Mexican immigrants came into America. Obama is demanding to allow Syrians, (98% Muslims) to enter America – with untold numbers who could be possible terror agents.

There are hundreds of sleeper cells, including cells in Knoxville, Tennessee, Lexington, Kentucky and throughout the Southeast, including in the mountains of West Virginia. Recently, two Muslims with Kentucky tags was spotted locally video taping numerous buildings, including churches.

I received a message -connected with the U.S. military, that when a radical leaders says publically, “Last days brothers-last days,” the United States won’t know what hit them! They are targeting places around the holidays.

“It is time to get security in all malls, schools and churches, and visit “Smith and Wesson” and get your conceal and carry permit.

Report suspicious activity, and yes, get a security team that WILL PROFILE individuals when needed. Israel is not afraid to profile anyone at anytime, and this is why they have stopped numerous attacks.

When a knife wielding radical comes toward anyone in Israel, to stab them, they will be shot dead by police or a “packing” Israeli. Christians, get your head out of the sand and realize terror has come to America and it is only beginning.

Benjamin Netanyahu told me, “They will use your laws to get inside the country then use your freedoms against you!”

There is much but I will restrain from sharing it on an open page. Please PREPOST THIS to everyone – to be alert and be in prayer and ask God to expose these ungodly and dangerous individuals – and God bless our MILITARY and GOD BLESS ALL POLICE OFFICERS who are doing their job!

I am counting the days when the incompetent D.C. leadership will be replaced – hopefully with someone who will defend the nation, the Constitution, and stop the non-sense we have endured for 7 years!”

He also issued a Prophecy Alert this morning, December 8th:

“PROPHECY ALERT: Will the dollar be replaced? Several years ago a person within inside connections to the Federal Reserve, sent me pictures of a prototype new currency that was being planned in the future for the North American Republic – consisting of Canada, New Mexico and America.

It included all levels of currency (ones, fives, tens, twenties, etc.) with Spanish, English and French words disrobing the amount – readable in the language spoken in all three countries.

There was a blue flag with three stars and bar codes on each bill that could trace how much $ your were carrying through scanners.

With the IMF allowing the Chinese Yuan to be accepted as a global currency to compete with the dollar, China will likely manipulate the interest rates on borrowing to zero and do other “tricks” to make their currency the new global currency to replace the dollar.

Should this occur and the dollar value plummets, look down the road for a new replacement currency within the United States that will connect the three nations mentioned above.

This replacement will also bring all cash that is in hiding to the surface, since the old currency will be replaced – similar to what Germany did with the German Marks in the 1920′s.

Our national debt is so high, that we are one major disaster away from a national crisis. John Kerry accidentally let the words, “North America Republic” slip a few months ago.

I will be showing the currency and giving inside information from IMF bankers about secret plans occurring next year at our Prophecy Conference in April during our “closed door session.”

There are just things I refuse to discuss on Facebook for numerous reasons. Repost this if you wish. Don’t forget I’m preaching at OCI tonight.”

7893,8959,Fluoride Content Of Bottled Water,"Source: www.fluoridealert.org | Original Post Date: August 2012 –

As with other fresh water supplies (e.g., spring water, lake water, river water), bottled waters have low levels of fluoride. Fresh surface water contains an average of just 0.05 ppm. To put this in perspective, artificially fluoridated water (using industrial-grade fluoride chemicals) contains 0.7 to 1.2 ppm fluoride, which is 14 to 24 times more than the average natural level.

Since most bottled water is derived from fresh surface water sources, it is not surprising to find that the levels in bottled water are generally very low. According to the USDA, the average level of fluoride in bottled water is 0.11 ppm. (USDA 2005). Less than 10% of bottled waters contain more than 0.3 ppm.

Although some fluoride proponents claim that the increased use of bottled water could be an explanation for the increase in tooth decay being seen in young children today. This, however, is a dubious claim. As an American Dental Association spokesman, Dr. Jonathan Shenkin, conceded in August 2012, “there has been no research to show using bottled water causes tooth decay.” In fact, the limited research that has been conducted has found no relationship between bottled water consumption and tooth decay — a finding consistent with other recent evidence on the ineffectiveness of fluoridated drinking water.

Fluoride Levels in Bottled Water

The following are the recorded fluoride levels in several popular bottled water brands sold in the United States. If the bottled water brand that you purchase is not included on this list, you can find out the fluoride level by calling the company, as this is information they should have readily available.

DATA FROM: USDA (2005)

DATA FROM: BASSIN (2001)

See also:

“[R]ecent analyses of bottled water samples [unpublished Iowa Fluoride Study (IFS) data from 2000 to 2004] show that 91 percent of the 103 samples assayed had fluoride levels under 0.3ppm, 3 percent with 0.3 to 0.7ppm, 5 percent at optimal fluoridation levels (0.7 to 1.2ppm), and 1 percent beyond optimal (1.33ppm).”

7871,8937,The slime pit known as Washington D.C.,"Please allow me to familiarize you good people with the slimy denizens of D.C., and some of their nest feathering practices while sticking it to us big time.

To call Washington D. C. a Den of Thieves would be the understatement of the Millennium.

We will start with Pelosi, whose husband owns $17 million worth of stock of StarKist Tuna, which is owned by Del Monte Foods who is a big contributor to Pelosi.

Starkist is the major employer in American Samoa, employing 75% of the Samoan work force.

In January 2007 when the minimum wage was increased from $5.15 to $7.25 Ms. Pelosi had American Samoa exempted from the increase so Del Monte would not have to pay the higher wage. This would make Del Monte products less expensive than that of its competitors.

Pelosi added a $33 million dollar earmark for an economic development credit in American Samoa, and she called the Bush administration CORRUPT?

Moving right along, another California Democrat, Senator Diane Feinstein despite a blatantly obvious conflict of interest, as “a member of the Military Construction Appropriations subcommittee, Senator Feinstein voted for appropriations worth some $3.7 billion dollars to her husband’s firms.”

The House Appropriations Chairman David Obey (D-WI) is earmarking $2 billion dollars related to his son’s lobbying efforts. His son Craig Obey, is “a top lobbyist for a non-profit group which would receive $2 billion dollars worth of the stimulus package.

I could go on but I think you get the idea.

To add insult to injury however, not only do we not get a cost of living allowance (COLA) for the next three years, but these slimy mamzers get a $4,700.00 cost of living raise while we get bupkus, and let’s go a step further, I live on a military pension which is little enough coupled with my social security, I arose this morning and checked my bank balance by phone as I do every morning (a good idea in this age of identity theft) only to find that my automatic deposit is now a lesser amount than it was last month. Not by much grant you, but multiply that by the number of retired military members receiving benefits and that adds up to some serious money. I guess the elite snakes in Washington don’t think we are paying our fair share, (we have already paid our dues you jackasses).

Tim Geithner didn’t pay $34,000.00 which he owed (and he is secretary of the treasury) so why should we have to pay?

Charlie Rangel overlooked $75,000.00 worth of income, and he is the snake that writes our tax laws, if he didn’t pay why should we have to pay?

Tom Daschle owed $140,000.00 which he sort of overlooked, if he didn’t pay why should we have to pay? Are you happy with the change some of you voted for?

The usurper in chief is not only not up to the job, he has no clue what the hell he is doing and the inept clowns he has surrounded himself with don’t have a clue either. A good example is his little speech about the almost Delta disaster all he can do is look very stern and say something stupid like “This is totally unacceptable”. Okay it is unacceptable, we know that, the question is what the hell are you going to do about it?

Correction Requested:

Regarding the article “The slime pit known as Washington, D.C.” on Friday, January 1 by Aaron Cantor, I would like to correct several factual errors:



Del Monte Foods no longer owns StarKist. The brand was officially sold to Dongwon Industries in early October, 2008.

Del Monte Foods has not contributed to Speaker Pelosi. Because Del Monte Foods does not operate a Political Action Committee (a requirement for federal election donations), the Company has not made a direct political contribution to any elected official or candidate for office.

Regarding the issue of minimum wage in American Samoa, Del Monte Foods has not lobbied Speaker Pelosi’s office nor participated in any lobbying regarding the financial bailout bill. Specifically, we did not participate in any lobbying regarding any American Samoa provisions that were included in the bailout bill.



We respectfully request a correction. Thank you for your attention to this matter.



Sincerely,



Serena

342,405,Hideous Building Gets A Pass Because Owner Says It’s ‘Art Deco’,"CLANCY OVERELL | Editor | Contact

The owners of a visually displeasing house in Betoota’s old Meatworkers district have been praised by local council for keeping the building just as ugly as it was when it was built in the 1940s.

Situated at number 3 Daroo street, the house has had only three owners since it first began violating the eyes of the locals, and has retained it’s same Californian-style sky-blue colour for the entire duration.

Despite even the owners themselves admitting that the architecture hasn’t aged well, they refuse to alter it in any way – at the advice of a few smug local art and design historians.

“Yeah” says the owner.

“It’s Art Deco”

Art Deco, sometimes referred to as Deco, is a style of visual arts, architecture and design that first appeared in France just before World War I. Art Deco influenced the design of buildings, furniture, jewellery, fashion, cars, movie theatres, trains, ocean liners, and everyday objects such as radios and vacuum cleaners. It took its name, short for Arts Décoratifs, from the Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes held in Paris in 1925.

It is this particular style that has millions of inner-suburban streets around Australia fall victim to the circular concrete facades and tall Baptist church-style windows made popular between the world wars.

It combined modernist styles with fine craftsmanship and rich materials. During its heyday, Art Deco represented luxury, glamour, exuberance, and faith in social and technological progress – nowadays the term is generally used to excuse ugly buildings that are being assessed for a heritage listing.",http://www.betootaadvocate.com/humans-of-betoota/hideous-building-gets-pass-owner-says-art-deco/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

9213,10411,Shutdown forces delay of hearings on Trump offshore drilling plan,"The Trump administration has postponed public hearings scheduled this week for its controversial offshore drilling plan because of the partial government shutdown.

The hearings were scheduled, Monday through Thursday, in Augusta, Maine; Baton Rouge, La.; Anchorage, Alaska; Concord, N.H.; Boston; Montgomery, Ala.; and Providence, R.I.

“A lapse in funding means that a number of government activities have ceased due to a lack of appropriated funding and because a number of employees have been temporarily furloughed,” the Interior Department's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, the agency in charge of the offshore leasing plan, said in a press release Monday.

The agency will announce new dates for the hearings when the government resumes normal operations. The Senate on Monday voted to re-open the government, paving the way to end the three-day standoff.

The Interior Department published its draft five-year offshore drilling plan in the Federal Register on Jan. 8, proposing to open nearly all federal waters to oil and natural gas drilling.

Almost all coastal state governors have protested the plan and vowed to challenge it in court. Critics were incensed after Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke granted Florida an exemption, just one day after announcing the plan.

mises.org / Ludwig von Mises / December 25, 2017

From “The Exhaustion of the Reserve Fund” in Human Action, Chapter XXXVI by Ludwig von Mises:

The idea underlying all interventionist policies is that the higher income and wealth of the more affluent part of the population is a fund which can be freely used for the improvement of the conditions of the less prosperous. The essence of the interventionist policy is to take from one group to give to another. It is confiscation and distribution. Every measure is ultimately justified by declaring that it is fair to curb the rich for the benefit of the poor.

In the field of public finance progressive taxation of incomes and estates is the most characteristic manifestation of this doctrine. Tax the rich and spend the revenue for the improvement of the condition of the poor, is the principle of contemporary budgets. In the field of industrial relations shortening the hours of work, raising wages, and a thousand other measures are recommended under the assumption that they favor the employee and burden the employer. Every issue of government and community affairs is dealt with exclusively from the point of view of this principle.

An illustrative example is provided by the methods applied in the operation of nationalized and municipalized enterprises. These enterprises very often result in financial failure; their accounts regularly show losses burdening the state or the city treasury. It is of no use to investigate whether the deficits are due to the notorious inefficiency of the public conduct of business enterprises or, at least partly, to the inadequacy of the prices at which the commodities or services are sold to the customers. What matters more is the fact that the taxpayers must cover these deficits. The interventionists fully approve of this arrangement. They passionately reject the two other possible solutions: selling the enterprises to private entrepreneurs or raising the prices charged to the customers to such a height that no further deficit remains. The first of these proposals is in their eyes manifestly reactionary because the inevitable trend of history is toward more and more socialization. The second is deemed “antisocial” because it places a heavier load upon the consuming masses. It is fairer to make the taxpayers, i.e., the wealthy citizens, bear the burden. Their ability to pay is greater than that of the average people riding the nationalized railroads and the municipalized subways, trolleys, and busses. To ask that such public utilities should be self-supporting, is, say the interventionists, a relic of the old-fashioned ideas of orthodox finance. One might as well aim at making the roads and the public schools self-supporting.

42,52,'Destiny 2' News: Bungie Addresses Player Complaints Around Faction Rally's Redundant Rewards,"Facebook/DestinyTheGame Promo image for ""Destiny 2's"" first DLC ""Curse of Osiris.""

""Destiny 2's"" Faction Rallies was one of the major events in the game that debuted recently. However, they did not run as smoothly as Bungie may have hoped.

Bungie was recently prompted to issue an apology to ""Destiny 2"" gamers after many of them noticed that they had received far less new weapons after winning in the Faction Rallies for Season 2. Meanwhile, other players also complained of receiving redundant loot items upon redeeming their Faction Engrams.

The game developer has since recognized these feedback from fans and explained that they had applied a new mechanism of distributing new weapons in the Faction Rallies for Season 2.

""It was not made clear beforehand that the new Season 2 weapons would be added throughout the events of the Season rather than all at once in the beginning. This was on us. No excuses,"" Bungie explained in a community forum.

In a separate statement explaining the distribution of new weapons in upcoming Faction Rallies, Bungie confirmed that each Faction would receive five new weapons which, as mentioned, would be handed out all throughout the event.

Bungie explained that the weapon rewards, called Winner's Offering, will be changed to a new type as a new Faction Rally event takes place.

The Auto Rifle Winner's Offering for the first rally has already been made available. As for the second rally, the same rule applies and Bungie added: ""Additionally, the previous Winner's offering (Auto Rifles) and an additional weapon are added to Faction Engram rewards.""

Meanwhile, the game developer promised that the third and final Faction Rally in season 2 will also call for a new weapon ""that has yet to be featured.""

""The previous Winner's Offering will be added to the Faction Engram rewards, alongside an additional weapon. This brings the total to four weapons within the Faction Engram, and a final Winner's Offering for factions to compete for over the course of the event,"" Bungie further explained.

Recently, Bungie was also criticized by ""Destiny 2"" players after they imposed a restriction in the number of chest rewards that can be claimed. The developer has since explained that this had been done to address an exploit that allowed players to harvest loots in the Lost Sector at a rate much faster than Bungie preferred.

However, Bungie agreed with players that the remedy they had applied ""is way too penalizing"" and promised to fix it in an upcoming patch.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/destiny-2-news-bungie-responds-to-complaints-on-faction-rallys-redundant-rewards-214630/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
83,102,Professor Conducts Libation to Summon Spirits of Blacks Killed by Police in Hollywood Church,"(Screenshot: Facebook) Dr. Melina Abdullah, professor and chair of Pan-African studies at California State University gets ready to summon the spiritual energy of victims of officer involved shootings at the Hollywood United Methodist Church in Hollywood , California, on Thursday January 11, 2018.

Dr. Melina Abdullah, professor and chair of Pan-African Studies at California State University, recently conducted a libation ceremony inside the Hollywood United Methodist Church to summon the spiritual energy of dead civil rights leaders and other blacks who died at the hands of police officers.

Author and Christian scholar Dr. Hamilton Ayuk argued on his blog that the pouring of libation to honor any spirit other than the God of the Bible is contrary to Scripture.

Speaking at the church where advocates had gathered to discuss their opposition to a $3.5 billion jail expansion plan in Los Angeles County along with the issue of mass incarceration, Abdullah, who is one of the original organizers of the Black Lives Matter movement, argued that because the issue of mass incarceration was also a spiritual struggle, it was important to conduct the libation ritual to summon the energy of those who had died in the struggle for civil rights.

""This is not just a social justice, a racial justice, an economic justice struggle,"" Abdullah said. ""This is also a spiritual struggle, so it's appropriate that we're here in this setting (a church). And it's also important that we summon the right energy into this space no matter what faith you are. We have to understand what the struggle is about.""

She continued: ""Making sure that jails don't expand is a first step. We don't want cages at all. Our people don't belong in cages at all. And we understand that there is a direct relationship, our ancestors demand that we engage in this work because as an African person in this country we know we were brought over here as chattel and once they banned the slave plantations, many of those plantations were warped into prisons so they continue to enslave us. So this is ancestral and spiritual work that we must do. So we are going to pour libation in the names of our ancestors, in the names of those who struggle right now.""

She then proceeded to pour what appeared to be bottled water as she summoned the energy of the dead while declaring ""ashe.""

""We summon those spirits that are still with us. We summon those people whose bodies have been stolen, but whose souls are still here,"" she said. ""We call on Wakiesha Wilson. We call on George Jackson ... Eric Garner ...""

""And all of those whose bodies have been stolen: We ask that you be with us. We ask that you work through us. We ask that we do righteous work on your behalf,"" Abdullah continued inside the church.

""We call on Martin Luther King into this space. Brother Malcom [X], we call you into this space. Ashe. ... Nat Turner, into this space. Ashe. Mother Harriet Tubman. Ashe. We call you all into this space. We ask that you work through us. That you give us power; that the Creator give us power when we come together. This victory is assured. Ashe. Ashe. Ashe,"" she ended.

The practice of libation is a common practice in some African-American churches like Unity Fellowship Church of Baltimore where they conduct the ritual to ""honor the ancestors. Those who in one way or another helped us to get to where we are today.""

According to Dr. Ayuk, however, while libation can be found in the Bible it was ""done as a form of worship to God and not gods.""

Heathens, he said, ""copied the practice and when Israel strayed from God, they took the ritual to heathen gods"" and most African communities currently pour libation as a part of their tradition.

""The practice is said to have begun in Israel when Jacob intended to appease God with a drink offering and oil (Gen 35:14). Although from Genesis 1-35 there is a mirror that captured the culture of the surrounding nations, there is no indication any of them performed the ritual before this time,"" Ayuk wrote.

""Drifting away from God has nefarious consequences. Perhaps that is why most African countries entrenched in ancestral worship are backwards because they seem to invite more the wrath rather than the favor of God. From Africa to Asia, Latin America to Europe and North America to Central America, there is enough evidence that abandoning the ways of God will fetch us disaster now and hell fire in the world to come,"" Ayuk added.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/professor-conducts-libation-to-summon-spirits-of-blacks-killed-by-police-in-hollywood-church-214285/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
84,103,'Ghost Ship' With 8 Dead N. Koreans Washes Up in Japan During 'Unified Korea' Flag Announcement,"(Photo: Reuters) The teams of North and South Korea march into the stadium during the opening ceremony at the Torino 2006 Winter Olympic Games in Turin, Italy.

While news of North and South Korea agreeing to march under a ""unified Korea"" flag at the upcoming Winter Olympics has sparked hopes for peace, a grim reminder of the harshness of life in the North washed up on the shores of Japan in a ""ghost ship"" that contained eight skeletal remains.

AFP reported on Tuesday that coastguards in Japan found the decomposing corpses of seven men inside the wreckage of a ship that washed up in Kanazawa, with the remains of another man discovered 50 feet from the boat.

Senior police official Hiroshi Abe said that ""it is difficult to identify the bodies as they had begun to decompose.""

While Abe said it is yet to be confirmed that the boat came from North Korea, CNN said police also found a badge with the likenesses of North Korean leaders Kim Jong Il and Kim Il Sung inside the boat, along with a cigarette box with Korean letters.

As many as 113 suspected North Korean vessels dubbed ""ghost ships"" washed up in Japan in 2017, carrying the decomposing bodies of 43 people.

The victims are believed to be mostly fishing crews driven by hunger and desperation further out into the sea between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.

Several North Korean defectors spoke last year about the extreme poverty and starvation gripping many citizens under Kim Jong Un's regime. Christians suffer heavily there too, and are often sent to prison camps or executed if their faith is discovered.

The discovery of this year's first ghost ship coincides with news that North and South Korea will march under the same flag for the opening of the Winter Olympic games, which will take place between Feb. 9–25 in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

BBC News reported that the two countries will also field a joint women's ice hockey team.

While the apparent thawing in relations means that the cross-border road between the two nations will be opened for the first time in two years, some, such as Japan's Foreign Minister Taro Kono, have warned against North Korea's sudden ""charm offensive.""

""It is not the time to ease pressure or to reward North Korea,"" Kono said, according to Reuters.

""The fact that North Korea is engaging in dialogue could be interpreted as proof that the sanctions are working,"" he added, referring to heavy international sanctions against the North.

Just last month Kim Jong Un was still issuing grave warnings against the United States, and said during his New Year's Day speech that his country has the capability to hit U.S. mainland with nuclear weapons.

""The entire United States is within range of our nuclear weapons, and a nuclear button is always on my desk. This is reality, not a threat,"" Kim said.

""This year we should focus on mass producing nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles for operational deployment,"" the North Korean leader added. ""These weapons will be used only if our security is threatened.""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/ghost-ship-with-8-dead-north-koreans-washes-up-japan-unified-korea-flag-announcement-214259/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
85,104,Facebook Lifts Ban on Paid Ads for Pro-Life Film Produced by MLK's Niece After Appeal,"(Photo: Reuters/Dado Ruvic) Facebook.

UPDATE 11:40 a.m. ET Jan. 18: Facebook said Thursday that it has lifted its ban on paid ads for a fundraising effort connected to Alveda King's upcoming documentary that highlights the ""real untold story"" of abortion in the United States and the history of eugenics associated with Planned Parenthood.

In an emailed statement to The Christian Post, Facebook said the pro-life ad was originally disapproved in error and was correctly approved upon appeal. At this time, all ads connected to the ""Roe v. Wade"" movie page are running.

Facebook also said that abilities of all the administrators for the page will be fully restored after being temporarily blocked for so-called ""spam behavior.""

Original report:

Martin Luther King Jr.'s niece is speaking out against Facebook's decision to ban paid ads for a fundraising effort connected to her upcoming documentary that highlights the ""real untold story"" of abortion in the United States and the history of eugenics associated with Planned Parenthood.

Alveda King, a prominent Christian conservative and pro-life activist who serves as director of civil rights for the unborn at Priests for Life, spoke with Family Research Council's Tony Perkins during a special National Religious Freedom Day broadcast of his radio show on Tuesday and explained that Facebook pulled down paid ads and is blocking shares for her upcoming film, ""Roe v, Wade.""

Named after the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized elective abortions, the documentary stars Hollywood actor Jon Voight and is said to be the first movie ever to expose ""the real untold story of how people lied; how the media lied; and how the courts were manipulated to pass a law that has since killed over 60 million Americans.""

Expand | Collapse (Photo: Reuters/Mary F. Calvert) Alveda King, founder of Alveda King Ministries, speaks during an ""I Have a Dream"" Gospel brunch at the Willard InterContinental Hotel in Washington, D.C., on August 25, 2013.

""There is a new movie coming out — 'Roe v. Wade.' I am one of the executive producers. Facebook has pulled down our ads, the paid ads and any mention of the non-paid ads,"" King said while addressing the topic of religious freedom. ""They do not want the message of the injustice of abortion broadcast and they are trying to block that.""

King is referring to Facebook's blocking of ads promoting the movie's Indiegogo crowdfunding account. Thus far, the movie has raised just under $44,000 out of its stated goal of $2 million.

""That is another violation of religious freedom. It's very discriminatory,"" she continued. ""So, when we are denied the opportunity and the right to proclaim the Gospel freely in this nation that was founded upon ... that right, it's a terrible injustice. My uncle did say injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. I know we can all agree. It's wrong to take the life of a baby in the womb. It's wrong to silence those voices of people who want to proclaim our faith and all of those aren't just civil rights injustices, but they are an injustice against God's will.""

According to an update on the crowdfunding page, ""Facebook has banned us from inviting friends to 'Like' our page and from 'Sharing' our PAID ads.""

The Christian Post has reached out to Facebook for comment on the situation. A response is pending.

""It is outrageous that Facebook purports to be apolitical when there have been trends of blocking pages of conservative causes, such as our 'Roe v. Wade' movie page,"" fellow executive producer Jalesia McQueen told Breitbart in a statement.

The news comes as Facebook is frequently criticized for having bias against and censoring conservative Christians.

Earlier this month, Facebook unpublished the popular Facebook page of Warriors for Christ ministry, which had over 225,000 followers and spoke critically of things like homosexuality, transgenderism and abortion. Facebook told The Christian Post that the page was removed because it violated its policies on hate speech and bullying.

Additionally, Facebook refused to take action this week after popular Christian mommy blogger Elizabeth Johnston, best known as ""The Activist Mommy,"" voiced concern with a Facebook group that was titled ""I will find Activist Mommy and burn whoever runs it alive.""

Officials of the social media giant ruled that the group did not violate Facebook community standards because it was determined that the group was ""satirical.""

""With 2 billion users, it can be argued that Facebook has become a public utility and thus cannot discriminate against users based upon their political or religious views,"" Johnston told CP on Tuesday. ""Conservative users who don't tow the liberal line on issues like Islam, abortion, and homosexuality are repeatedly banned and silenced in an Orwellian manner for expressing their valid concerns, thus causing conservatives to cry out for an alternative platform that welcomes the free exchange of ideas.""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/facebook-bans-paid-ads-pro-life-film-produced-by-mlk-niece-214143/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
86,105,"Iranian Christian Convert Leads 1,500 Muslims to Christ in Sweden","(Screencap: YouTube/Tidningen Dagen) Annahita Parsan (L), minister in the Church of Sweden, in a video posted on April 28, 2017.

An Iranian convert to Christianity who is now an ordained minister in the Church of Sweden says she has helped bring nearly 1,500 Muslims to Christ over the past five years.

Annahita Parsan told Fox News in a report on Wednesday that her life, which has undergone huge tribulations, is ""completely different since coming to Jesus.""

The minister said she was raised in a Muslim home in Iran and married at 16, though a couple of years later her husband was killed in a car accident.

She had to fight for custody for her son, which she successfully won, and two years later was re-married to a man whose wife had died.

Her second husband started beating her son, and although she wanted a divorce it was impossible for her to do because she was pregnant with a second child.

Parsan, her daughter, and the rest of the family fled as refugees in 1984 in the wake of the Iran-Iraq conflict, but met great hardships, including spending a month in prison in Turkey because they did not have identification papers or passports.

Eventually they made it to Denmark, which is where Parsan started learning more about Jesus Christ.

""In about the first or second month there, a woman came to the door to speak about God. But it was not in my interest,"" Parsan said. ""I was so angry, I was so unhappy. But she came back the next day with a small Bible, so this time I asked Jesus to help me.""

She started reading the Bible, which she had to keep secret from her husband, and grew in the faith. But her family life only got worse and she attempted to take her own life by overdosing on sleeping pills after her husband physically attacked her.

She survived the assault and that was when she woke up in a hospital and realized she was being called for greater things.

""I was too scared to go home and the police came to the hospital to talk to me. Many people were helping me find a safe place to live, and I knew it was Jesus,"" Parsan recalled.

""And soon, the police called to tell me that they had uncovered a plot in which my abusive husband had planned to kidnap the children back to Iran. After that, we moved to Sweden, and the policeman told me that I have an angel on my shoulder.""

Two years after moving to Sweden she was baptized in the Christian faith. In 2006, she survived a car accident, which is when she said she realized God spared her life so that she could help Muslims come to Christ.

In 2012, Parson became a minister in the Church of Sweden, focusing much of her work on reaching out to the Muslim community and inviting them to explore the faith.

She has helped as many as 1,500 come to Christ in the past five years, she estimates, despite risks to her life.

""I have serious threats at least a couple of times per year, a threat of a knife attack or a bomb attack. I have a police officer attached to my case I can always call, and we have security during our services. I have other threats from my own distant family members,"" she revealed. ""But for me, what I do is worth it.""

Christians back in Iran meanwhile continue suffering intense persecution for their faith, believers have said, despite the claims of a prominent bishop who attempted to argue that they ""enjoy complete freedom.""

Bishop Sibo Sarkisian, the Armenian-Orthodox Bishop of Tehran, said last month that Iran grants Christian citizens ""every right to practice their faith, including observing their feasts such as Christmas,"" and said that the only thing they are prohibited from doing is sharing their faith publicly.

Mohabat News, which says it is the news agency of Iranian Christians, pointed out, however, that for millions of believers, including the growing numbers in Iran, evangelism is a biblical mandate, and is an essential part of the faith.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/iranian-christian-convert-leads-1500-muslims-christ-sweden-214267/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
87,106,Justice Dept. Says DC Metro Violated Religious Freedom of Archdiocese by Blocking Christmas Ads,"(Screenshot: YouTube / MJofLakeland1) A Metro bus crosses an intersection out front of the Paul S. Sarbanes Transit Center in Silver Spring, Maryland in a video posted to YouTube on Apr 10, 2016.

The United States Justice Department said that the Washington, D.C. public transit system violated the free speech rights of the Catholic Archdiocese of Washington by refusing to place it's Christmas advertisement on the side of Metro buses.

The Department of Justice filed a 14-page amicus brief with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia on Tuesday in defense of the archdiocese, which is suing the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority after its bus advertisement for the ""Find the Perfect Gift"" Christmas campaign was rejected.

The advertisement showed a silhouette of three shepherds and their sheep under a starry night. The advertisement also promoted the website, ""FindthePerfectGift.org."" Upon clicking the link, the page reads ""Jesus is the perfect gift.""

WMATA maintained that the ad was rejected because it violated guidelines that state that advertisements may not promote or oppose and religion or belief.

The archdiocese filed a lawsuit against the agency in November. However, a federal judge in December sided with WMATA, saying that the agency has the right to ban posters that have religious content. Although the Christmas season has ended, the archdiocese is continuing its legal battle because it intends to place similar ads in the future and wants WMATA's policy struck down.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions' Justice Department is now asking the Court of Appeals to overturn the federal judge's ruling.

""WMATA's rejection of the Archdiocese's proposed Christmas advertisement in this case falls squarely within the class of viewpoint discrimination ....,"" the Justice Department brief reads. ""In the context of Christmas advertising, WMATA's guidelines permit messages which generally express commercial or charitable viewpoints, but exclude messages that express religious viewpoints.""

""Had Macy's, for example, sought to run a Christmas-themed ad stating, 'Find the Perfect Gift,' and displaying an image of its jewelry, nothing in the guidelines would prohibit the company from doing so. But because the Archdiocese's proposal arguably conveyed the implicit message that 'JESUS is the perfect gift,' WMATA rejected it,"" the brief continued. ""An ad proclaiming that the perfect Christmas gift is jewelry and another that the perfect Christmas gift is Jesus obviously offer competing perspectives on the meaning of the holiday, yet WMATA permits only the former.""

The Justice Department argues that the the application of WMATA's guidelines is ""precisely the type of viewpoint discrimination"" that the Supreme Court precluded in the 1995 case of Rosenberger v. University of Virginia, in which the court ruled that the public school may not withhold funding from a Christian student publication that is otherwise available to secular student publications.

""As the Supreme Court has made clear, the First Amendment prohibits the government from discriminating against religious viewpoints,"" Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand said in a statement. ""By rejecting the Archdiocese's advertisement while allowing other Christmas advertisements, WMATA engaged in unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination.""

According to the Washingtonian magazine, Metro's policy was revised after Pamela Geller of the American Freedom Defense Initiative attempted to place ads featuring cartoon depictions of the Muslim prophet Muhammad.

Since taking office in 2017, Sessions and President Donald Trump have vowed to promote religious liberty. Last October, Sessions issued a sweeping order on religious freedom, calling on federal agencies to ensure that the religious freedom of people and organizations are protected to the ""greatest extent practicable and permitted by law.""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/justice-dept-dc-metro-violated-religious-freedom-archdiocese-blocking-christmas-ads-214140/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

A Chick-fil-A restaurant in Fargo, North Dakota, is asking for forgiveness following a controversial decision to kick out a mother for breast-feeding her child, with the owner being accused of telling the woman that men can see her ""indecency.""

Macy Hornung, the mother, wrote in a Facebook message on Sunday that she was told to leave the restaurant after staff saw her breast-feeding her baby.

""The owner came to our table where I was showing no more than the upper portion of my breast, barely more than what was visible in my shirt and asked me to cover. I tried to explain that I couldn't, because my baby refuses to be covered and she started harping about the children and men who can see my indecency and I need to cover,"" Hornung explained.

""I said they could practice the simple art of looking away and tried to cite North Dakota breast-feeding laws. She told me if I chose not to cover, then she would have to ask me to leave, so I told her my review would reflect my experience and I would be relaying the experience in every local mommy group,"" she added.

Later the same day Kimberly Flamm, the owner of the store in question, posted a Facebook message of her own where she apologized for the incident.

""I would like to publicly apologize to Macy Hornung for the way I handled the situation on Saturday,"" Flamm wrote.

""I ask for your forgiveness on this matter as I learn from it. My goal is to provide a warm and welcoming environment for all of my guests.""

The situation continues to spark debates online, with some stating that breast-feeding is not something to be done in a public restaurant.

""I personally do not want to see a mother breast-feed her child while I am trying to eat my lunch or dinner. I think she only did this to see how far she could push the envelope. I have nothing against breast-feeding but in a public restaurant is not one of them,"" one person wrote.

Others, such as Lindzey Dianna, pushed back.

""I'm shocked at some of the comments on here. Are people really that stupid they would get offended over a baby eating? You have 360 degrees to which you can direct your vision, if a mom feeding her child offends you so much, then avert to the remaining 359. If you're still overcome by the awful egregious site of a breast, then you can try eating in the bathroom or your car,"" she wrote.

Debate over breast-feeding was stirred in Christian circles last year as well, when a mother attending an Elevation Church campus in the Ballantyne neighborhood of Charlotte said that she was told to go feed her child in the ladies room, instead of the sanctuary during service.

""I just got kicked out of church for breast-feeding with a cover on and directed to the bathroom. Shame on you Elevation,"" mother Amanda Zilliken wrote on Facebook in August.

Elevation Church released a statement after a GoFundMe campaign began collecting money online to help Zilliken file a lawsuit.

""We do not have a policy that nursing mothers can't be in the sanctuary,"" the statement clarified.

""A volunteer had a conversation and felt both parties arrived at the same conclusion to exit mutually. We are sorry that this in any way offended anyone. We welcome everyone and anyone to attend Elevation Church.""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/chick-fil-a-kicks-out-breastfeeding-mom-warning-men-can-see-her-indecency-214254/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

Numerous conservative groups and more than a hundred members of Congress have filed amicus briefs urging the United States Supreme Court to strike down a California law that compels pro-life centers to promote abortion.

The highest court in the nation is scheduled to hear arguments in the case of National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra.

A brief signed by 144 members of Congress from both parties argued that California's law, known as the Reproductive Freedom, Accountability, Comprehensive Care, and Transparency (FACT) Act, was ""unconstitutional.""

Expand | Collapse (Photo: REUTERS/Jessica Rinaldi) Executive Director of Alternatives Pregnancy Center Janet Lyons points to a plastic replica of a fetus at twelve weeks which is used to show women who come into the center to find out if they are pregnant and what the stage of growth looks like, in Waterloo, Iowa, July 6, 2011.

""The California law at issue compels pregnancy centers opposed to abortion—and only those opposed to abortion—to comply with burdensome requirements that force these centers to provide nonmedical information that contradicts their core message and moral beliefs,"" read the brief, filed Tuesday.

""... the FACT Act is a viewpoint-based regulation of speech. It is therefore unconstitutional unless it can surpass strict scrutiny. Tellingly, no government has ever succeeded in an attempt to justify a speech regulation that discriminates based on viewpoint.""

David French, a popular conservative columnist, filed a brief Monday on behalf of 41 conservative groups, arguing that the California law violated the moral conscience of pro-life activists.

""The State of California directly interferes with their work by forcing them to post messages actively opposed to their lifesaving efforts,"" argued French.

""It is hard to imagine a greater imposition on individual conscience. It is hard to imagine a more repugnant form of forced speech.""

A brief filed by groups including the National Association of Evangelicals, Concerned Women for America, the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, and Samaritan's Purse called the law ""viewpoint discriminatory"" and that ""forcing private parties to communicate the State's message is unjustified and unjustifiable.""

In 2015, the California passed Assembly Bill 775 of Reproductive FACT Act. The law mandated that all licensed pregnancy health centers, among other things, include a sign that refers patients to abortion clinics.

""The notice shall state: 'California has public programs that provide immediate free or low-cost access to comprehensive family planning services (including all FDA-approved methods of contraception), prenatal care, and abortion for eligible women,'"" read AB 775.

Failure to comply with AB 775 could result in a $500 fine on the first offense and then a $1,000 fine for each offense after that.

In October 2016, a three judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the law, agreeing with a lower court decision that the FACT Act ""survives any level of scrutiny"" and ""does not discriminate based on viewpoint.""

""Instead, the Act applies to all licensed and unlicensed facilities, regardless of what, if any, objections they may have to certain family planning services,"" read the opinion.

100,120,School District Appeals Texas Cheerleaders' Bible Verse Case to State Supreme Court,"(Facebook/Support Kountze Kids Faith)

A Texas public school district is hoping the state Supreme Court will rule that high school cheerleaders don't have the constitutional right to include Bible verses on banners displayed at football games.

Kountze Independent School District filed a petition with the Texas Supreme Court on Wednesday after the Texas Court of Appeals in Beaumont ruled last year that the school district does not reserve the right to ban cheerleaders from including Christian messages on large colorful banners that the school football team runs through before the start of games.

The lower court ruled in September that the cheerleaders' signs constituted private speech, not government speech. The school district's appeal for rehearing was subsequently denied by the Beaumont court.

Attorneys for the school district have argued that the lower court's ruling goes against previous federal court precedents, such as the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court's ruling in 2011 in the case of a cheerleader at Silsbee High School who refused to cheer for an athlete who she accused of sexually assaulting her.

The court reasoned in that case that cheerleaders acted as a ""mouthpiece through which [the school district] could disseminate speech — namely, support for its athletic teams.""

""In federal court, a cheerleader who cheers at a game engages in government speech, but in state court, she engages in private speech,"" lawyer Thomas Brandt wrote in the appeal, according to the Beaumont Enterprise.

""This creates confusion for all Texas school districts,"" he said, adding that the banners ""were held by public school cheerleaders while they were cheering for the school's football team, while they were in uniform at a school-sponsored event, and while they were on the school's football field to which access was limited by the school.""

The First Liberty Institute, a religious freedom law group that is defending the cheerleaders, decried the school district's appeal.

""The Court of Appeals correctly ruled that the Kountze cheerleaders have a right to have religious speech on their run-through banners — banners on which the cheerleaders painted messages they chose, with paint they paid for, on paper they purchased. Why is the school district continuing to fight against this decision and the cheerleaders?"" First Liberty Institute lawyer Hiram Sasser said in a statement shared with The Christian Post.

""When will the school district stop filing appeal after appeal and finally accept that the cheerleaders are free to have religious speech on their run through banners?"" he questioned. ""Hopefully the Texas Supreme Court will not even require the cheerleaders to respond and thus bring an end to the school district's scorched earth litigation tactics against the Kountze cheerleaders. Enough is enough.""

The case dates back to 2012 when the Freedom From Religion Foundation, a national organization that advocates for strict adherence to separation of church and state, complained that religious messages on the run-through banners constituted a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.

According to the Beaumont Enterprise, the school district's attorneys also argue that the case is now moot because all of the original cheerleaders involved in the case have since graduated or are no longer a part of the team.

However, David Starnes, a lawyer who also represented the girls in the case, argues that the case is not moot because the mother of one of the students who didn't make the team in 2017 filed a grievance after her daughter didn't make the team. The mother claimed that her daughter didn't make the team in retaliation for suing the school district, according to the Beaumont Enterprise.

""It is remarkable that the lawyers for the Kountze School District are making the same, worn-out, rejected arguments, yet again,"" Starnes said in a statement to KFDM/Fox 4. ""Enough is enough. They are fully aware that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1969 that 'It can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.'""

""Of course the Ninth Court of appeals simply followed the law and ruled in their favor,"" Starnes continued. ""It is inexplicable that the District's lawyers continue trying to suppress the cheerleaders' constitutionally-protected religious speech, when the well-reasoned opinion of the Ninth Court of Appeals simply follows the U.S. Supreme Court law written in 1969. To do otherwise, would lead to an absurd result.

164,192,Democrat Leader Nancy Pelosi Joins Trump-Supporting Evangelicals to Advance DACA Legislation,"(Screenshot: YouTube/Washington Post) Democratic House Minority Speaker Nancy Pelosi speaking on behalf of Dreamers at a press conference on Thursday, January 18, 2018. To the right is the Reverend Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference.

Democrat House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and other Democrat members of Congress joined with conservative evangelicals, including National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference President the Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, to promote legislation to replace the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy.

At a press conference held Thursday afternoon that featured Democrat and evangelical leaders, as well as several Dreamers, or young people affected by the rescinding of DACA, former House Speaker Pelosi stated there was ""nothing partisan, nothing political"" about the effort to replace DACA.

""We know we have to address some issues that relate to border security and we hope that we can do that in very short order,"" said Pelosi, adding that ""we take hope in the commitment of President Donald Trump"" to sign any legislation brought to his desk.

""We are proud to be with our Dreamers, who make America more American, with the hope, the determination, the optimism, the insistence on making the future better for the next generation. Those are American traits.""

In his remarks, Rodriguez, who gave a prayer at Trump's inauguration, explained that President Trump cares about the well-being of the children of illegal immigrants and wants to sign legislation securing their legal status.

""The president wants to make this happen. He wants to make this happen. He's a grandfather and a father. He has expressed that to me personally in the White House: 'I don't want to harm these kids. I want to make this happen,'"" said Rodriguez.

Rodriguez also spoke about the ""clarion call"" for border security coming from both the White House and the Republican-controlled Congress.

""The wall is a physical object created by man. 800,000 human beings created in the Image of God by God,"" noted Rodriguez.

""So if we have to build a wall in order to secure and save 800,000 lives, let's make that happen as expeditiously as possible ... let's build a wall, simultaneously saving 800,000 kids.""

Also in attendance for the press conference were Bishop Harry Jackson, senior pastor of Hope Christian Church, and Congresswoman Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM), chairwoman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.

Last September, the Trump administration announced that they were rescinding the Obama-era DACA program, which temporarily protected immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally when they were children.

In a statement read to the press, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that DACA was being ""rescinded"" as it was viewed as an unlawful unilateral action on the part of the previous administration.

""This policy was implemented unilaterally to great controversy and legal concern after Congress rejected legislative proposals to extend similar benefits on numerous occasions to this same group of illegal aliens,"" stated Sessions.

""In other words, the executive branch, through DACA, deliberately sought to achieve what the legislative branch specifically refused to authorize on multiple occasions. Such an open-ended circumvention of immigration laws was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the Executive Branch.""

The full rescinding of DACA was given a six-month delay so that Congress could pass legislation on behalf of those, commonly called Dreamers, threatened with deportation once the program was gone.

Earlier this month, federal judge William Alsup of San Francisco issued a temporary block to the administration's ending of DACA, arguing that the Department of Homeland Security's ""decision to rescind DACA was based on a flawed legal premise.""

""As a result, DACA recipients who failed to renew their status by last year's deadline will have a chance to submit renewal applications. The decision does not, however, allow new applications to be submitted,"" reported the Hill.

Johnnie Moore, a religious freedom advocate and evangelical leader with strong ties to the Trump administration, helped to organize the press conference.

In a statement posted to Twitter, Moore explained that ""nearly every Republican, as well as @POTUS himself, believe this is the just thing to do.""

""It is the job of Congress to make laws & not according to their opinions but the opinions of their constituents. Our system demands compromise. We encourage & pray for a #DACADeal,"" added Moore.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/democrat-nancy-pelosi-trump-evangelicals-daca-legislation-dreamers-214289/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

A Christian couple arrested for torture and child endangerment after their 13 children were rescued from their filthy home on the weekend only allowed the severely malnourished children to eat once a day and one shower a year, according to law enforcement officials.

""They were not being fed and they were living in filthy, dirty conditions. That's gonna take its toll,"" said Captain Greg Fellows of the Riverside County Sheriff's Department at a press conference.

The children of David Allen Turpin, 57, and his 49-year-old wife, Louise Anna Turpin, were rescued from their home in Perris, California, on Sunday after their emaciated 17-year-old daughter escaped and alerted police that her siblings were being held captive by her parents.

""Further investigation revealed several children shackled to their beds with chains and padlocks in dark and foul-smelling surroundings, but the parents were unable to immediately provide a logical reason why their children were restrained in that manner,"" police said in a press release.

What was even more shocking, they say, was that seven of the 13 victims who ranged in age from 2 to 29 were adults 18 and older.

An official with knowledge of the case told NBC News that the four-bedroom home where they lived was like a prison and reeked of urine. All of the children are reportedly being treated for severe malnutrition at local hospitals and doctors are worried they could go into shock. As soon as their conditions improve, psychologists are expected to be brought in to evaluate them.

David Turpin's 81-year-old mother, Betty Turpin, said it's difficult to believe what was happening in her son's house because she felt he and his wife were ""model Christians.""

""I feel they were model Christians. It's hard to believe all of this. Over the years, (only) the Lord knows what happened,"" she told the Daily Breeze. ""I'm not just a bragging parent. We raised two sons. They never gave us any problem, never got on drugs. ... (We) kept them in church. We never had to make them go to church.""

David Turpin's brother, Randy Turpin, who has been president of the Pentecostal Valor Christian College since 2015, has asked for privacy as he deals with the revelations about the family of his estranged brother.

""The Valor Christian College community joins with millions of Americans who are shocked and saddened by these terrible stories from California and we are praying for the full recovery of all involved,"" the Ohio school said on behalf of their president who has taken a sabbatical to deal with the family crisis.

Betty Turpin, who lives in Princeton, West Virginia, told the Daily Breeze that she vacationed with her son and his wife six years ago and she cannot reconcile the police report with her experience then.

""They are the sweetest family,"" she said. ""They were just like any ordinary family. And they had such good relationships. I'm not just saying this stuff. These kids, we were amazed. They were 'sweetie' this and 'sweetie' that to each other.""

Elizabeth Jane Flores, who is Louise Turpin's estranged sister, said she tried for years to get in touch with the children but their parents would not allow it.

""I want to reach out to the kids, I want them to know that for years we begged to Skype, we begged to see them, the whole family,"" she told ABC News' ""Good Morning America"" through tears.

""I was shocked because my sister and I haven't really had a sister relationship for about 20 years. So other than maybe like a call every once in a while, and sometimes those calls are like a year apart. So I was shocked, I was devastated,"" Flores said of the police rescue. ""We were never allowed to be a part of their lives.""

She explained that she lived with her sister and her family for a few months when she was in college. The Turpins, she said, only had four children at that time and the eldest was in elementary school.

""I thought they were really strict, but I didn't see any type of abuse,"" she said. ""Now that I'm an adult, I look back, I see things that I didn't see then.""

She recalled, however, that she had ""uncomfortable"" experiences with her brother-in-law but she never said anything because she was ""young"" and ""scared.""

""He did things that made me feel uncomfortable,"" Flores said. ""If I were to get in the shower, he would come in there while I was in there and watch me, and it was like a joke. He never touched me or anything.""

Despite the estrangement between her and her sister, she said she was praying for the family.

""I want her to know that she's still my blood and I love her. I don't agree with what she did and her actions have made the whole family suffer. But I want her to know that I'm praying for her salvation and that we do love her,"" said Flores.

166,194,"Pastors Who Lead Double Lives Have Lost Touch With People, Are Wound to the Church, Pope Francis Says","(Photo: REUTERS/Tony Gentile) Pope Francis leads his Wednesday general audience at Paul VI auditorium hall in Vatican City February 8, 2017.

Pope Francis has dismissed out of touch pastors leading double lives as a ""wound"" to the church which parishioners should not emulate.

""It's bad to see pastors with double lives. It's a wound to the Church. Sick pastors, who have lost authority and carry on with this double life. Jesus is stern with them. He not only tells people not to listen to them but also to not do what they do. What does He tell them? 'You're white sepulchers.' Beautiful in doctrine on the outside, but rotting within,"" Francis said in a strongly-worded homily at Casa Santa Marta on Jan. 9.

The pope warned that when pastors begin to lead double lives it is usually a symptom that their prayer life is weak and they have lost touch with the people they are supposed to be serving.

""This is the end of a pastor who is neither close to God in prayer nor close to the people in compassion,"" he said.

In November, Francis highlighted how Jesus warned his disciples about the scribes and Pharisees who ""tie up heavy burdens hard to carry and lay them on people's shoulders, but they will not lift a finger to move them.""

""This attitude is a wicked exercise of authority,"" he said, noting that spiritual leaders should lead by good example, ""helping others practice what is right and due, supporting them in the trials that they encounter on the path of goodness.""

When authority is exercised badly, the pope explained, ""it becomes oppressive, it does not allow people to grow and it creates a climate of distrust and of hostility, and also brings corruption.""

The pope's warning at the time came in light of a report that Indonesian bishop Hubertus Leteng had been accused by dozens of priests in the Diocese of Ruteng of having a mistress and misusing over $120,000 in church funds. He later resigned from his post.

The pontiff urged pastors who have lost their authority to not lose hope like the high priest Eli in the Bible.

Despite the failure of his two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, to live a life of righteousness, Eli still allowed them to serve as priests in the Tabernacle which angered God and the people of Israel.

""I say to the pastors who are detached from God and from the people, 'Don't lose hope. There's always another possibility. It was enough for a man to look and approach a woman, listen to her and awaken the authority to bless and prophecy.

""Accordingly, a son was born to her. Authority. Authority, a gift from God. It only comes from Him. Jesus gives it to His own. Authority in speaking, which comes from closeness to God and to the people. They always go together. Authority is coherence, not double life. It's authority, and if a pastor loses it, he should not lose hope, like Eli. There's always time to come close and reawaken authority and prophecy,"" Francis said.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/pastors-who-lead-double-lives-lost-touch-with-people-are-wound-to-the-church-pope-francis-214281/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
167,195,NFL Star Benjamin Watson Tells Planned Parenthood to Stop Quoting Martin Luther King Jr.,"(Photo: Baltimore Ravens) Baltimore Ravens tight end Benjamin Watson points to the sky during an NFL pre-season game in this undated file photo from 2016.

Baltimore Ravens tight end and pending free agent Benjamin Watson needed just two words to slam the nation's largest abortion provider for quoting the words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., one of the most revered civil rights activists of the 1960s.

On Martin Luther King Day Monday, Planned Parenthood, much like many other organizations in the United States, posted a tribute to the slain minister on its Facebook page.

Planned Parenthood shared a picture of King that features the word ""dream"" in big white lettering. Along with the picture, the abortion chain quoted King as saying: ""Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.""

""Today, we remember Dr King's legacy of resistance and commit to carrying the torch of courageous vision and action towards justice and equity.#MLKDay,"" the Planned Parenthood post reads.

The post by Planned Parenthood, which performs over 300,000 abortions every year and has been accused of unfairly targeting African-American and minority communities, didn't sit well with Watson, a devout Christian who has voiced his pro-life beliefs many times in the past.

Watson shared the Planned Parenthood post on his own Facebook page and offered two words in response: ""Just stop.""

The post comes as Watson gears up to speak to Christians gathered in Washington, D.C., this week for the annual Evangelicals for Life conference, hosted by the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission.

In August 2016, Watson made national headlines after it was reported that he told Turning Point Pregnancy Resource Center in an interview that Planned Parenthood was created to ""exterminate"" African-Americans.

""I do know that blacks kind of represent a large portion of the abortions, and I do know that honestly the whole idea with Planned Parenthood and [founder Margaret] Sanger in the past was to exterminate blacks, and it's kind of ironic that it's working,"" Watson said. ""We [as minorities] support candidates, and overwhelmingly support the idea of having Planned Parenthood and the like, and yet, that is why she created it.""

Watson also seemingly criticized minorities for buying into the abortion agenda.

""We are buying it hook, line, and sinker, like it's a great thing. It's just amazing to me and abortion saddens me, period,"" Watson explained. ""But it seems to be something that is really pushed on minorities and provided to minorities especially as something that they should do. In the public, it seems to be painted that when minorities get pregnant they need to get abortions, especially when it comes to teen pregnancy.""

""It's like when black girls are pregnant, it's like a statistic, but when white girls get pregnant, they get a TV show,"" he added.

Last January, Watson spoke to marchers at the 2017 March for Life. At the event, Watson called on those in attendance to make an impact within their own sphere of influence.

""This is the power of one. It is the power of influence, to influence people in our neighborhoods in our churches, in our workplaces on our teams,"" Watson said. ""It is also the power to unite as we have today as one, for a common cause to end the unthinkable practice of abortion in America.""

The number of Christians living in the Gaza Strip has massively declined, Church leaders have warned, hailing believers who choose to stay behind despite the hardships as being ""real heroes.""

Bishop Oscar Cantu of Las Cruces, New Mexico, told Catholic News Service earlier this week that people in the region are barely ""scrapping by"" because the area has been blockaded by Israel since Hamas, a terrorist group, controls the government.

What is more, only 130 Roman Catholic parishioners remain in Gaza, while not long ago there were 1,700, he said.

""The numbers of Christians in Gaza is dropping precipitously. It is just sad to hear, because obviously there is little to no opportunity for young people. There is little encouragement for them to stay,"" Cantu said.

Several church leaders celebrated mass at Holy Family Parish in Gaza on Sunday, as part of the annual Holy Land Coordination, where bishops from around the world meet with Israeli and Palestinian groups in an effort to promote peace.

Archbishop Stephen Brislin of Cape Town, South Africa, said it is understandable why many people are leaving Gaza, despite reconstruction work that's been ongoing since the 2014 conflict.

""The young people feel they must decide between staying in Gaza or leaving to find schools and jobs in other parts of the world,"" Brislin told CNS.

""This affects the Christian community. The young people who stay in Gaza are the real heroes. They are willing to sacrifice in order to create families and Christian life in Gaza.""

The challenges are massive, however, as young people face nearly 70 percent unemployment in Gaza.

Still, Brislin said it's imperative that the Christian community continues to exist in Gaza, which is known in the Bible as one of the places the Holy Family passed through on their way to Egypt.

""Basically, people are imprisoned. It can feel very claustrophobic ... for young people with a lot of dreams and hopes and potentials. And these potentials are broken because of the lack of opportunities,"" the archbishop warned.

Christians in Gaza have often found themselves caught in the crossfire of the Israeli and Palestinian conflict, and have also faced struggles against the Muslim majority in the area.

Hundreds of believers staged protests in 2012, Reuters reports, and blamed Hamas-affiliated groups of kidnapping members of the Christian community and forcing them to convert to Islam.

Recently, many Muslims and Christians in Gaza came together to protest against U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Al Jazeera, a news outlet controlled by the Qatari government, reported.

""Everyone we have spoken to here is in opposition to the U.S. move, and they say it only adds to the frustration of life here,"" Al Jazeera reported.

Trump's move sparked praise from many Israeli religious leaders, but was met with strong opposition from the Arab world.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/huge-drop-christians-in-gaza-bishop-hails-heroes-staying-behind-build-christian-life-214244/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
169,197,Indonesian Christians Fighting Trump Deportations Likened to Jews Fleeing Nazis by Federal Judge,"(Photo: REUTERS/Brian Snyder) Demonstrators holding an ""Interfaith Prayer Vigil for Immigrant Justice"" talk to ethnic Chinese Christians who fled Indonesia after wide scale rioting decades ago and overstayed their visas in the U.S., following their family meeting, including their five year-old daughter (R), with ICE, in Manchester, New Hampshire, U.S., October 13, 2017.

The plight of around 50 Indonesian Christians living in the U.S. but threatened with deportations by the administration of President Donald Trump has been likened by a federal judge to Jewish people fleeing the Nazis in World War II.

""We're not going to be that country,"" Judge Patti B. Saris said on Wednesday at a hearing in U.S. District Court in Boston.

""We don't want to put them on the ship unless someone"" can review their contention that deportation back to Indonesia is ""a really bad situation for them,"" she added, according to The Boston Globe.

Saris was referencing a case in 1939 when an ocean liner filled with 937 passengers, mostly Jews, left Germany for America, but was turned away by government officials. Hundreds of those Jews were reporedly later killed during the Holocaust.

Saris has ruled in favor of the Christians on a number of occasions against the Trump administration, and in November said that immigration officials do not have the right to carry out immediate deportations.

The believers fear that they will face persecution, torture, and possibly death if they are sent back home to the world's largest Muslim nation.

Most of the Indonesians came to the U.S. in the late 1990s and 2000s, fleeing anti-Christian violence. Although many overstayed their visas, U.S. authorities allowed them to stay based on certain conditions, such as checking in regularly.

They have been caught up in the net of Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration, however, and in August immigration officials told them they only have 30 days to get a plane ticket and depart the country.

Attorneys for the Christians are arguing that their clients deserve the right to at least challenge the deportation orders, and raise their fears of persecution with the Board of Immigration Appeals.

The Justice Department has argued that the Indonesians have not proven that they are likely to face persecution or torture if they are sent back home, however.

""Their assertion that 'all face a significant risk of persecution and torture if removed to Indonesia' is unsupported by facts that relate to any specific petitioner,"" DOJ lawyers have said.

Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, who brokered the deal in 2009 that allowed the Christians to stay in seacoast communities in New Hampshire, has insisted that they do face significant religious persecution back home.

""Deporting these individuals will needlessly split families and communities, and put lives in danger. I'll continue to make every effort to prevent these deportations so that the Indonesian community can continue to live peacefully in New Hampshire,"" Shaheen said last year.

Meldy Lumangkun, one Indonesian Christian, told ICE officials in Manchester that there is also concern for the children.

""We are afraid to go home. We fear for the safety of our children,"" Lumangkun explained. ""Here our children can live safely.""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/indonesian-christians-fighting-trump-deportations-likened-to-jews-fleeing-nazis-by-federal-judge-214398/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

More than a week after Instagram deleted a post from megachurch Pastor Jamal Bryant for not ""promoting harmony"" because he urged a boycott of Swedish clothing retail giant H&M over racist advertising, an official from Facebook, which owns the application, said it was a ""mistake.""

""We mistakenly removed the content and worked to rectify the mistake as soon as we were notified,"" an Instagram spokesperson told The Christian Post in a statement late Thursday.

The Empowerment Temple church leader and social activist revealed in a video he posted on his Facebook page on Jan. 8 that he took umbrage to H&M's use of a black boy to model a sweatshirt with the slogan ""Coolest monkey in the jungle"" that was featured on the company's U.K. website and decided to join in a growing protest against the company for their insensitivity.

""I immediately at 6 o'clock this morning (Jan. 8) en route to the gym, posted on Instagram. That every person who is of conscience no matter what your color, should in fact be boycotting H&M because they do not appreciate our dollars and don't understand our depth and don't think highly enough of us to put us on their board of directors. #boycottH&M,"" Bryant said in the video.

Facebook also never had an African-American on its board until it announced Thursday that it will bring Kenneth Chenault, the CEO of American Express, onto its board.

After about 4,000 people had approved his message on the social platform, Bryant said Instagram sent him a note saying: ""We have taken the liberty to delete your post because it does not promote harmony.""

A more diplomatic version of Bryant's controversial post is currently live on his Instagram page.

Many high profile public figures such as NBA star LeBron James and rapper Diddy have voiced their disapproval of the H&M advertisement. Singer Abel Makkonen Tesfaye, popularly known as ""the Weeknd,"" has canceled his partnership with the company.

There has been intense global backlash over the advertising. At least two H&M outlets in South Africa were trashed by the opposition Economic Freedom Fighters party during anti-racism protests that forced the company to close all of its stores in that country on Saturday.

A Fortune report said the company announced Annie Wu as their new global leader for diversity and inclusiveness on Tuesday. She was already the global manager for employee relations.

""The recent incident was entirely unintentional, but it demonstrates so clearly how big our responsibility is as a global brand,"" H&M said in a message on Instagram. ""Our commitment to addressing diversity and inclusiveness is genuine, therefore we have appointed a global leader, in this area, to drive our work forward.""

Bryant charged, however, that despite the company's apology, it has no real commitment to diversity and inclusion.

""Don't walk away from H&M just for today. Shut the door,"" he told his supporters. ""Save your apology H&M. The reason why it is that you are able to do it with clear conscience is that you are developing, you are manufacturing, you are warehousing, you are shipping all at the hands of black people but on your board of 12, you have not one minority sitting on your board.""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/instagram-mistakenly-deleted-pastor-jamal-bryants-post-urging-hm-boycott-company-says-214423/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

405,471,"NSA Has Been Running a Voice-Recognition System Since 2004, Says Report","REUTERS/Pawel Kopczynski An illustration picture shows the logo of the U.S. National Security Agency on the display of an iPhone in Berlin, June 7, 2013.

The National Security Agency has reportedly been using a voice-recognition system since 2004.

Siri is one of the earliest digital personal assistants available to consumers, but it was only released in 2011. Then came Amazon's Alexa in 2014 and Google Assistant in 2016. These programs are designed to take commands by accurately recognizing the voice of the device owner.

However, an exclusive report from The Intercept recently revealed that it was the NSA which had actually developed a seemingly effective voice-recognition system dating back to 2004. The report cited a classified NSA memo dated 2006 that listed the accomplishments of the agency's voice-identification system and provided some details on how it worked.

Like many technological developments, NSA's reported voice-recognition system started with human work. According to the 2006 document, transcribers working on SIGINT (gathering intelligence by intercepting signals) were later able to identify subjects through ""his voice and by his unique way of speaking.""

Later, by applying mathematical formulas and algorithms, the process has reportedly performed ""surprisingly more robust and consistent than humans.""

The Intercept added that while NSA had been using fingerprints and facial recognition methods to track down their targets, the agency also saw a number of successes with voiceprints - a collection of speech-related information that noted that every individual has distinct voice characteristics due to specific qualities such as the ""shape of the mouth"" and the ""length of the larynx.""

The same report took note of pieces of information previously revealed by Edward Snowden that claimed the NSA had tools match a target's voice through an alleged database of intercepted voice and video calls even if they were using foreign languages, secret codes or phone numbers.

Meanwhile, it is unknown whether the reported NSA voice-recognition tool has had an actual effect on consumers, especially now that voice-activated digital assistants have become a staple in newer smartphone models.

However, it is important to note that programs like Alexa and Siri effectively work through the storage of vital biometric information from their users. It can be recalled that last year, Apple did reveal that governments had made requests to collect customer data for various reasons including cases of fraud and the suspected illegal use of their products and services. As the company claimed, these requests require search warrants but reports noted that these types of letters from governments often come with a gag order.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/nsa-has-been-running-a-voice-recognition-system-since-2004-says-report-214949/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
446,515,Mike Pence Takes Heat for Trump's Jerusalem Decision on Middle East Tour,"(PHOTO: REUTERS/MARY F. CALVERT) U. S. Vice President Mike Pence addresses Chamber of Commerce ''Invest in America!'' summit in Washington U.S., on May 18, 2017.

U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, who is on a four-day trip to the Middle East, met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi in Egypt and King Abdullah II in Jordan, and saw anger in the region over President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Pence assured allies of U.S. support for two-state solution if both sides agree.

In his meeting with the Egyptian president Saturday, which lasted for about two and a half hours, Pence was told Trump's decision can potentially complicate negotiations over a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians, according to The Wall Street Journal.

At a press conference later, Pence called it ""a disagreement between friends,"" according to the Los Angeles Times. He added that he assured Sisi that the Trump administration will back a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians if both parties agree. ""My perception was that he was encouraged by that message,"" he told reporters.

The two leaders also discussed how to deal with Americans imprisoned by Egypt and also about terrorism and North Korea's nuclear program.

However, U.S. reporters and a Pence aide were initially not allowed to leave their van at the presidential palace in Cairo, according to the Journal. With the help of colleagues outside, Pence's aide was finally able to enter the palace. And only after Pence raised the issue directly with Sisi did the Egyptians later allow the press to take pictures and listen to brief remarks.

In Jordan, Pence and King Abdullah ""emphasized the strength of the strategic Jordanian U.S. relationship as well the role the U.S. plays in ensuring regional stability,"" according to the Jordanian embassy in Washington, D.C.

""They also discussed efforts to end the Syrian crisis as well as the importance of international cooperation in efforts to bring a political solution to this crisis. Both sides also discussed efforts to revive the Palestinian Israeli peace process and means to bring both sides back to the negotiation table,"" the embassy said in a statement.

Abdullah had warned against declaring Jerusalem Israel's capital.

Pence's Middle East trip will end in Israel, where he will meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and address the Israeli legislature as well as visit the Western Wall.

Pence will not meet Palestinian leaders.

The office of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas had also said he would not meet with Pence during his visit to the West Bank ""because the U.S. has crossed red lines"" on Jerusalem.

Trump announced last month that the U.S. will be beginning a process to move its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and officially recognize the city as Israel's capital. ""While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver. Today, I am delivering,"" he said at the time.

The status of Jerusalem has been up for dispute for centuries, with the Romans, Crusaders, Ottomans and the British Empire among the factions fighting historical battles for control over the city.

Jerusalem contains numerous sacred sites claimed by Christians, Jews, and Muslims, and is where Jesus Christ preached, died, and was later resurrected.

British rule over the area ended in 1948, which led to Jordan's invasion and occupation of the Old City, before Israel captured the land in the 1967 Middle East war. In 1980 Israel declared Jerusalem to be a ""complete and united"" city and capital of its country, to the protest of Arab countries in the region.

Palestinians, on the other hand, see East Jerusalem as their capital. They live in the city as Israeli residents, receive access to services and vote in municipal elections. Some become Israeli citizens and can vote in parliamentary elections, but most refuse to do so.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/mike-pence-trump-jerusalem-decision-middle-east-tour-214540/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

TobyMac is gearing up for a marathon that aims to help end racial division, class segregation and spiritual poverty.

TobyMac, the genre-blending Christian contemporary music artist, is participating in the marathon called the St. Jude Rock 'N' Roll Nashville Marathon. The half marathon or 5K taking place in Nashville was created to raise money for various charities.

The musician is partnering with a group called Run for Hope to raise money that can help transform the community of Franklin, Tennessee.

""Run For Hope is a group of New Hope Academy supporters running in the St. Jude Rock 'N' Roll Nashville Marathon, half marathon or 5K.

The New Hope Academy says it is on a mission to set people free by helping people form relationships across race, culture and class.

""Black, white, rich, or poor, we are limited by our prejudices, our fears, and our lack of resources. And we all have them,"" the website states. ""New Hope provides a radical opportunity for relationships to form across racial, economic, and cultural lines within the community — thereby assisting the poor, bringing people together, and cultivating racial reconciliation.""

Aside from TobyMac, worship musician Ryan Stevenson said he would participate in the event that takes place in April.

448,517,Christian Actor Kevin Sorbo Responds to Being 'Banned' by Comic Convention,"(Photo: TMZ/Screengrab) Kevin Sorbo speaks with TMZ at LAX airport in a video posted on April 12, 2017.

Christian actor Kevin Sorbo made headlines last week for allegedly being ""banned"" from a comic convention. Now the actor is speaking out, claiming that he found the entire situation amusing since he was never intending to attend the event in the first place.

The convention promoter and comic book artist Cliff Galbraith bragged on Facebook post last week that Sorbo, who is known for his role as Hercules in the 1995-1999 TV show ""Hercules: The Legendary Journeys,"" would be refused entrance to his upcoming event in April because of his conservative affiliations.

""I turned down Kevin Sorbo for East Coast Comicon. He's pals with Sean Hannity. I just can't do it,"" the promoter wrote.

However, in an interview with LifeZette on Wednesday Sorbo set the record straight.

""I thought this [the Facebook post] was pretty funny. I laughed,"" the ""Andromeda"" star said about the topic.

Sorbo said being discriminated on because of his conservative or political beliefs by a fan convention ""is a first"" for him.

""To me, it's like, what a smart move. I was never even invited [to the convention]. My agent never went there. I went online and it's a very small con [event], so he [Gailbraith] was trying to drum up interest in his con and himself. I appreciate it and I applaud his entrepreneurial spirit, especially for a guy who is a socialist,"" the 59-year-old actor continued.

The actor maintained that he was not at all surprised to see a ""liberal person"" judge him based solely on his conservative views.

""The Left is so angry about the election still, over a year later,"" Sorbo concluded.

Many of Galbraith's liberal supporters on Facebook praised him for making the decision to exclude Sorbo, and one user even went as far as noting that Sorbo had been listed on IMDB's list of ""racist or right-wing stars to avoid.""

Nevertheless, the negative responses or press is not phasing the ""God's Not Dead"" actor and he concluded that he would, in fact, work with Fox News talk show host Sean Hannity again in the future.

Sorbo and the political commentator released a faith-based film together titled, ""Let There Be Light"" at the end of 2017. The film had the second highest per screen average of all wide releases in 2017 and grossed an impressive $7,203,808 at the box office.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/christian-actor-kevin-sorbo-responds-being-banned-comic-convention-214537/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
449,518,Franklin Graham Responds to Trump-Porn Star Allegations: 'He Is Not President Perfect',"(Screengrab: YouTube / ABC15 Arizona) Evangelist Franklin Graham speaks at President Donald Trump's rally in Phoenix, Arizona on August 22, 2017.

Questioned by MSNBC about a recent accusation that a lawyer for Donald Trump had paid $130,000 to a porn star to keep quiet about an alleged affair during the election season, evangelist Franklin Graham said Trump ""is not president perfect"" and added that ""we just have to give the man the benefit of the doubt.""

""Does the president have a sin problem?"" MSNBC ""Live"" anchor Alex Witt asked, referring to the porn star, Stormy Daniels.

""He is not president perfect,"" Graham, the president and CEO of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, told Witt. ""President Trump I don't think has admitted to having an affair with this person. And so this is just a news story, and I don't even know if it's accurate.""

Graham added that he believes ""at 70 years of age, the president is a much different person today than he was four years ago, five years ago, 10 years ago, or whatever and we just have to give the man the benefit of the doubt.""

Trump said he didn't do it, ""so okay, let's say he didn't do it,"" Graham added.

Asked about his support for a president who was recently accused of referring to Haiti, El Salvador and African nations as ""s***hole countries,"" Graham said he doesn't think it's hypocritical.

""He said he didn't say it, so I have to go along with the president in that he didn't say it,"" Graham added.

""Why are we having all these people from s---hole countries come here?"" Trump allegedly asked during a recent meeting at the Oval Office in the White House with several Republicans and Democrats during immigration negotiations, according to The Washington Post, which also reported that the president said he would prefer people from countries like Norway to come to America instead.

""God has forgiven me and I've asked for his forgiveness, and I think the president has, too,"" Graham said. ""We certainly don't hold him up as the pastor of this nation and he is not. But I appreciate the fact that the president does have a concern for Christian values, he does have a concern to protect Christians whether its here at home or around the world and I appreciate the fact that he protects religious liberty and freedom.""

The Islamic State terror group, also known as IS, ISIS, ISIL or Daesh, recently lost its territorial empire in Iraq and Syria due to a U.S.-led military campaign.

Graham stressed that Trump is ""a businessman who is a president, not a politician, but a businessman.""

He continued, ""We should all be grateful that he's brought his knowledge to Washington and he's helping to turn this economy around.""

The president's deregulation and tax cut policies have resulted in the stock markets hitting record highs with the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumping past 25,000 for the first time ever earlier this month, among other economic indicators.

Earlier this month, The Wall Street Journal reported that a lawyer for Trump had paid $130,000 in hush money to Stormy Daniels.

Daniels, whose given name is Stephanie Clifford, has claimed to multiple publications that she had sex with Trump around the time that his wife Melania had given birth to their son Barron. According to the story, Daniels and Trump began their affair in July 2006 at American Century celebrity golf tournament in which Trump invited the porn star into his room and they had what she later described as ""textbook generic"" sex.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/franklin-graham-trump-porn-star-allegations-not-president-perfect-214549/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
450,519,"To Build Pro-Life Culture, Christians Must Address Culture of 'Self': Evangelical","(Photo: Rocket Republic, Courtesy of ERLC) Russell Moore addresses Evangelicals for Life conference at the JW Marriott Hotel on January 18, 2018.

WASHINGTON — Building a culture that values life will be a ""100-year project"" that requires Christians to address our ""protection of self"" society, said prominent evangelical Russell Moore.

And promoting that culture of life means equally valuing the unborn as well as the elderly, immigrants and refugees, the poor, the vulnerable, and women, he stressed while speaking at Evangelicals for Life 2018.

Before hundreds assembled Thursday at the J.W. Marriott Hotel in downtown Washington, several speakers stressed the importance for Christians to articulate a value for life at every stage. Particular emphasis was given to the unborn as conference attendees participated in the March for Life Friday, the largest annual pro-life gathering in the nation. The conference was sponsored by Focus on the Family and the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, the policy arm of the Southern Baptist Convention.

""The overturning of Roe v. Wade is necessary for justice but the overturning of Roe v. Wade does not by itself constitute justice,"" said Moore, president of the ERLC in an interview with The Christian Post.

Overturning the contentious 1973 case that legalized abortion nationwide would simply send the matter back to the states and culture, he pointed out.

""But we also have to be working at dealing with the root of the problem as well. It's a both/and not an either/or,"" he said, mentioning a feminist leader and abortion rights advocate whose words haunt him; this feminist leader once said that ""most Americans are pro-life with three exceptions: rape, incest, and my situation.""

""When one looks around and sees the culture in American life of the self and of protection of self it inevitably leads to an abortion culture. We have to address that as well,"" Moore said, adding that ""this is not a four- or five-year project. This is going to have to be a 100-year project.""

Moore, who during the 2016 election was a vocal critic of then candidate Donald Trump, has since praised the president's moves toward protecting the unborn while urging the administration to take a different approach toward immigrants and refugees.

""I think there's a sense in which sometimes it is difficult to say political allies on one issue does not mean that a person is adopting completely everything that the movement articulates,"" Moore said when asked about Trump's favorable moves toward protecting the unborn but unfavorable rhetoric and posture toward refugees and immigrants.

""Politics is important but politics is not ultimate, and so we are not afraid of it but we don't idolize it either — that everything is not utopia or dystopia at any given moment.""

In his remarks at the conference, the ERLC president noted that a culture that values life cannot simultaneously value hedonism and pornography. The pro-life witness will never flourish where women are not valued, he said.

""There was a time when churches were reluctant to talk about healthy sexuality but that has changed but not in ways that are altogether good,"" Moore told CP.

""I will often see Song of Solomon preached sort of as a how-to guide to better sex rather than getting at the deeper fabric of what human sexuality is. I also think we have to have moral credibility on issues of sexuality. If God has revealed something to us about sexuality, and He has, we have to speak consistently both about sin and about the offer of grace.""

Churches cannot do this while ignoring the ravages of the divorce culture and refusing to speak to the issues of abuse, he continued to explain, a topic that has been accentuated as credible allegations of sexual misconduct by top leaders in many industries have surfaced in recent months.

Moore further recalled that he was once debating abortion with a pro-choice advocate who said, ""Well, if you all care about unborn children, why don't you adopt some children.""

""And I said, 'I have so have many people that I know.' And the response was almost immediately 'Isn't it terrible that you religious people are adopting children and inculcating them into your worldview.'""

""The idea, as [former Congressman] Barney Frank said years ago, 'pro-lifers begin at conception and ends at birth,' is not true. And at the local level in many ways the pro-life movement has demonstrated that better than anyone,"" Moore said.

The Evangelicals for Life conference also showcased the continuing growth and work of pro-life crisis pregnancy centers.

""When I look at the sorts of ministries, too numerous to even count, that are helping vulnerable women, I can think of countless ministries that deal with the full range of the human experience where they're not simply talking about abortion decision itself, but getting at the root of what's going on in that woman's life and loving her,"" Moore said.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/to-build-pro-life-culture-christians-must-address-culture-of-self-evangelical-214559/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

President Donald Trump has issued a proclamation declaring Jan. 22, which is the anniversary of the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade, ""National Sanctity of Human Life Day.""

In an official statement released last Friday, President Trump explained in the proclamation that the observance is meant to ""affirm the truth that all life is sacred, that every person has inherent dignity and worth, and that no class of people should ever be discarded as 'non-human.'""

""Reverence for every human life, one of the values for which our Founding Fathers fought, defines the character of our Nation. Today, it moves us to promote the health of pregnant mothers and their unborn children,"" read the proclamation.

""It animates our concern for single moms; the elderly, the infirm, and the disabled; and orphan and foster children. It compels us to address the opioid epidemic and to bring aid to those who struggle with mental illness. It gives us the courage to stand up for the weak and the powerless.""

The proclamation also noted that scientific research ""continues to support and build the case for"" the pro-life movement and their agenda items.

""Medical technologies allow us to see images of the unborn children moving their newly formed fingers and toes, yawning, and even smiling,"" continued the proclamation.

""Those images present us with irrefutable evidence that babies are growing within their mothers' wombs — precious, unique lives, each deserving a future filled with promise and hope. We can also now operate on babies in utero to stave off life-threatening diseases.""

452,521,Church of England Advises Clergy to Use Baptism Rite to Celebrate Gender Transition,"(Photo: REUTERS/Hannah McKay) A priest wears a rainbow ribbon during a vigil against Anglican Homophobia, outside the General Synod of the Church of England in London, Britain, February 15, 2017.

The Church of England's House of Bishops has decided against creating a new service to celebrate a person's gender transition. The bishops are advising that the church mark the transgender occasion instead with the existing baptism rite.

The Archbishop of York, John Sentamu, was one of the senior church officials who had called for a new baptism-style service specifically created for transgender Christians. But in a private meeting at Lambeth Palace the bishops rejected the move, The Mail reported on Sunday.

The Rev. Chris Newlands said that it would be a ""wonderful opportunity to create a liturgy which speaks powerfully to the particularities of trans people, and make a significant contribution to their well-being and support.""

Though the church will not be creating a new rite to mark a person's gender transition, clergy are being advised to use the existing rite, Affirmation of Baptismal Faith, which was designed to celebrate the baptism or confirmation of a person.

""The Church of England welcomes transgender people and wholeheartedly wishes for them to be included in the life of the Church,"" the Rt. Rev. Graham James, Bishop of Norwich, said in a statement.

""On the matter of whether a new service is needed, the House of Bishops has decided that the current service that is used to affirm baptism can be adapted.

""Clergy always have the discretion to compose and say prayers with people as they see fit.""

The General Synod officially passed a motion last July that welcomed and affirmed transgender people to the church, with the vote going overwhelmingly in favor of the change.

The House of Bishops was left to decide on whether special liturgical materials would be prepared to mark a person's gender transition in a baptism-style ceremony.

CofE bishops are reportedly also working on a major ""teaching document,"" which will not be ready before 2020, on the long-standing debate over same-sex marriage.

The church defines marriage as a union solely between one man and one woman, though it has faced criticism from both liberal and conservative wings.

Conservative Anglicans, such as the Global Anglican Future Conference, have accused church leadership of giving in to pressure to ""compromise clear Christian teaching in the face of secular humanist philosophy.""

The Church of England also raised eyebrows in November with its ""Valuing All God's Children"" report, which said that allowing children to cross-dress could be one way to tackle homophobia and transphobia at school.

465,535,Homeschoolers Concerned About More Regulations After Alleged Abuse at Perris House,"(Photo: Facebook) David Allen Turpin, 57, and his wife Louise Anna Turpin,49, are pictured here with their 13 children.

Homeschooling advocates are concerned about additional regulations after news of abuse from homeschooling parents in California.

The Massachusetts-based Coalition for Responsible Home Education, a nonprofit group that is actively advocating for homeschooling reform, says a lack of oversight for homeschools allows abuse, such at the recent case in Perris, California, to go unchecked and is now calling for increased regulation of homeschools.

Pentecostal Christian couple David Allen Turpin, 57, and his 49-year-old wife, Louise Anna Turpin, were arrested on Jan. 14, after police had to rescue their 13 severely malnourished children from their home in Perris, California. The home was registered as a homeschool.

""The lack of oversight of home schools is what allows people to hide abuse,"" Kathryn Brightbill, legislative policy analyst for the coalition told The Press-Enterprise. ""We believe that the various states should introduce legislation to have annual contact with mandated reporters.""

And a statement from the Board of Directors of the HomeSchool Association of California said they anticipate new legislation is on the horizon.

""We know that many homeschooling families are feeling nervous due to the recent abuse case which has been in the news,"" the directors said. ""We do suspect legislation may be forthcoming that might try to regulate private homeschoolers. We do not know what form that proposed legislation will take and it is a complicated endeavor that is likely to take some time. We assure you that HSC will have a hand in fighting or helping to define any bills that are proposed.""

In an earlier statement, Debbie Schwarzer, the organization's legal team co-chair dismissed the idea of an annual inspection requirement for homeschooled children.

""I've seen articles that suggest that private homeschoolers should be required to present their children for an annual inspection by teachers and a doctor. It's an outrageous suggestion, one that amounts to suspecting all homeschooling parents of being unfit, of being capable of crimes against their children,"" Schwarzer wrote.

""Obviously the overwhelming majority of parents who choose to homeschool their children do so with the best interests of their children as their top priority. They should not be subjected to suspicion by the state and gross invasion of their privacy through unwarranted intrusion into their lives. The state and society should give them the same benefit of the doubt that all parents are given, of acting in their children's best interests until specific facts or circumstances suggest otherwise,"" she added.

Data cited by the Coalition for Responsible Home Education argues there is very little accountability for homeschooling parents across the nation.

Some 11 states do not require parents to provide notice of homeschooling, 14 states do not require parents to provide instruction in any specific subject, 25 states do not require any form of academic assessments, parents in 39 states are not required to have a high school diploma, GED, or other qualifications and 48 states have no protections for at-risk homeschooled children.

""The current lack of accountability or oversight of homeschooling has negative consequences for thousands of homeschooled children. In some cases homeschooling serves to hide abuse, and in other cases parents shortchange their children educationally,"" the organization said.

According to the U.S. Department of Education, there were an estimated 1.8 million homeschooled students in the United States in 2012. This number showed an increase from 850,000 in 1999, when estimates were first reported.

California law requires all children between 6 and 18 to be enrolled in public school unless their parents opt to make them attend a ""full-time, private day school"" or learn from a private tutor with a valid California teaching certificate, according to The Press Enterprise.

Anyone who homeschools at least six students, like the Turpin family must file to form their own ""private school."" The Turpins registered their home as a private school named Sandcastle Day School whose only students were their children.

Authorities who rescued the Christian couple's children said they had very little knowledge of the outside world and were poorly homeschooled.

Last Thursday, David and Louise Turpin were charged with 12 criminal counts of torture, seven counts of abuse of a dependent adult, and 12 counts of false imprisonment that could keep them behind bars for life if they are convicted. David Turpin also faces one count of committing a lewd act by force or fear. He and his wife have both pleaded not guilty and are now being held on bail of $13 million each.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/homeschool-concerned-more-regulations-abuse-perris-house-california-214688/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
517,594,Hindus Burn Down Church in India Alleging 'Forced Conversion',"Expand | Collapse (Photo: BACA) A Hindu mob burned a church and Christian-owned businesses at Jammu and Kashmir, India, January 2018.

A mob led by apparent Hindu nationalists burned down a church and shops belonging to Christians in India's northern state of Jammu and Kashmir after the death of a woman, whom the mob believed was forcibly converted to Christianity.

A large group of Hindus resorted to violence last week in the Rajouri district bordering Pakistan after a local man, Rinku Kumar, brought the body of his 25-year-old wife, Seema Devi, for a Christian burial, according to UCAN News.

Devi's family falsely claimed that their daughter was forced to convert to Christianity by her husband and was murdered by him. According to the British Asian Christian Association, one of Devi's uncles told a local newspaper that ""she could not have willingly quit her Hindu faith.""

But BACA reported that Devi had become a Christian over two years ago, years after her husband converted to Christianity. She became sick just days after their marriage but was healed during a church service, BACA said. Two years later, however, the illness returned and she died on Jan. 15.

When Kumar brought her body from Punjab state to Jammu and Kashmir to be buried, news of the burial spread and incited violence.

Hindu fanatics from extremist group Bajran Dal and a mob of over 300 people sought revenge the next day by smashing Sehal Christ Church and setting it on fire. Christians attending the church for prayer were beaten, with 12 seriously injured. Businesses that were owned by Christians were also damaged.

Moreover, the mob exhumed the body of Devi and burned it, as part of a Hindu ritual, BACA reported.

Devi's uncle, Joginder Singh, told UCANews that they were not aware Devi's husband was a Christian and that they found out about it last month ""when she told us over the phone that her husband took her to Christmas prayers at a church in Punjab. He must have coerced her to convert to Christianity.""

Kumar was severely beaten and arrested, along with seven other Christians, by local police. None of the Hindus involved in the mob violence were arrested.

William Masih, a local Christian, told BACA that during the violence, local police just stood by and watched and that Christians, who are already marginalized, have become more fearful.

State lawmaker Sheikh Abdul Rasheed has called for the arrest of the people who burned down Christian property, and decried the persecution of minorities across the country.

According to BACA, the pastor of the church that was burned down has gone into hiding and Christians from that church are being forcibly reconverted back to Hinduism.

Wilson Chowdhry, chairman of the British Asian Christian Association, said in a statement, ""This attack on innocent Christians highlights the increasing hatred towards non-Hindus in an India that has become increasingly polarized under the Narendra Modi regime.

""Attacks on Christians are increasing with intensity and frequency and rarely result in convictions for the perpetrators.""

While few incidents of Christian persecution are reported from the state of Jammu and Kashmir, the incidence of attacks on Christians is alarmingly high in several other parts of the country. False allegations on Christians are also common across the country.

Christian persecution has steeply risen since the Hindu rightwing Bharatiya Janata Party won the general election in 2014.

The first quarter of 2017 saw 248 incidents of persecution, and by the end of June, the number grew to 410, compared to a total of 441 incidents reported in all of 2016, a recent report by Open Doors revealed.

""When the Christians are beaten by the extremists, they receive injuries mostly on their heads or their vital body parts,"" a local partner of Open Doors said in the report. ""The assaulters do not care if the person dies in the attack. They know that they will not be punished because the government (and hence the judiciary) will take their side. In most of the cases the assaulters go unpunished.""

The governing party in India is connected with a Hindu nationalist organization, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, whose founder, M.S. Golwalkar, has said: ""The non-Hindu people in Hindustan (referring to India) must either adopt the Hindu culture and language, must learn to respect and revere Hindu religion, must entertain no idea but the glorification of the Hindu religion, that is they must not only give up their attitude of intolerance and ingratitude toward this land and its age-long tradition but must also cultivate the positive attitude of love and devotion instead; in one word they must cease to be foreigners or may stay in the country wholly subordinated to the Hindu nation claiming nothing, deserving no privileges, far less any preferential treatment not even citizen's rights.""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/hindus-burn-down-church-in-india-alleging-forced-conversion-214611/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
518,595,"Don't Let Political Identity Trump Your Identity in Christ, World Vision President Says","(Photo: Rocket Republic, Courtesy of ERLC) Richard Stearns, president of World Vision, addresses the Evangelicals for Life conference at JW Marriott in Washington, D.C. on January 19, 2018.

WASHINGTON — The president of a Christian humanitarian relief organizations is urging Christians embrace a pro-life ethic that includes refugees, the elderly, and immigrants in addition to the unborn. And followers of Jesus must be especially watchful that American national identity does not trump their identity in Christ, he says.

At Evangelicals for Life 2018 held at the JW Marriott hotel last week, World Vision President Richard Stearns sat down with The Christian Post for an interview about the importance of valuing life at every stage, a recurring theme throughout the two-day conference that coincided with the March for Life, the largest annual pro-life gathering in the nation.

""Some of the same people that value the unborn as precious lives don't want refugees to seek asylum in our country or may want to build a wall to keep out immigrants that might come across illegally,"" Stearns lamented.

People tend to put different price tags on different lives and all of us tend to look at the world with our own filters and lenses and values systems, he continued. And although the phrase ""consistently pro-life"" has become cliché ""you can't just value the unborn, you have to value the elderly, you have to value the immigrant, you have to value the disabled, you have to value people you don't agree with, people of other religions,"" he said.

""The most powerful witness Christians have for the truth of the Gospel is unconditional love, especially for the least of these, the widow, the orphan, the stranger.""

When Christians love the unlovable unconditionally and sacrificially, ""the world steps back and takes notice and says 'Wow, who are these people? How do we explain their unconditional love? They are doing things that we would never expect them to do and they value life.'""

Stearns further expressed concern the current political climate, urging Christians to resist the temptation to pledge unquestioning allegiance to a particular party or movement.

""Here's what I think is happening in our culture, our identity as Americans, our national identity, is trumping our religious identity,"" he said. ""But our identity in Christ should be at the very, very top of our value system and it should inform everything else.""

""God does not put a price tag on Americans and say they are worth more than Syrians. We're the ones that are doing that. We are the ones that are playing with the price tags. And I think we have mixed up our national identity and our politics with our faith to a point where some can no longer tell the difference between all of those domains in their life.""

The World Vision president noted that lately he has taken to saying that far too often people, whether their views lean to the right or left, spend too much time considering what is politically correct when they ought to be concerned about being biblically correct.

""If we're biblically correct about refugees we would see God loves those refugees. These are people in desperate situations, that have lost loved ones, have fled their homes, that have nothing. These are the people Jesus talked about when He spoke 'For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink,"" Stearns said, citing Matthew 25:35.

""We should have no other response but to say, 'How can we help these people?'""

While it is important for Christians to be politically engaged, whenever the Church gets consumed with politics it sullies the Church, not the politicians, Stearns said.

Earlier this month it was announced that Stearns will be retiring, having been the longest serving leader at World Vision in the organization's history. CP asked him what he is most proud of and heartened by during his tenure.

""Most of our constituents, our child sponsors, are surprised to hear that in the last 25 years more people have been lifted out of extreme poverty than at any time in history,"" he recounted.

An estimated 2.8 billion lacked access to clean water in 1990 and today it's less than 700 million, he noted. Likewise, maternal mortality in childbirth has been halved, world hunger has been reduced, adult literacy has climbed substantially.

""The world is changing in profound ways for the better and almost every indicator of poverty is going in the right direction.""

And these encouraging developments in the past few decades are bigger than putting a man on the moon and ought to be celebrated much more, he said.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/dont-let-political-identity-trump-your-identity-in-christ-world-vision-president-says-214689/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
519,596,Christian Filmmakers Ask Appeals Court to Stop Minnesota From Forcing Them to Film Gay Weddings,"(Screenshot: YouTube/Alliance Defending Freedom) Carl and Angel Larsen, the couple who owns the Minnesota-based Telescope Media Group. In Dec. 2016, the Larsens filed suit against a state law that would compel them to film same-sex wedding ceremonies despite their religious objections.

A Christian couple who were told by Minnesota officials that they must film same-sex weddings despite their religious objections have appealed to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.

Carl and Angel Larsen of Telescope Media Group appealed a lower court decision from last year which said they had to film same-sex weddings or face legal penalties.

Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative law firm representing the Larsens, filed an opening brief last Friday arguing that Minnesota law violates the couple's constitutional rights.

""The Larsens serve all people. They just cannot convey all messages. Because of their religious beliefs, they cannot celebrate any vision of marriage other than one between one man and one woman,"" read the brief.

Expand | Collapse

""At the same time, the Larsens' faith requires them to use their talents to express messages that honor God. They want to do this by producing wedding films, publishing them online, and posting a statement explaining their religious views. But these plans are on hold because Minnesota will punish them if they post their statement or create wedding films consistent with their faith while declining to create wedding films promoting contrary views.""

ADF Senior Counsel Jeremy Tedesco said in a statement released Monday that the state ""shouldn't threaten artists with fines and jail simply for living in accordance with their beliefs in the artistic marketplace.""

""Americans should have the freedom to disagree on significant matters of conscience, which is why everyone, regardless of their view of marriage, should support the Larsens,"" added Tedesco.

""Government is supposed to be freedom's greatest protector, not its greatest threat. That's why we are asking the 8th Circuit to reverse the district court's decision.""

In December 2016, the Larsens filed suit against the Minnesota Human Rights Act's ban on sexual orientation discrimination, stating that the measure would force them to film same-sex weddings.

U.S. District Court Judge John Tunheim ruled against the Larsens last September, arguing, among other things, that the law is ""neutral"" in its application and does not force businesses to convey a government message.

Judge Tunheim also concluded that while the law ""does incidentally require wedding videographers to make videos they might not want to make,"" these concerns are ""immaterial.""

""First, speech-for-hire is commonly understood to reflect the views of the customer,"" wrote Tunheim. ""Thus, when a person views a wedding video, there is little danger that they would naturally attribute the video's messages to the videographer.""

""Second, the Larsens can easily disclaim personal sponsorship of the messages depicted in the wedding videos they create for clients. For example, the Larsens could post language on their website stating that while they follow applicable law, and thus serve couples regardless of protected status, they are opposed to same-sex marriage.""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/christian-filmmakers-ask-appeals-court-to-stop-minnesota-from-forcing-them-to-film-gay-weddings-214833/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
520,597,"Former Church for Life Pastor Taught Young Women to Masturbate, Orgasm in Pre-Marriage Classes, Suit Says","(Photo: Facebook) Robert and Cindy Litzinger.

A mother of two has filed a lawsuit against former Church for Life pastor Robert Litzinger and his wife Cindy, alleging sexual battery, assault and harassment stemming from a slew of incidents, including teaching young women how to masturbate and orgasm in preparation for their husbands in pre-marriage classes.

Robert Litzinger, explains the Santa Maria Times, stepped down from the helm of the California church in June 2016 after complaints were made to church personnel about opinions he allegedly shared on viewing pornography in one of his pre-marital classes.

The lawsuit filed by a Jane Doe in her 30s alleges that Litzinger's wife, Cindy, knowingly co-conspired in the misconduct from 2014-16. Shortly after Litzinger stepped down, the mother learned that she was not the only victim of the unwanted advances and more than a dozen women had similar stories to share.

Doe charged in the lawsuit that Litzinger exploited his position as lead pastor to ""cultivate an atmosphere within Church for Life, through which he could satisfy his sexual fetishes.""

In pre-marital classes, she alleged that the pastor would try and ""prepare the young women for their husbands and their wedding night,"" advising the women on how to masturbate, have an orgasm and explore their bodies, in order to be ""prepared and willing to do whatever their husbands wanted.""

He would also share photos with Doe of himself and Cindy, covered in bed, with a note saying ""just had a great session"" and urged her to be similarly open with him about her sex life. He reportedly badgered her until she complied with his request.

Litzinger and his wife appear very open about their love for each other in a video posted to YouTube.

""My wife, my lover and we get to sleep together and all that kind of stuff,"" the ex-pastor says as he introduces his wife at a church event.

""Thanks babe,"" Cindy replies in the video as Robert kisses her before the congregation.

""I love you. I love you,"" she says as he walks off stage.

""We slept great together last night too, just in case you were wondering,"" she then tells the church. ""We did great, we actually slept.""

The lawsuit claims Cindy facilitated her husband's sexual conduct and the church allegedly took no action against them prior to their departure in 2016.

Doe charged that she was invited to a prayer group at the couple's home once and the pastor groped her breasts and genitals. When she complained to Cindy, the groping was dismissed as an ""innocent mistake.""

Cindy's attorneys denied allegations that she aided and abetted Robert's alleged sexual conduct and insisted Doe's allegation of groping was ""an innocent mistake.""

Doe said when she eventually complained to other pastors at the church but ""those complaints fell on deaf ears,"" the lawsuit said, and she was directed to speak with Litzinger about her concerns directly.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/former-church-for-life-pastor-taught-young-women-to-masturbate-orgasm-in-pre-marriage-classes-suit-says-214698/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
521,598,Franklin Graham Slammed for Defending Trump on Porn Star Allegations,"(Screenshot: Gateway Church The Rev. Franklin Graham speaks at the First Conference at Gateway Church in South Lake, Texas, January 1, 2017.

Evangelist Franklin Graham is being criticized for defending President Donald Trump after accusations surfaced that a lawyer for Trump had paid $130,000 to a porn star to keep quiet about an alleged affair.

""I'm afraid I have to stop recommending Samaritan's Purse. The judgment of its leadership raises too many questions,"" wrote radio host and editor of Resurgent Erick Erickson, on Twitter, responding to Graham's recent interview with MSNBC.

Graham is the president and CEO of Samaritan's Purse as well as the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association.

""Does the president have a sin problem?"" MSNBC ""Live"" anchor Alex Witt asked Graham, referring to the alleged affair with porn star Stormy Daniels.

""He is not president perfect,"" Graham told Witt. ""President Trump I don't think has admitted to having an affair with this person. And so this is just a news story, and I don't even know if it's accurate.""

Graham added that he believes ""at 70 years of age, the president is a much different person today than he was four years ago, five years ago, 10 years ago, or whatever and we just have to give the man the benefit of the doubt.""

Peter Wehner‏, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center think tank, wrote: ""Watching Franklin Graham do all he can to yet again shield Trump from criticism, after having done the same thing on behalf of Roy Moore, is painful, discouraging and corrosive to the Christian witness. The best you can say is he's blind to the damage.""

Moore, an unsuccessful Alabama Senate candidate, was also recently accused of sexual misconduct.

The Rev. Dr. William Barber‏, an author and president and senior lecturer of Repairers of the Breach, tweeted, ""Brother @Franklin_Graham, we do have a sin problem. Our politicians are like ravenous wolves. And preachers like you are covering for them.""

O. Alan Noble, managing editor and co-founder of Christ and Pop Culture and an assistant professor of English at Oklahoma Baptist University, said it is often claimed that evangelical ""elites"" opposed Trump while lay evangelicals backed him. ""But this depends entirely on how you define 'elite.' Virtually every single major evangelical figure in the national political space backed Trump, like Graham,"" he wrote.

Journalist and columnist Roland Martin tweeted, ""Want to see why white conservative evangelicals have sold their soul to @realDonaldTrump, just listen to @Franklin_Graham. My man @Frank_Schaeffer has been exposing these sometimey Christians for a LONG Time.""

Earlier this month, The Wall Street Journal reported that a lawyer for Trump had paid $130,000 in hush money to Stormy Daniels.

Daniels, whose given name is Stephanie Clifford, has claimed to multiple publications that she had sex with Trump around the time that his wife Melania had given birth to their son, Barron. According to the story, Daniels and Trump began their affair in July 2006 at the American Century celebrity golf tournament in which Trump invited the porn star into his hotel room and they had what she later described as ""textbook generic"" sex.

On MSNBC, Graham was also asked about his support for a president who was recently accused of referring to Haiti, El Salvador and African nations as ""s***hole countries.""

Graham said he doesn't think it's hypocritical. ""He said he didn't say it, so I have to go along with the president in that he didn't say it,"" Graham said.

""Why are we having all these people from s***hole countries come here?"" Trump allegedly asked during a recent meeting at the Oval Office in the White House with several Republicans and Democrats during immigration negotiations, according to The Washington Post, which also reported that the president said he would prefer people from countries like Norway to come to America instead.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/franklin-graham-slammed-for-defending-trump-on-porn-star-allegations-214614/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

""My thing was to really make Jesus, gospel and music as cool and relevant as it really is. I want to bring that back in a way that will bring family together, not just youth,"" the boisterous musician told CP in 2016.

559,638,US House Passes Bill Requiring Doctors to Save Babies Who Survive Abortions,"(Photo: Reuters) Baby born premature seen in this undated photo.

The House of Representatives on Friday passed the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which would require healthcare workers to provide care to babies who are born alive after an abortion attempt. All Republican representative voted in favor, and almost all Democrats opposed it.

The House voted 241-183 to pass the bill, which seeks to ensure some measure of protection for the newborns who manage to live through abortions, with only six Democrats voting for it, according to National Review.

The bill carries fines and imprisonment for medical professionals found to be noncompliant, and would grant the woman on whom the abortion is performed civil cause of action and protection from prosecution if her child is not cared for after birth.

""Justice and compassion took a great leap forward today,"" Marjorie Dannenfelser of the Susan B. Anthony List said in a statement. ""We thank leader [Kevin] McCarthy, R-Calif., and our allies in the House for holding a timely vote on this crucial bill, as hundreds of thousands of pro-life Americans rally at Congress' doorstep.""

Rep. Judy Chu, a Democrat from California, claimed, however, ""This bill is a solution in search of a problem. It's unnecessary, redundant, and part of a broader attack on women's health and [abortion] from the chamber and the Trump administration.""

The bill will now need 60 votes to pass through the Senate.

""We urge the Senate to follow their colleagues' lead and pass the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act as well as the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would end cruel late-term abortions after five months of pregnancy,"" Dannenfelser added.

The Senate may soon vote on the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, a bill that seeks to ban abortion after 20 weeks of gestation on the basis that a baby is capable of feeling pain during an abortion and after that point of pregnancy.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/us-house-passes-bill-requiring-doctors-save-babies-who-survive-abortions-214534/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

Mallette took to Instagram to write an open letter to her pop star son who has been growing in his relationship with God.

""I'm so proud of the amazing young man you are, and the young man you are becoming. None of us are perfect and never will be, (so we will always need patience and grace for each other), but your genuine growing relationship with Jesus is evident in the choices you are making daily and the good 'fruit' you bear,"" she wrote. ""I admire your character and integrity. You are maturing beautifully and wise beyond your years.""

Mallette went on to reveal other great qualities about her son, including his sense of humor and heart.

Bieber once had a strained relationship with his mother, which he blamed on some rebellious behavior in 2014 that resulted in his arrest for a DUI. In a previous interview with Billboard, Bieber revealed that he was ashamed to face his mother after taking part in other questionable acts like assaulting a limousine driver, egging his neighbor's home, and urinating in his jail cell.

""I was distant because I was ashamed. I never wanted my mom to be disappointed in me and I knew she was,"" he said. ""We spent some time not talking, so it takes time to rebuild that trust. She's living in Hawaii now, so it's hard, but getting better.""

Despite their struggles, Bieber referred to Mallette as ""an amazing woman and I love her.""

Bieber's mother helped him develop a relationship with God at a young age.

""When I was 7, she wouldn't let me listen to anything but [Pastor] Judah's tapes falling asleep,"" Bieber told Billboard.

In a previous interview with Access Hollywood, the mother and Nowhere But Up author revealed her parenting style which consisted of letting Bieber make his own decisions.

""You have to sort of let them make some of their own decisions,"" she said. ""Me, personally, I would love to be with him all the time and to be able to ground him and deal with his problems and do all of that stuff. But at some point the parenting style changes. I hope to still be a respected voice in his ear.""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/justin-biebers-mom-lauds-pop-stars-relationship-jesus-214453/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
561,640,4 Notable Speeches at March for Life 2018,"Expand | Collapse (Screenshot: March for Life) Tens of thousands of people gather at the National Mall for the 45th annual March for Life in Washington, D.C., January 19, 2018.

Tens of thousands of pro-life activists of all ages came to National Mall in Washington, D.C. on Friday for the 45th annual March for Life.

Held in response to the controversial 1973 landmark Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade, this year's theme was ""Love Saves Lives.""

This year, President Donald Trump gave a speech from the White House Rose Garden via satellite to the marchers, the first sitting president to do so in the history of the annual event.

As with past years, the march was preceded by a large rally at the National Mall, which had a main stage in which several speakers ranging from celebrities to members of Congress gave remarks.

Here are four notable speeches from this year's March for Life, centering on different aspects of the movement.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/4-notable-speeches-march-for-life-2018-214437/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

Clergy who knew the Cranberries frontwoman Dolores O'Riordan have been reflecting on the late singer's faith as they help the family grieve over their unexpected loss.

On Monday, the 46-year-old singer-songwriter from the popular rock group died unexpectedly in London. While the cause of death has yet to be determined, those in the Catholic community who knew her are speaking about the loss.

The singer's funeral will be held at the Church of Saint Ailbe in Ballybricken, Ireland, on Jan. 23. Father James Walton, the priest in O'Riordan's home parish, recalled first meeting the singer when she attended church with her mother.

After her untimely death, he has been praying with her family.

""They have no idea how Dolores died. They received a phone call with the news and are in shock. She was here only last week,"" Walton told the Daily Mail. ""I visited the family and prayed with two of her brothers. I met Dolores when she came to church with her mother.""

Despite her fame, the priest recalled how humble O'Riordan was when she attended church.

""There were no airs or graces about her being a celebrity and all that,"" he said. ""She was a perfectly nice woman and blended into the church.""

Bishop Brendan Leahy of Limerick recalled O'Riordan growing up in a neighboring Archdiocese of Cashel and remembered her as an inspiration.

""Of course, she was a superstar and an inspiration to so many people, not least from Limerick. Limerick City, all of Limerick, held her very dear in its heart,"" he told Catholic News Service. ""Her rise to stardom gave a huge amount of belief to young people locally at the time.""

Even with fame, Leahy said, ""she never lost sight of who she was and where she was from.""

According to the bishop, the singer's music reflected her spiritual beliefs.

""She also often spoke about her spirituality and how important that was to her and, of course, she met Pope John Paull II,"" he said. ""She spoke of taking a lot of influence for her music from her spirituality. Limerick and the world has lost a kind, soft-hearted, talented soul.""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/catholic-leaders-remember-faith-cranberries-frontwoman-dolores-oriordan-214490/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
563,642,Trump Rolls Back Obama Warning to States on Defunding Planned Parenthood,"(PHOTO: REUTERS/JOSHUA ROBERTS) U.S. President Donald Trump walks to Marine One as he departs for a day trip to Kenosha, Wisconsin, from the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, U.S., on April 18, 2017.

The Trump administration has announced that it's revoking the Obama-era policy of restricting state governments from denying Medicaid funds to Planned Parenthood on the grounds that they are abortion providers.

Department of Health and Human Services under Obama issued the warning in 2016 when 24 states denied Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood following an undercover investigation by the Center for Medical Progress exposed the abortion provider's alleged business of selling aborted babies' body parts.

The Trump administration rescinded the guidance Friday in a letter to state Medicaid directors, which said the guidance favored abortion providers, according to The Hill.

""Reinstating the pre-2016 standards frees up states to once again decide for themselves what reasonable standards they use to protect Medicaid programs and their beneficiaries,"" Charmaine Yoest, assistant HSS secretary for public affairs, was quoted as saying. ""This is part of the Trump administration's effort to roll back regulations the Obama administration put out to radically favor abortion.""

""No American taxpayer should be forced by unelected Washington bureaucrats to pay for abortions,"" Alliance Defending Freedom Legal Counsel Elissa Graves said in a statement. ""Medicaid dollars should go to local community health centers serving women — not the scandal-ridden billion-dollar abortion industry.""

ADF thanked the Trump administration ""for its leadership in protecting women's health and defending the sanctity of life.""

""President Trump and his administration have taken a monumental stand for conscience rights and an important step toward getting American taxpayers out of funding the abortion industry, especially Planned Parenthood,"" Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List, said.

""Despite reporting record income, Planned Parenthood's non-abortion services are in steep decline, clients are leaving, and dozens of facilities have closed,"" Dannenfelser added. ""Meanwhile, the abortion chain does more than 320,000 abortion procedures per year, and they are under federal investigation for their role in the harvest and sale of aborted babies' body parts for profit.""

The revoking of the Obama-era policy may not allow states to cut off funding to Planned Parenthood, as existing federal law is seen by some courts as restricting the states from doing so, but the measure does show the administration's support to the states that would like to deny funds to the abortion provider.

Earlier this month, HHS unveiled a new division, known as the Conscience and Religious Freedom Division, meant to defend the conscience rights of medical professionals who hold moral or religious objections to things like abortions or gender reassignment surgery.

""No one should be forced to choose between helping sick people and living by one's deepest moral or religious convictions, and the new division will help guarantee that victims of unlawful discrimination find justice,"" said Severino. ""For too long, governments big and small have treated conscience claims with hostility instead of protection, but change is coming and it begins here and now.""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/trump-rolls-back-obama-warning-states-defunding-planned-parenthood-214513/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
564,643,Tim Tebow Continues to Defy Odds: N.Y. Mets Invite to Major League Spring Training,"(Photo: Reuters/Jasen Vinlove/USA TODAY Sports) Tim Tebow speaks with the media after his workout at the Mets Minor League Complex.

Major League Baseball team the New York Mets, have once again formally invited Christian athlete Tim Tebow to join their team for spring training in St. Lucie, Florida.

The announcement was made Friday and sports fans are wondering whether or not this means he is one step closer to being promoted to the major leagues. Tebow is currently a part of New York Mets' Class A affiliate team, the Fireflies.

The former NFL quarterback played for the Mets' minor league system all of 2017, batting .226 with eight home runs and 52 RBIs in 126 games. He kicked off the season in Columbia, South Carolina, in the South Atlantic League but was promoted to the Florida State League to play for Class A St. Lucie in late June.

The 30-year-old came out the gate swinging when he first joined St. Lucie. He batted .317 over his first 25 games and had a 12-game hitting streak while playing outfield and as a designated hitter. According to ESPN, out of 93 qualified hitters in the South Atlantic League at the time, Tebow landed at No. 85 as was still promoted to high A ball.

Now, the Mets inviting Tebow to big league camp once again guarantees that he will be in the lineup and actually play in the games for spring training.

Many have criticized the Heisman Trophy winner's ability to play baseball, some even claiming that he only has a position in baseball because he can help sell t-shirts, jerseys and fill the stadium seats. However, Tebow continues to defy the odds by being an example for others who wish to live out their dreams.

Tebow has said that playing major league baseball has always been a childhood dream of his and although numbers like his wouldn't normally garner a major-league invite, his age has pushed the Mets to accelerate his progress.

At the 2017 SABR conference in New York last year, Mets General Manager Sandy Alderson told fans that they enjoy having Tebow a part of the Mets family.

""We signed him because he is a good guy, partly because of his celebrity, partly because this is an entertainment business,"" Alderson told attendees according to a report. ""My attitude is 'why not?'""

Fireflies President John Katz told reporters during a press conference last season that Tebow has greatly impacted the clubhouse.

""His contributions, both on the field and in our community, have made a tremendous impact on our team, the City of Columbia and the entire South Atlantic League,"" Katz said. ""We wish Tim the best as he continues his journey to Citi Field.""

Because of his celebrity status, Tebow helped push the Fireflies' average attendance up nearly 40 percent over a year ago. Tebow maintained that he's not thinking about the naysayers.

""It's not something that I have to answer,"" he said at that press conference. ""I just try to go out there and try to work. A lot more smarter, wiser people than me that make those decisions.""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/tim-tebow-continues-defy-odds-ny-mets-invite-major-league-spring-training-214538/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
574,653,"Methodists, Church of England May End 200-Year Split to 'Sustain Christian Presence'","(Photo: REUTERS/Nigel Roddis) Members of the Church of England's Synod vote on one of the motions during the session during which approved the consecration of women bishops, in York, July 14, 2014.

Leaders of the Church of England will debate at their governing body next month whether they should have a priest-sharing arrangement with the Methodists to ""sustain Christian presence.""

The proposal will be discussed at the General Synod in February, as there are ""serious challenges in sustaining a Christian presence,"" according to The Telegraph, which spoke to some leaders of the denomination.

""Whilst such co-operation is already possible and practised in many rural contexts, priests/presbyters exercising ministry in both churches at the same time could build on that in new ways,"" the Rt Revd Dr Christopher Cocksworth, Bishop of Coventry, said in a statement.

Cocksworth explained, ""These would include helping one another to maintain a reliable pattern of public worship in the communities they serve, fostering imaginative initiatives in mission, and enabling strategic decisions to be made about which communities will be the particular focus for ministers serving overlapping geographical areas.""

Methodism originated as a revival within the 18th century Church of England and became a separate denomination after the death of John Wesley.

Some senior figures are, however, warning that the arrangement could be ""very problematic.""

The Church of England's top civil servant, William Nye, said the proposal could be divisive given that Methodist clergy who had not been ordained by a bishop would be allowed to hold Church of England services.

Nye added that the plan would break the ""continuous apostolic succession"" that Church of England members believe links their clergy and bishops to the original followers of Jesus Christ.

A survey released earlier this month by the Christian humanitarian charity Tearfund showed that only 20 percent of U.K. adults pray regularly, or at least once a month, but only 9 percent go to church regularly.

The survey also showed that more than half of adults, 51 percent, say they ever pray, but only one in three people pray in a place of worship.

According to data released by the Church of England last year, an average of 930,000 people, 14 percent of whom were children, attended weekly worship services during October 2016.

The smallest 25 percent of churches reported no children attended on average.

A survey commissioned by the Church of England found last year that only 6 percent of British adults are practicing Christians.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/methodists-church-of-england-may-end-200-year-split-sustain-christian-presence-214542/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
678,769,Red Hydrogen One Specs: Smartphone Coming This Summer With Holographic Display,"Facebook/RED Hydrogen One Red's first ever smartphone, the Hydrogen One, boasts of a holographic display.

While a specific release date is yet to be announced, Red has revealed that its first ever smartphone is slated to arrive this summer.

After more than six months of taking pre-orders for its first-ever smartphone, Hydrogen One, Red has announced earlier this week that it will finally be out this summer as the smartphone is already set to enter mass production. The announcement was made by Red's CEO and founder, Jim Jannard, who also revealed the additional new specs for Hydrogen One.

According to Jannard, the 5.7-inch screen of the Hydrogen One will boast of two modes: A regular 2D mode and a 4-View (4V) holographic mode, also known as the brand's version of 3D. For Jannard, though, the holographic mode is better than a 3D images even without the accompanying 3D glasses as proven by those who have already experienced 4V in person, who, according to the Red CEO, reacted with ""gasps, swears or just grins.""

While the 4V format of the Hydrogen One is new, Jannard suggests that it will get support from different social media sites. Furthermore, the Red CEO also revealed that his company will establish a ""Hydrogen Network,"" which will be a platform for the new format.

""This will be the one place to find all 4V content online. From major studios and other content providers to creating your own channel,"" Jannard said.

Although it can't be denied that its holographic ability is the major selling point of Hydrogen One, it is not the only thing it boasts of. Apart from a body that is made of either aluminum or titanium, Hydrogen One also packs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835X processor and comes with a dual SIM slot, 4,500mAh battery, USB-C port, built-in speakers capable of playing multi-channel spacial audio, stackable modules that connect via pogo pins for power and data, expandable storage via a MicroSD slot, and a headphone jack.

While all its specs and features are nothing short of impressive, Hydrogen One can only prove that it is worth its $1,200 price tag when it is finally dropped on the market this summer.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/hydrogen-one-news-reds-first-ever-smartphone-to-arrive-in-summer-boasts-of-holographic-display-214907/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

The Department of Health and Human Services has unveiled a new division meant to defend the conscience rights of medical professionals who may hold moral or religious objections to things like abortions or gender reassignment surgery.

Known as the Conscience and Religious Freedom Division, the entity will exist under HHS' Office of Civil Rights and help to enforce conscience rights.

OCR Director Roger Severino said in a statement released Thursday morning that religious freedom laws are ""just empty words on paper if they aren't enforced.""

""No one should be forced to choose between helping sick people and living by one's deepest moral or religious convictions, and the new division will help guarantee that victims of unlawful discrimination find justice,"" stated Severino.

""For too long, governments big and small have treated conscience claims with hostility instead of protection, but change is coming and it begins here and now.""

Acting HHS Secretary Eric D. Hargan stated that the new division was part of the Trump administration's overall effort to advance religious liberty protections.

""President Trump promised the American people that his administration would vigorously uphold the rights of conscience and religious freedom. That promise is being kept today,"" stated Hargan in a statement released Thursday.

""The Founding Fathers knew that a nation that respects conscience rights is more diverse and more free, and OCR's new division will help make that vision a reality.""

Since taking office, President Donald Trump has sought measures to broaden religious exemptions to HHS policies, like the Obama era contraception mandate.

Last October, the administration passed two new rules allowing for both for-profit and non-profit entities to get exemptions from the Affordable Care Act law requiring employers to provide birth control coverage.

""The Republican president signed an executive order in May asking for rules that would allow religious groups to deny their employees insurance coverage for services they oppose on religious grounds,"" reported Reuters last year.

""The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on Friday moved to broaden those narrow religious exemptions to include an exception 'on the basis of moral conviction' for non-profit and for-profit companies.""

The new division has come under fire from some liberal organizations, who claim that the initiative will be used to advance discrimination.

""This is the use of religion to hurt people because you disapprove of who they are,"" said Harper Jean Tobin of the National Center for Transgender Equality, as quoted by Politico.

""Any rule that grants a license to discriminate would be a disgrace and a mockery of the principal of religious freedom we all cherish.""

Others, including Ryan T. Anderson of the Heritage Foundation, have argued that this negative portrayal of the new division and its conscience protections are inaccurate.

""I don't know of a single example of a doctor who 'refuses' to 'treat transgender patients.' I do know of some examples of doctors who can't do sex-reassignment therapies because they think they are bad medicine,"" tweeted Anderson on Thursday morning.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/trump-religious-freedom-health-workers-hhs-division-conscience-214268/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
946,1072,"Anne Graham Lotz: Nuclear Strike, Earthquake Could Be Coming to Unrepentant America","(Photo: The Christian Post/Samuel Smith) Anne Graham Lotz speaks at the Family Research Council's 2016 ""Watchmen on the Wall"" conference in Washington, D.C. on May 26, 2016.

Evangelist Anne Graham Lotz has warned that severe punishment is coming to America — anything from a massive earthquake to a nuclear strike — which she said will be a ""game-changer.""

Lotz, founder of AnGeL Ministries, told the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association's Decision Magazine on Monday that God is trying to get America's attention through the natural disasters and violence that have already befallen the country.

She warned that even more severe punishment could be on the way, however.

""And I'm talking about something like a nuclear strike, an earthquake that splits us in two, an EMP (electromagnetic pulse) attack that devastates our electrical grid. Something major that would be a game-changer for America, because we are so defiant and rebellious and idolatrous and immoral, and we know better,"" she said.

The Daniel Prayer author warned that America continues to sin and refuses to repent, which is when God backs away.

""You don't repent and you continue to sin and you become defiant, and He backs away further until in the end, God just turns you over to yourself,"" she said.

""That's where America is today. Look at the end of Romans 1. He's just backed away from us, turned us over to ourselves. As they say, 'America, how's that working for you?'""

The daughter of Billy Graham argued that the global conflicts and tensions are only the ""birth pangs"" before the return of Jesus Christ, reminding Christians that Matthew 24:7 in the Bible speaks of a time when ""nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines, pestilences and earthquakes in various places.""

Still, the evangelist said that God might spare America destructive judgment if Christians start turning toward repentance, such as the Jews did in Joel 2.

""God tells them, 'If you will return to Me and rend your hearts, not your garments, who knows but that I will return to you and leave behind a blessing?' So if America — and I don't mean America as a whole because I wouldn't expect America as a whole to repent of her sin — but if Christians would come back to the cross, and if we would rend our hearts,"" she suggested, calling on people to live unto God.

This isn't Lotz's first warning. She spoke out against what she called the serious divisions in America on a number of occasions in 2017.

""The atmosphere in our world is explosive. Toxic. Dark. Dangerous to the extreme. And at this very moment when our nation should be standing together against wickedness and lawlessness, we are seriously divided,"" Lotz wrote on Facebook in August.

""It's time to 'inquire of the Lord.' Now! It's time to humble ourselves and pray and seek God's face and turn from our wicked ways, so He will hear from heaven and forgive our sin and heal our land. (2 Chronicles 7:14),"" she urged.

The evangelist further warned in September that God may be hiding Himself from the U.S. because of its ""national sins.""

""Our nation is in a mess. Why? Could it be because America is losing God's blessing? And His favor? Could our sin be provoking His judgment? Judgment that is not necessarily in the form of a nuclear dirty bomb, or in another ISIS attack, or in an economic collapse,"" she wrote in an op-ed piece for HelloChristian.com.

""But in a Romans 1 judgment that is described as 'the wrath of God being revealed against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness' ... and God is backing out of our national life and turning us over to ourselves.""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/anne-graham-lotz-nuclear-strike-earthquake-could-be-coming-to-unrepentant-america-214269/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
947,1073,Siblings Spent 2 Years Plotting to Escape From Abusive 'Christian' Parents Who Now Face Life in Prison,"(Photo: Facebook) David Allen Turpin, 57, and his wife Louise Anna Turpin,49, are pictured here with their 13 children.

The severely malnourished and abused children of David Allen Turpin and his wife, Louise, who were rescued Sunday from their home by police in Perris, California, after their 17-year-old sibling escaped and alerted authorities, spent two years plotting their freedom from the house of horror.

Riverside County District Attorney Mike Hestrin called what the Turpins' 13 children endured over the course of their lives at the hands of their parents an extreme case of ""human depravity"" as he laid out the allegations against them at a press conference Thursday, the Desert Sun reports.

""I will tell you as a prosecutor, there are cases that stick with you, they haunt you,"" Hestrin said. ""Sometimes in this business we are faced with human depravity. That is what we are looking at here.""

Hestrin explained that the children, ranging in ages from 2 to 29, were starved so much their growth was stunted. It is alleged that the Turpins would buy food like apple pies and leave them uneaten on a counter to taunt the children who were frequently tied up with rope. They would then be hogtied when they tried to escape.

According to CBS, their 29-year-old sibling weighed just 82 pounds, and a 12 year old weighed as much as an average 7 year old.

After being beaten and choked in chains for months at a time, the children began planning their escape two years ago and on Sunday, their moment of deliverance came. Their 17-year-old sister armed with an inactive cell phone escaped through a window and dialed 911 leading authorities to the home.

What police subsequently saw was shocking, Hestrin explained, according to CBS.

""One of the reasons for the punishments were if the children were found to wash their hands above the wrist area, they were accused of playing in the water, and they would be chained up,"" Hestrin said, noting the siblings were allowed to shower no more than once a year.

In more than four years, he said, none of the children had been to a doctor and they had never seen a dentist. They had very little knowledge of the outside world and were poorly homeschooled.

Just one of the older siblings attended classes at a local college and he was strictly supervised by his mother.

The siblings were reportedly forced to sleep during the day and stay up at night. Their parents would also buy them new toys but never let them take the toys out of the box.

Hestrin said the only entertainment the children had was writing in journals and authorities had recovered hundreds of journals which are being checked for evidence of how the siblings lived.

""I think those journals are going to be strong evidence of what occurred in that home,"" Hestrin said.

On Thursday, David and Louise Turpin were charged with 12 criminal counts of torture, seven counts of abuse of a dependent adult, and 12 counts of false imprisonment that could keep them behind bars for life if they are convicted. David Turpin also faces one count of committing a lewd act by force or fear. He and his wife have both pleaded not guilty and are now being held on bail of $13 million each.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/siblings-spent-2-years-plotting-to-escape-from-abusive-parents-who-now-face-life-in-prison-214432/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

Two house church pastors in China have been told they must pay a fine of over 7 million yuan (over 1 million USD) because they collected the same amount in offerings from their congregation.

Pastors Su Tianfu and Yang Hua of Huoshi Church in Guizhou province have been facing the fine since May 2017, China Aid reported, but it was only earlier this month that a provincial court delivered a final verdict and confirmed the punishment.

Su and Yang have been told that the money they collected from church offerings is ""illegal income,"" despite their argument that they have only used the money for the church itself.

China Aid noted that Huoshi Church was founded in 2009 and had been informing officials of all of its religious activities, following Chinese law.

Still, Communist government officials have targeted the church on a number of occasions, and arrested Yang in December 2015, charging him with ""the crime of obstructing justice"" and ""gathering a crowd to disturb public order.""

Yang's wife, who was not named, claimed that when she arrived to pick him up on his release date, he had a black hood pulled over his head and was put in an unlicensed vehicle. A month after that, he was charged with ""divulging state secrets.""

Yang reportedly endured torture while in custody, and his family was threatened with harm, before he was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison on Jan. 5, 2017.

Shandong-based lawyer Zhao Yonglin accused Communist Party officials of abusing Yang into making a confession.

""The so-called state secret was a document prepared by a temporary city administrative task force calling for the destruction of Living Stone Church. But the decision itself was illegal and should have been exposed instead,"" Zhao said at the time.

Chen Jiangang, another lawyer for the pastor, explained that China is carrying out political persecution.

""Even a day in jail is too much for an innocent person,"" Chen told Radio Free Asia. ""I have only one thing to say about this. This isn't a judgment: it's persecution.

""This is a political case that has nothing to do with the law or the truth.""

Chinese Christians, a growing minority whose churches have been subjected to a widespread crackdown for years, are fearing persecution will get even worse in 2018, following the government's destruction of an evangelical megachurch, captured on video.

Chinese military police detonated explosives inside Golden Lampstand Church in Linfen on Jan. 9, destroying the $2.6 million house of worship, despite the fact that it is owned by the Christians who worship there.

""The repeated persecution of Golden Lampstand Church demonstrates that the Chinese government has no respect for religious freedom or human rights,"" said China Aid President and founder Bob Fu.

""ChinaAid calls on the international community to openly condemn the bombing of this church building and urge the Chinese government to fairly compensate the Christians who paid for it and immediately cease these alarming demolitions of churches.""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/chinese-govt-fines-pastors-over-1m-demanding-all-of-the-churchs-offerings-214399/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
949,1075,Theologian Calls on Trump-Backing Evangelicals to Admit They've Been Wrong After 'S***hole' Remarks,"(Photo: REUTERS/Dave Kaup) U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump (R) shakes hands with co-headliner Jerry Falwell Jr., leader of the nation’s largest Christian university, during a campaign event at the Orpheum Theatre in Sioux City, Iowa January 31, 2016.

A prominent Baptist theologian has written an open letter to his fellow evangelicals, calling on President Donald Trump's supporters to admit they have been wrong, following Trump's alleged ""s***hole countries"" or ""s***house countries"" comment.

""Trump's language and the worldview it expresses are absolutely contrary to everything truly, authentically evangelical (or just Christian!),"" Roger E. Olson, professor of Christian Theology of Ethics at George W. Truett Theological Seminary of Baylor University, wrote in a blog post Thursday.

""My fellow evangelicals who continue to support and even defend Trump in spite of everything he has said about the weak and vulnerable people of the world: It is time to admit you have been wrong and stop defending the indefensible. Trump's labeling of certain countries as 'sh*thole countries' because they are impoverished (often as a result of European and American colonialism and exploitation!) is blatantly racist — given their common racial identity,"" he added.

""But, even worse, it is not only vulgar but also blasphemous — insofar as God loves the people of those countries, too. To label them 's***hole countries' from the seat of power and privilege because they are poor and weak is to stand against Jesus who loved this world so much that he came into it to save it rather than just condemn it as it deserves (John 3:16-17).""

Olson's criticism stems from the much-reported on comments attributed to Trump during an Oval Office meeting on immigration last week, when the president is said to have referred to Haiti, El Salvador, and African nations as ""s***hole countries.""

What is more, Trump said America should take in more immigrants from European countries like Norway instead.

The precise wording and context of Trump's reported remarks have been widely debated. Trump has denied saying those words and some lawmakers who were at the meeting say the president did not make those exact remarks. But others, including Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin, affirmed that the controversial comment was made.

Members on Trump's evangelical council have been divided over the alleged remarks.

Megachurch pastor Jentezen Franklin, who leads the Free Chapel Church, was one of those who criticized the language used, stating:

""I don't agree with what the president said this week. It was wrong what he said. I say that respectfully. There's no nations that are trash and I'm putting it kind what he said. There's no people in those nations that are worthless and trash.""

The Rev. Dr. Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, stated that calling other countries ""s***holes"" is ""wrong, inappropriate, and hurtful.""

""Why? Because when God looks at these nations, He sees His children,"" Rodriguez said.

""Every single person is created in the image of God. Without exception.""

Council spokesman Johnnie Moore, meanwhile, expressed doubts on the veracity of the claims, arguing that they are ""absolutely suspect and politicized.""

Olson, who in his blog noted that he has been an evangelical his entire life, pointed out that Jesus Christ himself was a ""citizen of a 's***hole country' if there ever was one,"" clarifying that that is what Trump's labeling would argue.

""In fact, however, we evangelicals believe the whole world is a 's***hole country' compared with the glory from which Jesus came when he was born in Bethlehem,"" he wrote.

Olson said that he is unwilling to give up the ""evangelical"" label even as it becomes increasingly difficult to hold on to, with many in society associating it automatically with support for Trump.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/theologian-calls-on-trump-backing-evangelicals-to-admit-theyve-been-wrong-after-shole-remarks-214419/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
950,1076,Singer Beckah Shae Gives Camila Cabello's 'Havana' a Christian Remix That Goes Viral (Listen Here),"(Screen Shot: YouTube) Camila Cabello's ""Havana"" gets a Christian remix by Beckah Shae, January 9, 2018.

Singer Beckah Shae is back with another cover tune and this time she's revamped top 40 hit ""Havana"" by former Fifth Harmony singer and pop sensation Camila Cabello.

The vocal powerhouse transformed the mainstream lyrics ""Havana, ooh na-na "" into ""Hosanna, Hosanna, all of my heart is cryin' Hosanna, Hosanna.""

Shae then sings, ""He's comin' back soon, we need Him more than ever! All of my heart's cryin' Hosanna. He's raising up a standard, Hosanna, Hosanna.""

The Christian pop singer-songwriter wrote all the lyrics to the worship remix.

""We need to wake up, acknowledge His presence (When He comes in the room)/ And hear what He's sayin/ Cause there's a message/ That's right we need the truth/ We're doin' forever in a minute (hey)/ Your race is up to you/ And Abba says He's gone help us win it,"" Shae belted out for the first verse.

The YouTube cover song has garnered over 100,000 plays in its first week and is still climbing.

The singer often partners with her husband and music producer, Jack ""Shoc"" Shocklee, to create music. All of Shae's projects to date have been a collaborative effort between the two.

Shae and Shoc were married in 2004 and are parents to three daughters. Their two eldest daughters share their parents' gift for music.

While they've managed to create and release content together throughout the years, Shae's admitted that the music industry hasn't been supportive of their ideas.

In a 2014 interview with Breathecast, the singer described the times she and her husband walked into major record labels with the vision they felt God had given them, but the companies weren't interested. Set on changing Shae's direction, some of these faith-based labels even criticized her for working with her husband and told her to go back to college.

""We had so much rejection, and a lot of times we feel like we've had no support,"" she said. ""It crushed us and hurt us, but we walked out stronger.""

Shae is now offering her talents on Patreon, a new service that allows creatives to get paid by running a membership business for their fans.

951,1077,Young Mother on Verge of Suicide Says Visit to Craig Groeschel's Life.Church Saved Her,"(Screenshot: Twitter/Life.Church) Britny Richardson in a video for Life.Church posted on January 15, 2018.

A young mother, who one day was on the verge of suicide as she felt she was unable to care for her children, has shared her inspirational story of speaking to God during a visit to pastor Craig Groeschel's Life.Church, which she says saved her.

""I didn't realize what being a single mom would be like. There are days where I couldn't afford to feed myself, and I would ask my mom to please feed my kids before they came home after I got them from work,"" Britny Richardson says in a video posted by Life.Church on Twitter earlier this week.

""I got so depressed, and I decided that I was going to sign my kids over to their dad, and I was just going to end my life,"" Richardson adds.

She says that she went to church one more time and that she remembers asking God ""please help me.""

""And God showed me His grace, and His love, and His mercy,"" she states, which was followed by video clips of her recieving a water baptism.

""It's amazing to see what God's doing in so many lives through this church, and I get to be one of them,"" she comments.

The video noted that there have been 1,554 baptisms at the 24 locations of the Edmond, Oklahoma-based megachurch.

The topics of suicide and mental health have been gaining prominence in Christian churches across America in recent years, with Saddleback Church pastor Rick Warren and his wife, Kay, holding spotlighting the extent of the problem following the suicide of their son in 2013.

""As suicide loss survivors, Rick and I know firsthand the almost unbearable agony that accompanies the suicide of someone you love. We ache for those in our congregation — and in yours — who are experiencing despair,"" Kay Warren wrote in September 2017 for World Suicide Prevention Day, referring to the couple's loss of their 27-year-old son, Matthew.

""These friends — brothers and sisters in Christ — need to know that their church is a safe place to share the inward torment of their pain, and that their pain will be met with deep compassion and acceptance.""

More than 800,000 people die by suicide each year and 25 times as many make suicide attempts, statistics have shown, among them pastors and church leaders.

Back in December, Bill Lenz, a Wisconsin pastor who focused his ministry on suicide prevention, had taken his own life after a months-long battle with depression.

""Over the last three months, he had what he would have just called anxiety. He would have bouts where he would be close to panic attacks or he would have panic attacks. And it was just so mysterious for him because he had never dealt with anything related to that at all,"" Christ the Rock Community Church's executive pastor, Curt Drexler, told The Christian Post in an interview at the time.

""It was troubling to him. 'Like where did this come from.'""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/young-mother-on-verge-of-suicide-says-visit-to-craig-groeschels-life-church-saved-her-214403/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
952,1078,Former Pro-Choice Atheist Tells Evangelicals for Life How God Transformed Her,"(Photo: The Christian Post | Samuel Smith) Trillia Newbell, the director of community outreach for the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, speaks at the 2018 Evangelicals for Life conference hosted at the J.W. Marriott in Washington, D.C. on Jan. 19, 2018.

WASHINGTON — Trillia Newbell is a former atheist who considered children a ""nuisance.""

""What is funny is that I am here at a pro-life event talking about the love of children. It's crazy. Why? There was a time when I would have thought that children were a nuisance, a bother, expendable,"" she shared at the third annual Evangelicals for Life conference on Friday.

""There was a time when I thought that children didn't matter and all that mattered where those of us that were adults and teens walking around. I was pro-choice. But, I wasn't just pro-choice. I was pro-choice to an extreme. Go to the extreme and there I was. I also wasn't a Christian.""

Newbell explained that although she grew up in a loving home and was taught by her father the importance of loving people of all races and backgrounds, she never fully grasped the concept of personhood in the womb because she didn't believe that babies in the womb were people.

""My views became more and more radical throughout my teen years and into my early 20s,"" she said.

While working at a summer camp when she was just 19 years old, Newbell explained that God was ""gracious"" enough to put her in a room with a girl that she recalls being ""on fire for Jesus.""

""I was 19 and I was teaching a private camp. She was my assistant and we happened to be in this room by ourselves together. I will never forget when she sat on the bed to open her Bible during quiet time. I immediately got incredibly defensive and asked her, 'What are you doing?' She said, 'Having quiet time,'"" Newbell said, as she tried to mimic her assistant's cheerful voice.

""I thought Christians were crazy and I thought, 'If you are about to take that Bible and say something with it, I am going to take that Bible and smack you,'"" she continued. ""That's where I was, which is so hard for people to think of if you know me now because the Lord did amazing work.""

Newbell explained that by the end of the night, she was crying, confessing her sins, and telling her assistant her life story.

Despite the powerful experience that night, Newbell said that she did not give her life to Christ that night because she had a boyfriend that she ""did not want to give up at that time.""

It was at the age of 22, Newbell stated, that she was ""humbled"" after suffering from two broken engagements to be married.

""I remember going to her church and hearing that hymn 'Rock of Ages.' There is a line — 'Wash me Saviour or I'll die,'"" she recalled. ""I knew at that moment that I needed a savior. My life was transformed immediately. The Lord radically transformed my life.""

Newbell told the audience that Ephesians 2 sums up her testimony.

""At the beginning it says, 'I was dead following the prince of the power of the air, following the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience. We all live there too in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body in mind, children of wrath.' That was me,"" she told the crowd. ""Verse 4, 'But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which He loved us even when we were dead in our tresspasses made us alive together with Christ.' By grace, I was saved. It was grace that I wasn't looking for, grace that I didn't know that I needed. God miraculously saved me.

""God takes dead people and gives them resurrection life. That's what He did. He took a dead girl and gave her resurrection life. God radically transformed everything about me, all of me. He transformed my heart and He also transformed my mind. He transformed my worldview.""

Newbell said that she began to understand that she too, was created in God's image and that realization changed how she viewed ""all people.""

""That moment when I started to understand that image of God and that God placed value and dignity into people, that meant that Psalm 139:13 wasn't just something religious people read and talked about but was true that God knit together babies in a mother's womb,"" she asserted. ""That meant that those with disabilities are important and valuable to the Lord and therefore, important and valuable to me.""

As she learned more about what was important to the Lord, she began to understand that her views on things like abortion and end-of-life ""didn't fit"" with her new faith.

""What it meant and what I was learning was that all life mattered to the Lord, all life. From the womb until the day we face Jesus it matters to God. Therefore, it matters to me and it matters to us,"" she proclaimed.

Newbell, who is now an author and director of community outreach for the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, explained that she eventually realized that the kind of love her father was teaching her to have for other people before he passed away when she was 19 was not his idea, but God's idea.

""When I became a Christian at the age of 22, the Lord became my Father,"" Newbell said. ""I understood what it meant to be fatherless. The Lord helped me see that my desire for equality and the dignity of people made in His image ... was His desire.""

Although two broken engagements were part of what ultimately led Newbell to Christ when she was 22, Newbell explained that her boyfriend that she chose over God when she was 19, Thern Newbell, ended up accepting Christ. The Newbells have been married for 15 years and have two kids.

""God takes dead people and gives them resurrection life. He reconciled us first to Himself and then to each other,"" she explained. ""Here is what I want you to know. My testimony is radical, if you knew me when I was 19 and in my 20s and how opposed I was to things of the Lord. There are people who are walking around right now who need Jesus. If God can transform my heart and I am speaking here and I work for the ERLC, it's radical and it's ridiculous. He can do that for and with anyone.""

The Evangelicals for Life conference kicked off Thursday and is being hosted by the ERLC. Newbell's testimony was delivered just before the March for Life.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/former-pro-choice-atheist-tells-evangelicals-for-life-how-god-transformed-her-214428/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

President Donald Trump has become the first sitting president of the United States to directly address the annual March for Life.

Speaking via satellite from the Rose Garden of the White House on Friday, Trump stated that he was ""honored"" and ""proud"" to be the first commander-in-chief to address the March for Life.

""Today, tens of thousands of families, students, and patriots, and really just great citizens, gather here in our Nation's Capital,"" said Trump, his speech broadcast on a large screen before the March for Life rally attendees at the National Mall.

""You come from many backgrounds, many places, but you all come for one beautiful cause: to build a society where life is celebrated, protected, and cherished. The March for Life is a movement born out of love. You love your families, you love your neighbors, you love our nation, and you love every child, born and unborn, because you believe that every life is sacred, that every child is a precious gift from God.

""Because of you, tens of thousands of Americans have been born and reached their full God-given potential.""

Expand | Collapse (Screenshot: March for Life) Tens of thousands of people gather at the National Mall in Washington, D.C., for the 45th Annual March for Life, Jan. 19, 2018.

During his remarks, Trump touted his pro-life efforts as president, including the reinstituting of the Mexico City Policy, which bans the government funding of abortions overseas, and reversing an Obama-era policy that made it hard for state governments to defund Planned Parenthood. Most recently, his administration issued a new proposal to protect conscience rights of medical professionals.

Noting that the United States is one of seven countries that allows elective abortions after 20 weeks, Trump also denounced such abortions as ""wrong"" and that ""it has to change.""

""We are protecting the sanctity of life and the family as the foundation of our society, but this movement can only succeed with the heart, the soul, and the prayer of the people,"" added Trump, who called life ""the greatest miracle of all.""

He ended, ""We are with you all the way.""

Vice President Mike Pence, who spoke in person at the 2017 March for Life, gave introductory remarks wherein he called Trump ""the most pro-life president in American history.""

""From preventing taxpayer dollars from funding abortion overseas to empowering states to respect life in Title X, to nominating judges who will uphold our God-given liberties enshrined in the Constitution of the United States, this president has been a tireless defender of life and conscience in America,"" stated Pence.

""And know, as you march for life, that your compassion, your persistence, your activism and your prayers are saving lives. And this pro-life generation should never doubt we are with you, this president stands with you, and He who said 'Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you,' is with you as well.""

Trump's remarks came as part of the 45th anniversary March for Life, the large annual rally at the District of Columbia held on or around the anniversary of the landmark Supreme Court decision, Roe v. Wade.

This year's theme for the March for Life was ""Love Saves Lives,"" which March for Life President Jeanne Mancini stated last October was the fundamental premise of the pro-life movement.

""Choosing life is not always easy, but it is the loving, empowering, and self-sacrificial option. Love is universally attractive because it is directed towards others,"" stated Mancini.

""Love is what we all strive for because deep-down we are all drawn to give of ourselves in this way. Love saves lives in countless ways.""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/donald-trump-becomes-first-president-to-address-march-for-life-we-are-with-you-all-the-way-214431/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
1017,1158,Ex-Muslim Humanist Facing Death Threats Denied UK Asylum Because He Can't Identify Aristotle,"(Photo: Reuters) Bust of Aristotle. Marble, Roman copy after a Greek bronze original by Lysippos from 330 BC/National Museum of Rome, in this undated photo.

A Pakistani humanist who doesn't want to return to his country after he rejected the Islamic faith and received death threats has reportedly been denied asylum in the U.K. because he failed to identify ancient philosophers Plato and Aristotle.

The Guardian reported on Wednesday that Britain's Home Office found Hamza bin Walayat's knowledge of humanism ""rudimentary at best,"" and disputed his claims that his family in Pakistan wants to kill him because he rejected Islam.

The publication shared the details of the letter of rejection Walayat received, which accused him of being ""unable to provide a consistent or credible account with regards the main aspect of your claim, namely that you are a humanist.""

""When you were informed by the interviewing officer that he was referring to Plato and Aristotle, you replied: 'Yeah, the thing is because of my medication that is strong I just forget stuff sometimes,'"" the letter states.

The Pakistani man, who had been living in the U.K. since 2011, pointed out that people who leave Islam in Pakistan are subjected to discrimination, persecution and violence.

Walayat said that he had applied for asylum in July 2017, after he had overstayed his student visa.

""I've told the truth and instead of believing me they are trying to find excuses to kick me out of the country,"" he said.

Bob Churchill of the International Humanist and Ethical Union wrote a letter in support of Walayat's asylum application, stating: ""For many, the broad descriptive 'humanist' is just a softer way of saying atheist, especially if you come from a place where identifying as atheist may be regarded as a deeply offensive statement.""

Andrew Copson of Humanists U.K. added that the decision sets a ""dangerous precedent for non-religious people fleeing persecution. The Home Office is simply incorrect to claim that non-religious people seeking asylum don't get the same protection in law as religious people do.""

A Home Office spokesperson said in response to the story: ""The U.K. has a proud history of granting asylum to those who need our protection and each claim is carefully considered on its individual merits.""

Christians converts from Islam, who also face heavy persecution in their own countries, have complained in similar cases of being rejected asylum in the U.K. for failing to answer questions on the Bible.

One Iranian convert to Christianity, identified as Mohammed, said in 2016 that his failure to answer Bible trivia does not mean he does not believe in the faith.

""One question they asked me was very strange — what color was the cover of the Bible,"" he said. ""I knew there were different colors. The one I had was red. They asked me questions I was not able to answer — for example, what are the Ten Commandments. I could not name them all from memory.""

Wilson Chowdhry, chairman of the British Pakistani Christian Association, also commented on Walayat's case, and said: ""It makes no sense that if people in the U.K. are being persecuted for quitting Islam and joining movements such as Humanism or holding no faith, that they could return to Pakistan a country steeped in Islamic radicalism and enjoy a good quality of life.""

He added: ""There is a large existing number of reports of attacks on people who deny Islam for other faiths, belief systems or no faith. Pakistan has several known blasphemy convictions based on a de facto position against those who reject Islam — clear examples of apostasy hatred.""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/islam-rejecting-humanist-facing-death-threats-denied-uk-asylum-because-he-cant-identify-aristotle-214425/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
1018,1159,US Supreme Court to Hear Trump Travel Ban Case,"(Photo: Reuters/Patrick T. Fallon) People protest Donald Trump's travel ban from Muslim majority countries at the International terminal at Los Angeles International Airport in Los Angeles, California, January 28, 2017.

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday agreed to decide the legality of President Trump's latest temporary travel ban targeting six Muslim-majority countries.

The Supreme Court is due to hear arguments in April and issue a ruling by the end of June on whether the policy violates federal immigration law or the U.S. Constitution's prohibition on religious discrimination. Trump's policy, announced in September, blocks entry into the United States of most people from Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.

The legal fight involves the third version of a contentious policy Trump first sought to implement a week after taking office in January 2017.

The Supreme Court, which is handling a series of closely watched cases, signaled on Dec. 4 it was likely to uphold the ban when, on a 7-2 vote, it let it go into full effect while legal challenges by the state of Hawaii and others continued. Lower courts had partially blocked the ban.

The president has said the policy is needed to protect the United States from terrorism by Islamic militants.

Those challenging the policy have argued it was motivated by Trump's enmity toward Muslims, pressing that point in court with some success by citing statements he made as a candidate and as president.

As a candidate, Trump promised ""a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States."" As president, he has rescinded protections for hundreds of thousands of immigrants who were brought into the country illegally as children and sought to ramp up deportations.

Immigration arrests have tripled since January 2017 to an average of 142 people a day, though actual deportations are down from the rate under Trump's Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama.

""We have always known this case would ultimately be decided by the United States Supreme Court. This will be an important day for justice and the rule of law. We look forward to the court hearing the case,"" said Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin, a Democrat.

A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment.

The ACLU pursued a separate legal challenge in Maryland that is now before the Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

""The Supreme Court can and should put a definitive end to President Trump's attempt to undermine the constitutional guarantee of religious equality and the basic principles of our immigration laws, including their prohibition of national origin discrimination,"" ACLU lawyer Omar Jadwat said.

'THE NATION'S INTEREST'

The case represents a high-profile test of presidential powers. In court papers, U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco, arguing for the Trump administration, said the president has ""broad authority to suspend or restrict the entry of aliens outside the United States when he deems it in the nation's interest.""

The latest ban was introduced on Sept. 24 after what Francisco called an ""extensive, worldwide review"" to determine which foreign governments provide information required by the United States to vet those seeking entry. The countries on the list are those that do not share that information or present ""other heightened risk factors,"" Francisco said.

Hawaii's lead lawyer Neal Katyal said in court papers that the president has only limited authority to exclude entry of people from other countries.

Under a U.S. law called the Immigration and Nationality Act, a president can restrict entry only of those deemed a potential threat or in certain emergency situations. The law also prohibits discrimination on the basis of nationality.

The law does not ""surrender to the president a boundless authority to set the rules of entry and override the immigration laws at will,"" Katyal said in court papers.

Trump's ban also covers people from North Korea and certain government officials from Venezuela, but lower courts had already allowed those provisions to go into effect.

Although lower courts have ruled against Trump over this three travel bans, the Supreme Court has given him a friendlier reception.

In a series of emergency actions, it has issued decisions at least in part favorable to Trump without ever resolving the legal merit of the policies.

The justices in June revived parts of Trump's second ban he signed in March.

There are some exceptions to Trump's most recent ban. Certain people from each targeted country can apply for a visa for tourism, business or education purposes, and any applicant can ask for an individual waiver.

For people from the eight Muslim-majority countries named in any of Trump's three bans, there was a 41 percent drop in visas granted to enter the United States last year compared to before the bans were announced, government data showed.

Courts in Seattle and Maryland ruled the current ban unlawful, prompting the administration to appeal. Before the Supreme Court's December order, the lower courts had allowed the ban to go into effect for those with no close relatives in the United States or ""formal, documented"" relationships with U.S.-based entities such as universities and resettlement agencies.

1019,1160,Catholic Church Uses Minnesota Viking Win to Invite Fans to Mass,"(Photo: Facebook: Our Lady Of Lourdes Catholic Church) Our Lady Of Lourdes Catholic Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota posted a social media message on January 15, 2018 to invite Minnesota Vikings fans to church.

One Minneapolis church is making the most of the Vikings' championship journey by encouraging fans to make good on their promises to attend mass.

On Jan. 14, the Vikings bested the New Orleans Saints with a game-winning touchdown that fans have been calling the ""Minneapolis Miracle."" Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church Communications Director Julie Craven decided to tap into that ""miracle"" by urging fans on social media to attend the Minneapolis, Minnesota, church.

""If you made any promises during the last 10 seconds, Sunday masses are 8:30 a.m., 11 a.m. and 7 p.m. at Our Lady Of Lourdes Catholic Church,"" the message posted on Monday states.

Craven wrote the message after the witnessing the excitement of the Vikings game herself and knew that she had to utilize social media.

""It was one of the most emotional moments I've ever experienced. When I got home I couldn't sleep,"" she told CBS Minnesota. ""I mean, the adrenaline was still kind of working and I thought, 'You know what? There is a social media post out there.'""

While her social media post got thousands of likes in 24 hours, Craven admitted she had no idea how big the message would grow.

""I put it out the next morning thinking wouldn't it great if I got like 50 likes,"" Craven said.

""We were just tickled that everyone got a kick out of post, and it's a wonderful tribute to what the Vikings did.""

The Vikings are gearing up to face off against the Eagles in the NFC championship game Sunday. While Craven might have convinced Vikings fans to attend mass during the morning services on Sunday, she may have trouble filling seats at the 7 p.m. service.

1020,1161,"'Forever My Girl' Cast Discuss Faith, Strength in Country Music Rom-Com Characters (Interview)","(Photo: ""Forever My Girl"" movie still) Alex Roe (L) and Jessica Rothe (R) star in ""Forever My Girl in theaters January 19, 2018.

LOS ANGELES — In a cinematic world where action movies reign supreme at the box office, one romantic drama rooted in faith is seeking to make its way into the hearts of audiences.

A dramatic film that fuses elements of faith, comedy, romance, and country music, ""Forever My Girl"" could fit into several genres. The family-friendly movie centers around country music star Liam Page (Alex Roe) who returns home after leaving the love of his life, Josie Preston, (Jessica Rothe) at the altar with an unborn child that he knew nothing about.

After eight years of pursuing a lifestyle of fame and fortune, Liam returns to his small Louisiana hometown to face his former fiancé, his pastor-father, and the daughter he never knew about.

Showcasing faith-based elements in ""Forever My Girl"" was a different experience for producers Mickey Liddell and Pete Shilaimon who previously worked on the 2016 historical biblical drama ""Risen.""

Although Christian values are woven into almost every scene, producer Liddell spoke to The Christian Post about being intentional with the subtleties of the Christian messages.

""I think the idea of Jesus in this situation in this hometown, you can feel it without hitting people over the head. You feel peace, forgiveness, all of the things,"" he said. ""To me I would love people to have more feeling when they leave than say, 'John 3:16' or whatever. It's hard to take that into an entertaining movie.

""The themes here are Christian in the way that they really feel with family.""

They may not be overt, but some faith-based messages like the importance of forgiveness are clear in scenes like Pastor Brian (John Benjamin Hickey) preaching on the topic to his congregation. The pastor is able to share a number of sermons throughout the film, but the three-dimensional character also deals with relatable struggles when he leaves the pulpit that Liddell hopes can touch audiences in a deeper way.

""We were trying to make sure that even with the church and the pastor that he was three-dimensional and real and wasn't someone on the pulpit that said these things and then left without struggles of his own. Obviously, he had struggles,"" Liddell told CP. ""The most powerful [parts of] spiritual films to me are the messages. I can't tell you exactly what they said but I know that feeling.""

Even though Roe plays Liam in the film, the actor mentioned the pastor as one of the movie's characters that best exemplifies what it means to be human.

""He's the town pastor in the movie and he's got all of these words for his congregation, these words to help them out and these words of inspiration,"" the actor said in a roundtable discussion with CP. ""I've spoken to a pastor since who has said that it's difficult to be the pastor at home. It is a really humanizing aspect of that character.""

Unlike the countless romance films that have come before it, ""Forever My Girl"" doesn't tell the story of a woman trying to win the affections of a man. After Josie was jilted at the altar by Liam, her life did not stop or revolve around him.

For Rothe, the actress who portrays Josie in the film, based on the Heidi McLaughlin book of the same name, the leading female character represents strength for women.

""It's actually one of the things that makes this film so unique as a rom-com or romantic film, however you want to look at it. Often times it's the woman chasing the man trying to prove that she's good enough, or worth enough,"" she said. ""I was so drawn to this character because that is a lesson I know that I have to continually learn not only to have inner strength and know your own worth, but to trust that people see that. I think it's very important for young women, young people and older people as well, to know that love is important, but it's also important to find a partner who respects you and loves you the way you deserve to be treated.""

Faith, family, forgiveness and love are all central themes in the movie, but country music serves as the heartbeat that ties everything together. More than just a second thought featured as a film score, country music artists Jackson Odell and Brett Boyett wrote songs to complement Liam's journey.

For months, British actor Roe studied the genre and culture that resulted in him singing, playing guitar and speaking with an accent that would fit right into the country music industry. Roe explained how the film's themes pair well with those found in country music.

""I think that, in my research anyway, country music seems to be grounded in people staying true to their roots, being homegrown and being honest storytellers. Both the country fans really admire that in the artists they follow, and the artists admire that in their following,"" the actor told CP. ""I think that this being a story of coming home in some way and retracing those roots, that's a really important highlight in the country music scene, the country music fans, and the country music artists.""

1021,1162,Nigerian Student Arrested for Converting From Islam to Christianity,"(Photo: World Watch Monitor) Simput Dafup, 33, and Nabila Umar Sanda, 19, have both been arrested

Security forces in Nigeria have arrested a Christian university student in the central state of Nasarawa for converting from Islam to Christianity. They also arrested the man who had taken her to a local church.

Detectives from the Department of State Security Services arrested Nabila Umar Sanda, a 19-year-old student at Bingham University, from the house of a church leader, Jeremiah Datim, and also held her 33-year-old Christian friend, Simput Dafup, who had introduced Nabila to Datim, according to World Watch Monitor.

The officials ""stormed my house, assaulted my wife, daughter and 8-month-old baby, and took Nabila away,"" Datim was quoted as saying.

Dafup was arrested separately, but in a similar fashion.

Simut Dafup's mother, Lydia, recalled, ""The men who stormed my son's premises, heavily armed, in five Hilux vehicles, blocked everywhere and assaulted even passers-by.""

She added, ""It has become so worrisome for me to let you know about this, because, as I speak with you now, I don't know where my son is. Nobody has contacted me or any member of the family as to his whereabouts.""

""Miss Nabila told me she is 19 years old and therefore free to choose a religion for herself,"" Datim said. ""After I met Miss Nabila for the first time … I interacted with her and asked her a lot of questions about both the Christian faith and Islamic faith. Nabila clearly said that she had made up her mind to join the Christian faith and was willing to be a Christian no matter what obstacles were placed on her way.""

The university is owned by one of Nigeria's major churches, Evangelical Church Winning All.

Christians are routinely persecuted in some parts of Nigeria.

At the unveiling of the 2018 World Watch List earlier this month, Open Doors USA CEO David Curry said there were over 2,260 cases of Christian women and girls who were either raped, assaulted or forced into Islamic marriages during the organization's 2017 reporting period.

""In Nigeria, which is No. 14 on the World Watch List, there was a 14-year-old girl this year who was walking to school — the picture of innocence,"" he said. ""As she walked to school, she was kidnapped and taken from her family by a Muslim extremist living in the northern tribal region. She was forced into marriage.""

Curry said that after the child was taken from her family, the extremist kidnapper agreed to sell the girl.

""A deal was cut with the tribal leader under Sharia law to sell this 14-year-old girl, Habiba, for $160,"" Curry explained. ""Do you believe this is unique? It's not.""

A Christian mother and three of her daughters in Nigeria's in Kano state recently faced various forms of abuse for their refusal to convert to Islam and follow in the footsteps of the father, who became a Muslim for a government position.

""They summoned me and demanded I withdraw my daughter from the Christian school, bring her back to the village, and hand her over to them. Since I was helpless, I did as instructed by them and brought my daughter back to them,"" the mother said, according to Morning Star News.

The mother and oldest daughter were arrested in March 2017, but local Christian leaders managed to bail them out.

Two of her other young daughters, aged six and 15, have also been harassed for their faith.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/nigerian-student-arrested-christian-university-converting-from-islam-to-christianity-214533/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

WASHINGTON — Tens of thousands gathered for the annual March for Life Friday, an event many regarded as especially meaningful since it was the first time a sitting U.S. President addressed the crowd via video livestream from the White House rose garden.

Previous pro-life presidents like Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush addressed the march by phone. Last year, Vice President Mike Pence spoke on the main stage at the march.

Jana Duggar turned 28 last weekend and some fans are upset with her father, Jim Bob, for telling a congregation in Australia that his eldest daughter is still single.

The Duggars were invited to speak at Kilsyth South Baptist Church in Australia, and while Jim Bob introduced his children to the congregation, he noted that it was their twins, Jana and John David's birthday.

""Jana — actually, back in the U.S., it's her birthday,"" Jim Bob told the congregation, which can be seen in a video posted on the Duggar family's Facebook page. ""Jana is now 28 years old and still single, so she's still praying about the one the Lord would have for her but she's a fine young lady. And her brother, John, he is not with us but he's a pilot.""

Michelle Duggar added that it's the first time her twins have celebrated their birthdays separately.

Facebook/Duggar Family Official Michelle and Jim Bob Duggar

Although the father most likely meant no harm with his comments about Jana still being single, some people online took offense. Jana and her twin brother are the only Duggar children older than 22 who aren't married.

In 2014, there was speculation that Jana and former NFL quarterback Tim Tebow were in a relationship. However, those rumors were put to rest after a rep for the athlete said the two have never met. The allegations surfaced after Jim Bob and Michelle met Tebow's mother, Pam.

Fellow Christian reality star Lawson Bates was also one of Jana's alleged ""boyfriends,"" but reports of the ""Bringing Up Bates"" son and ""Counting On"" daughter also turned out to be untrue.

Speaking about being the only Duggar daughter older than 22 who's still single, Jana previously said said on an episode of ""19 Kids and Counting"": ""I just think, for me, I am just waiting and we'll see. When God brings that one along it will be His timing.""

1035,1176,Iowa May Be Next State to Offer Bible Classes in Public Schools,"(Photo: Reuters/Brian Snyder) Priscilla Gammon reads along in her Bible during a weekly Bible study meeting at the West Unity Methodist Church in Unity, New Hampshire July 5, 2011.

Legislators at the Iowa Statehouse have introduced a bill that would allow or require schools to teach the Bible as an elective course, but some are opposing it as an ""extreme piece of legislation.""

State Rep. Dean Fisher and 11 other Republicans this week introduced House File 2031, which would direct the state Department of Education to prepare material and teacher training for a high school elective course that focuses on the Hebrew Scriptures and the Bible's New Testament.

""Basically, I want to give students the opportunity to study the Bible from the perspective of its impact on history and culture,"" Des Moines Register quoted Fisher as saying.

""Beyond its literary and cultural significance, which is significant, the Bible is also an essential thread of the American consciousness, and without it, American unity is unraveling,"" Drew Zahn, spokesman for The Family Leader, was quoted as saying.

However, some parents are reportedly concerned.

""We have that separation of church and state that was intentionally put in there as a first amendment and so it to me it wasn't even something that's lawful. It's not something that we should be entertaining,"" a mother, Naomi Homrighausen, who is Jewish, was quoted as saying by ABC News.

Pastor Dave Doyle in Cedar Rapids added, ""There are different faiths we have to recognize that, but this is the one faith that was part of the founding of our nation.""

Atheist groups also oppose teaching the Bible in schools.

Last year, the Freedom From Religion Foundation filed a lawsuit against Mercer County Schools for offering an elective Bible course that existed in some capacity since 1939, but a federal judge later dismissed it.

""This program advances and endorses one religion, improperly entangles public schools in religious affairs, and violates the personal consciences of nonreligious and non-Christian parents and students,"" read the lawsuit.

However, District Court Judge David A. Faber stated that ""Supreme Court jurisprudence has by no means established an absolute bar to the Bible being taught and studied in the public school system.""

Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas are among the states that have similar laws allowing Bible courses to be taught in public schools.

In June last year, Kentucky's Republican Christian Gov. Matt Bevin signed a bill allowing public schools to teach a course on the Bible.

""The idea that we would not want this to be an option for people in school, that would be crazy. I don't know why every state would not embrace this, why we as a nation would not embrace this,"" Bevin said at the time.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/iowa-may-be-next-state-offer-bible-classes-public-schools-214526/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
1116,1273,'EA Sports UFC 3's' Achievements Pay Tribute to MMA Organization's History,"EA Sports UFC 3 official website Plenty of Achievements are featured inside 'EA Sports UFC 3'

""EA Sports UFC 3"" is going to challenge players by asking them to take on the virtual counterparts of some of the best mixed martial artists in the world, but that is not all.

As is the norm with games released during this current generation, the latest entry in the ""EA Sports UFC"" franchise also comes with rewards that players can unlock by completing certain tasks.

For the Xbox One, these are known as Achievements, and the folks from TrueAchievements have provided a list that detailed which ones are going to be included in the upcoming MMA game.

Upon looking at the list, long-time MMA fans may notice right away that the Achievements have been given special names.

For completing the game's introduction, players will unlock the Achievement known as ""UFC 1: The Beginning,"" and when they land a four-hit combo during an online multiplayer match, they get the ""UFC 80: Rapid Fire"" Achievement.

The entire list is made up of Achievements named in a similar manner, and those are not just random words and numbers thrown together.

The names of the Achievements were previously used as designations for specific UFC pay-per-views.

Fans may also notice that the names for the Achievements mostly called back to the earlier days of the organization, and that is probably because the people at the UFC have moved away for the most part from using those additional names for their events.

""EA Sports UFC 3"" players will be able to unlock those specially named Achievements for doing different things inside the game.

There are Achievements available for accomplishing certain things in multiplayer matches and ones for the Ultimate Team mode as well.

Given that the developers have put in work to create a more detailed career mode for this game, it should come as no surprise that there are plenty of Achievements related to it.

MMA fans will be able to start piling up the Achievements inside ""EA Sports UFC 3"" beginning Feb. 2. The game is also coming out for the PlayStation 4 and a Trophy list should pop up online sometime soon.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/ea-sports-ufc-3s-achievements-pay-tribute-to-mma-organizations-history-215043/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
1117,1274,Nvidia Graphics Card Out of Stock: Tech Giant Wants Gamers Put First Instead of Cryptominers,"REUTERS/Mike Blake Nvidia asks retailers to prioritize gamers as graphics cards shortage continues.

Amid shortages in the supply of Nvidia graphic cards, the company recently appealed to authorized retailers to prioritize gamers wanting to purchase its products.

For months now, Nvidia is still looking for ways to catch up with the demand for its graphic cards. In an attempt to remedy the situation, the company reportedly issued a statement that asked retailers to put the gamers' needs first.

Nvidia's Boris Böhles told the German publication ComputerBase (translated by Wccftech): ""For NVIDIA, gamers come first. All activities related to our GeForce product line are targeted at our main audience. To ensure that GeForce gamers continue to have good GeForce graphics card availability in the current situation, we recommend that our trading partners make the appropriate arrangements to meet gamers' needs as usual.""

Gamers may recall that Nvidia usually limits the purchase of graphics cards via its official online store to two units per customer, and this is likely the selling recommendation that the company implied.

However, the company cannot control the units being sold to buyers unless the purchase is made through its website.

While the company appeared to have not directly referred to cryptocurrency miners, reports have linked Nvidia's appeal to retailers to this angle.

It can be recalled in 2017, Motherboard reported that the months-long graphics cards drought could be linked to crypto miners who might be hoarding the hardware. It was learned that graphics cards were a great tool for a faster generation of digital currencies like Ethereum and Zcash. And with the rising prices of cryptocurrencies seen last year, Nvidia could have realized that one of the possible reasons for the supply shortage is the overbuying of its products by miners.

Apart from the difficulty of looking for a graphics card, gamers desperate to upgrade their rig were also met with prices that were practically double the original cost. For example, the cheapest price for a GeForce GTX 1070 Ti on Newegg is $899.99 -- a huge spike from its base price of $449 through Nvidia.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/nvidia-graphics-card-supply-shortage-company-asks-retailers-to-prioritize-gamers-214798/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

Spoilers for the Jan. 25 episode of ""The Bold and the Beautiful"" reveal that it is going to be a day of shocking proposals, with Steffy (Jacqueline MacInnes Wood) begging Liam (Scott Clifton) to not give up on her and spend their future together with their child.

After everything that has happened between them, it looks like Steffy is not ready to give up Liam just yet. In the upcoming episode, she will urge Liam to come home to her and her child and forgive her for the sake of their child. While it seems that Liam has no plans of leaving their child, his proposal to Steffy won't come anywhere near Steffy's expectations.

The episode will find Liam listening to Steffy's plea and eventually giving his alternative solution to their problem. Spoilers for the episode reveal that Steffy will be able to soften him a bit, but her plea won't be enough to let him forgive her right away. Ultimately, Liam will nail down the details of their custody agreement. It remains to be seen what Liam's proposal will be, but spoilers tease that his alternative solution won't give Steffy her happily ever after.

There are speculations that Liam's proposal will involve a compromise, wherein Liam will urge his wife to agree to an annulment before they go any further. Considering what Steffy has done to him, it's possible that Liam will want them to start from scratch as they raise their child together. While he's ready to keep an open mind about their being parents at this point, the story's different when it comes to their being husband and wife.

Elsewhere in the episode, Brooke (Katherine Kelly Lang) will confront Bill (Don Diamont) about his betrayal and guts to prey on Steffy's weakness. She will rip into him for breaking Liam's trust and side with Ridge (Thorsten Kaye), arguing that Bill took advantage of Steffy. However, Bill will tell her that she didn't advantage of Steffy because Steffy also wanted what they did that night.

Abigail (Marci Miller) will deal with Gabi (Camila Bagus) in the next episode of ""Days of Our Lives."" Spoilers for the Jan. 25 episode of the popular soap reveal that Abigail will confront Gabi about her recent threat, where she declared that she would kill Andre (Thaao Penghlis) after the latter stabbed her in the back.

In the upcoming episode, Abigail will try to know if Gabi actually did as she promised. She will suspect Gabi as Andre was actually found dead hours after Gabi threatened him. Spoilers reveal that Gabi will be shocked to know that somebody's actually suspecting her of being a murderer. However, Abigail will tell her that she's done it before when she killed Nick (Black Berris), so it's not impossible that she did it again with Andre.

It's clear that Abigail is grieving in the upcoming episode, but it also seems like her accusations against Gabi won't sit well with the latter. Gabi will think that Abigail is just trying to look for someone to hold responsible for Andre's murder that's why she's pointing her finger at her. Spoilers suggest that Gabi will brush off Abigail's accusations, telling her that what she wanted was simply to file a lawsuit against Andre and not kill him.

Elsewhere in the episode, Lani's (Sal Stowers) situation will get even more difficult for her as JJ (Casey Moss) gushes over fatherhood. Fans of ""Days of our Lives"" have witnessed how troubled Lani has been since she discovered she was pregnant, but it looks like things will get even more difficult for her when JJ learns about her pregnancy and instantly assumes he's the father of her child. It remains to be seen in the upcoming episode if Lani will muster the courage to tell JJ the truth.

1120,1277,NBA Trade Rumors: Why the Golden State Warriors May Be Interested in Adding Kyle O'Quinn,"O'Quinn has been recently mentioned as a player who could be traded by the New York Knicks

Wikimedia Commons/Keith Allison Kyle O'Quinn with the New York Knicks last season

The Golden State Warriors currently feature one of the best rosters ever put together in the history of the league.

In the backcourt, they have two-time MVP and shotmaker extraordinaire Stephen Curry and he is joined by Klay Thompson, a fellow lethal shooter who is also capable of taking on difficult assignments on defense.

Up front, the Warriors run out Draymond Green, a versatile star who puts the team first, and Kevin Durant, a player who can make a serious run at the all-time scoring record before it is all said and done.

Supporting this quartet of stars are playmakers Shaun Livingston and Andre Iguodala, shooters Omri Casspi, Nick Young and the still effective David West.

That is an impressive collection of players, and no team in the league can match that group from a talent perspective.

Still, if the Warriors' roster does feature any weakness at all, it has to be at the center spot.

Centers Zaza Pachulia and JaVale McGee can certainly complement their teammates well on the floor, but both big men are limited in a few ways.

Perhaps the Warriors are aware too that they can still improve their center situation, and that may be why a recent rumor is hinting that the defending champs are interested in adding a big man currently playing for the New York Knicks.

In a recent article, ESPN's Ian Begley shared some information from sources who revealed that the Warriors have shown interest in acquiring Knicks center Kyle O'Quinn.

Within that same article, David Jacober, who serves as a strategic planning consultant for NBA teams, was quoted as saying that it was O'Quinn's ""diversity on offense"" that makes him ""attractive"" to a team like the Warriors.

To be clear, O'Quinn is not one of the NBA's so-called ""unicorns,"" those big men who can do just about everything on the court, but at least on offense, he profiles to be more capable than Pachulia or McGee.

As seen in Basketball Reference, O'Quinn has shown a willingness to take shots even when he is not situated right next to the rim. His numbers also suggest that he can hit a reasonable amount of those shots.

Pachulia and McGee are not quite as effective away from the rim.

Keep in mind too that O'Quinn has put up those shooting numbers with the Knicks. It seems safe to assume that his shooting will improve if he ends up going to the Warriors since he will likely receive more open looks playing alongside Curry, Thompson and Durant.

The Warriors probably do not need O'Quinn to have a good shot at winning the title this year, but adding him can certainly make them even more formidable.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/nba-trade-rumors-why-the-golden-state-warriors-may-be-interested-in-adding-kyle-oquinn-215048/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
1121,1278,NBA Trade Rumors: Utah Jazz' Rodney Hood Heading to Cavs or Pistons?,"Hood could be one of the better players moved during this trading season

Reuters/Russ Isabella-USA TODAY Sports Houston Rockets forward Trevor Ariza (1) defends against Utah Jazz guard Rodney Hood (5) during the second half at Vivint Smart Home Arena.

The NBA's trading season is heating up, and yet another player has just been recently identified as someone who could be on the move.

Recently, The New York Times' Marc Stein reported that there were people in ""league personnel circles"" who believe that the Utah Jazz may be willing to move swingman Rodney Hood ahead of this year's trading deadline.

Stein added that ""multiple teams"" were showing an interest in acquiring Hood, which is not at all surprising.

Players like Hood rarely show up on the trading block.

At just 25-years-old, it is possible that Hood's best years are still ahead of him, and he is a good player right now.

As seen in Basketball Reference, Hood is averaging nearly 17 points per contest, and while he is not doing that super efficiently, he has flashed a diverse enough offensive profile that teams around the league can still dream of him becoming a better scorer.

Hood also has the type of frame that should prevent him from turning into a complete liability on the defensive end.

If the Jazz really are planning to make him available, there are teams that would likely love to add him to their rosters.

The Cleveland Cavaliers could place a call to the Jazz hoping that a first round pick in the 20s and a young player or two could be enough to get a deal for Hood done.

The Detroit Pistons, a team in the middle of a playoff chase, may also inquire about Hood as he could provide needed shooting.

In a recent article, Dennis Chambers of Basketball Insiders noted that Hood could fit in well with the Philadelphia 76ers as a player who can space the floor and also grow with the team's young core.

Teams in the west like the New Orleans Pelicans and maybe the Portland Trail Blazers that are trying to secure playoff spots could also check in with the Jazz to see if they have a chance at acquiring Hood.

Hood is a player who NBA fans are going to want to watch closely, as he could be one of the better cagers moved during this trading season, and he is also someone who can make a difference for a team during the stretch run.

1122,1279,Winds of Winter Release Date Update: Will The Long-Awaited Installment Finally Be Released This Year?,"Reuters/Robert Galbraith George RR Martin's ""Wind of Winter"" has not yet been published and fans have been waiting for its release for years.

Author George R.R. Martin has yet to give any solid update about the release of ""The Winds of Winter,"" but rumors are already swirling around that he will release it in September, in time for his 70th birthday. The sixth book in his ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" novel series has been in development for years, and it should have been released a couple of years ago. However, Martin has only been giving fans vague spoilers about it.

With fans clueless about when to expect the book to arrive and what to expect from it, they are forced to come up with their own theories about the highly anticipated book. Back in 2011, Martin revealed that he was already working on ""The Winds of Winter,"" so many expected it to arrive sometime in 2015 even without the author giving an exact release date for it.

Last July, Martin addressed rumors that he had already stopped working on the book. He took to his official blog to tell his supporters that it was still in the works, although he still did not mention an exact release date. ""I am still working on it, I am still months away (how many? Good question), I still have good days and bad days, and that's all I care to say,"" he wrote.

Last year, reports surfaced claiming that Martin might release his book in September this year as a surprise to his fans on his 70th birthday. Although the rumor has already died down, it resurfaced once again recently after Strand Bookstore listed ""The Winds of Winter"" as one of the ""20 New Books to Look Forward to in the New Year,"" with a release date of Sept. 6. Shortly after posting the listing, the bookstore deleted the entry and replaced it with ""The Winds of Winter by George R.R. Martin (fingers crossed!),"" removing the date. This has led to speculations that the book might actually be done or almost done by now and is only preparing for its September release.

Martin has yet to comment on the controversial listing. Meanwhile, fans will know in the coming months if this year is indeed the year they've all been waiting for.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/will-the-winds-of-winter-finally-be-released-this-year-214729/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
1133,1291,"Is Trump Mentally Fit for Office? Health Results Not Satisfying Media, Mental Health Critics","(Photo: Reuters/Carlos Barria) U.S. President Donald Trump

Many reporters in the White House press corps and critics of President Trump are questioning the results of his physical after U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Ronny Jackson said Tuesday that the commander-in-chief's overall health is ""excellent.""

CNN's medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta, who asked questions at the briefing, said he believes the president has heart disease, disputing Jackson who told Gupta the president ""does not have heart disease.""

""A few years ago, dating back to 2009 President Trump started having these tests that are actually looking for the presence of calcium in the blood vessels that lead to the heart ... and steadily, up until just this past week, when he had them performed again, those numbers have gone up,"" Gupta said on CNN Wednesday, without ever having examined Trump. ""Well, when they get to a certain range, and his number is in the 130s, that means he has heart disease.""

Jackson, who administered Trump's physical that lasted over four hours Friday at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center as well as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment exam that tests a patient's memory and is used to screen for Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis and dementia, fielded an onslaught of questions from the press that ranged from ""does the president wear dentures?"" to whether he's mentally fit to serve in office, to ""what is his life expectancy?"" and ""what is his waist measurement?""

Trump is the first president to have the cognitive assessment performed as part of his physical exam. Trump requested the assessment after this month's publication of Michael Wolff's Fire and Fury alleged he is not mentally fit for office.

Jackson explained that he had ""no intention"" of performing the screening because he sees the president several times a day and had ""absolutely no concerns about his cognitive ability and neurological function.""

The president scored 30 out of 30 on the mental assessment, and Jackson said the president is ""very sharp.""

Jackson did, however, say that Trump needs to lose 10 to 15 pounds this year and eat fewer carbohydrates. He also said the president is taking a medication to lower his cholesterol, Propecia for hair loss, and a medication to treat rosacea.

MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" co-host Joe Scarborough, a former friend of Trump's who's now a frequent critic and has claimed that the president has dementia, is now disputing the president's reported weight.

If ""that's what 6-3, 239 pounds looks like, that's a shock to me."" Scarborough said, according to the Hill.

Scarborough's co-host, Mika Brzezinski, addressed the results of Trump's MOCA test, saying, ""I'm not sure if it makes me feel better that this doctor says he has no cognitive issues. It makes me feel worse and more worried for the country.""

""We won't question the doctor,"" Scarborough said. ""I will say on his mental sharpness, if that is in fact the case, and medically, perhaps, that is, he has shocked and surprised a lot of people.""

Dr. Bandy Lee, an assistant professor in forensic psychiatry at the Yale School of Medicine and co-author of the controversial book, The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump — which includes a commentary by Noam Chomsky warning that Trump is a threat to ""human species' survival"" — told Newsweek Wednesday that the MOCA test Johnson performed on the president last week still doesn't address her concerns about his psychiatric wellbeing.

""The MOCA was not the test she believed he needed,"" Newsweek reported.

""Screening someone with a test you'd give to people who seem normal isn't an effective approach for a person who has already shown signs that require in-depth evaluation,"" Lee argued, according to Newsweek.

In August 2016, after Trump had won the Republican nomination for president, left-leaning media started reporting on claims of Trump's fitness to serve, which led American Psychiatric Association President Maria Oquendo to issue a statement advising members to abide by a principle commonly known as ""the Goldwater Rule,"" which says psychiatrists shouldn't offer opinions on someone they have not personally evaluated.

But that hasn't stopped Lee and her group, the National Coalition of Concerned Mental Health Experts, all of whom are opposed to Trump, from promoting their claims and urging citizens to call their representatives in Congress and warn of ""Donald Trump's dangerousness and the need for immediate evaluation under the provisions of the 25th Amendment.""

In an interview with The Christian Post via email Friday, Lee reiterated her accusations that the president is ""dangerous.""

""He has exhibited multiple dangerous behaviors,"" Lee said, asserting that one ""indication of [Trump's] fragility is how he panders to his 'base,' no matter how extreme and how shrinking, he needs those extraordinary levels of adulation to survive.""

She also cited Trump's use of Twitter as problematic, saying, ""the sheer frequency of his tweets seemed to reflect [his] frantic state of mind.""

Lee then suggested that Trump is to blame for any increases in gun violence, bullying at schools and hate crimes. And warned that he could ""instigate civil conflict, and lay a foundation for a violent culture that could give way to epidemics of violence.""

Lee further argued that Trump ""declaring Jerusalem as Israel's capital"" was like ""poking a beehive in the Middle East.""

""He resorts to violence the more he feels threatened,"" she said, ""and it is a typical pattern. It is a pattern that also echoes through his decision to pull out of the Paris accord, contributing to collective suicidal behavior, and his tax bill that will assuredly increase inequality, which is the most potent stimulant for mass violence — which we might see in terms of suicide epidemics, homicide epidemics or wars.""

In response to her claims that Trump is exhibiting neurological problems, she said she believes he's ""exhibiting signs that appear very neurological, but it is not possible to diagnose from afar, and only a full examination will reveal whether it is neurological, psychological, or medical in origin.""

At the press briefing Tuesday, NBC News Chief White House Correspondent Hallie Jackson was the first to ask about Trump's mental fitness for office. This was followed by a reporter who asked about Trump ""appearing to slur his words"" at a recent press conference.

Jackson said the reason for that was because the president had been taking Sudafed for several days prior and he simply had a dry mouth.

When ABC News' Chief White House Correspondent Jonathan Karl asked Jackson how it was possible for a man who eats fast food, drinks diet cokes and doesn't exercise (other than playing golf) to be ""in as good of shape as you say he's in,"" the doctor explained that Trump hasn't been eating fast food since he's been president because he eats the food the White House chefs prepare for him. Jackson added that Trump ""just has incredibly good genes and it's just the way God made him.""

CNN's Jim Acosta later followed up by asking Jackson if there is anything he's ""keeping from the press for privacy reasons."" Jackson further explained that he's been involved in the last six or seven physical exams [for Obama and now Trump] and ""this is hands down more information that's been put forth by any other assessment [of presidents] to date.""

Richard Benedetto, an adjunct professor of journalism and retired White House correspondent and columnist for USA Today who covered four presidential administrations, told CP that the media's reporting on Trump's mental health ""is all part and parcel of the one goal that the media who cover politics and the presidency seem to have these days, and that's let's get him out of office — that's the goal that they have. And so whatever we can come up with that would hasten that goal is fair game.""

On the other hand, Benedetto said, ""Trump gives them things to play off of because he's brash, he speaks off the cuff, he reacts quickly to when somebody criticizes him. Therefore, he makes it relatively easy for them to then say, 'Ah ha, he's doing this; ah ha, it shows that.' And then they go and ask some psychologist or psychiatrist, 'Well, what does that mean?'

""And what you end up with is this narrative that somehow or other this guy is deranged and mentally unbalanced. And it plays perfectly to those who can't stand him, and it angers those who support him.

""It's one more piece of evidence that the media detractors point to, to say, 'You see, all they want to do is get this guy out, and they don't cover the news fairly, and they don't cover the news honestly, and they don't give us the full story,"" Benedetto added. ""You've got this continuous clash between those who support Trump and those who don't.""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/trump-mentally-fit-office-health-results-media-mental-critics-214134/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

1764,2007,"Gen Z Is the Least Christian Generation in American History, Barna Finds","(Photo: The Christian Post) Youths gather at the Hylton Memorial Chapel in Woodbridge, Va. for day two of ""Reverse,"" an event organized by Dare 2 Share Ministries.

Teenagers today are the most non-Christian generation in American history as only four out of 100 teens hold a true biblical worldview and one out of every eight teens identify as non-heterosexual, a new survey released by one of the nation's leading evangelical polling firms has found.

The Barna Group announced Tuesday the findings from its new research project, ""Gen Z: The Culture, Beliefs and Motivations Shaping the Next Generation,"" sponsored by the Georgia-based Impact 360 Institute.

Barna's research discovered that more teens today who are part of Generation Z (born from 1999 to 2015) identify themselves as agnostic, atheist or not religiously affiliated.

The study indicates that 35 percent of Generation Z teens considered themselves to be atheist, agnostic or not affiliated with any religion. By comparison, only 30 percent of millenials, 30 percent of Generation X and 26 percent of Baby Boomers said the same.

The study shows that almost twice as many teens in Generation Z (13 percent) claimed to be atheist than millenials (7 percent).

""Gen Z is different because they have grown up in a post-Christian, post-modern environment where many of them have not even been exposed to Christianity or to church. So that is a really unique shift,"" Brooke Hempell, Barna's senior vice president of research, said during the survey's rollout event at Grace Midtown Church in Atlanta.

""There are a lot of churches that are empty in this country. Gen Z is the one who is really showing the fruit of that. There are many of them [who] are a spiritual blank slate. For the first time in our nation's history, that is more and more common.""

For the project, Barna conducted a total of four focus groups with U.S. teenagers between the ages of 14 and 17 and also conducted two nationally representative surveys that included responses from a total of 1,997 teens throughout the United States.

The first survey, conducted between Nov. 4- 16, 2016, interviewed 1,490 teens ages 13 to 18. The second survey was conducted on July 7-18, 2017, and interviewed 507 teens between the ages of 13 to 18. The data from both surveys were minimally weighted to U.S. Census data in order to be representative of ethnicity, gender, age and region.

The research also found that just 59 percent Generation Z teens considered themselves Christian or Catholic. By comparison, 65 percent of millennials and Generation X and 75 percent of Baby Boomers identified as some form of Christian.

Although nearly six in 10 Generation Z teens identified as Christians, Barna's research shows that only four percent of Generation Z held a ""biblical worldview.""

Using ""a classification of faith based on widely accepted, orthodox Christian beliefs,"" Barna developed a set of theological criteria that each respondent had to meet in order to be classified as having a biblical worldview.

""The percentage of people whose beliefs qualify them for a biblical worldview declines in each successively younger generation: 10 percent of Boomers, 7 percent of Gen X and 6 percent of Millennials have a biblical worldview, compared to only 4 percent of Gen Z,"" the study explains.

The study also found that just four out of 10 Generation Z teens agreed that the Bible is ""totally accurate in all of the principles it teaches."" Meanwhile, just 61 percent of ""churched teens"" agreed that the Bible is totally accurate in all the principles it teaches.

Just 85 percent of churchgoing Generation Z teens believed that Jesus Christ was ""a real person who was crucified by Rome and was actually physically raised from the dead.""

""Where is that latent unbelief happening? We see a lot of it in science,"" Hempell explained. ""Teens are beginning to feel like they have to choose between science and the Bible, where as the Baby Boomer generation or Gen X said that they can see the Bible and science as being complementary ... When we get to millenials and Gen Z, they see them in conflict.""

According to the data, 28 percent of Generation Z teens believed that ""science and the Bible are complementary."" By comparison, nearly half of Boomers (45 percent) and more than one-third of Generation X respondents (36 percent) said the same.

""For [many], they are going to fall on the side of science,"" Hempell continued. ""A quarter of Gen Z would say, 'I don't see the Bible and science getting along so I am just going to go with what science says because to me that is the truth.'""

Other findings show that 12 percent of Generation Z identified sexually as something other than ""hetrosexual,"" with seven percent saying they are ""bisexual.""

""This is the highest percentage of self-identified non-hetrosexual experience that we are seeing now of any generation,"" Barna President David Kinnaman said during his remarks during the rollout event. ""This is much larger than millenials.""

Additionally, seven out of 10 Generation Z teens said that they think it is acceptable to be born one gender and ""feel like another."" Three out of 10 teens reported knowing someone who had changed their gender identity.

""[Y]oung Christians are struggling as much as we have seen it in the 20-plus years I have been at Barna and in the 35-plus years of our company to understand how to live out their faith in an increasingly skeptical culture,"" Kinnaman said. ""They are having to represent what the Bible says, what it means to be Christian, in a culture that doesn't understand it or who believes that the Bible is simply a book that is religious dogma that has been used to oppress people, that being Christian is extremist or irrelevant in our society.""

""I think about what we might do to use discernment and I am asking you how it is in your church and your context, in your ministry could help kids [today] have a more robust experience of what it means to be Christian,"" he added. ""We need to be thinking theologically. We need to challenge them. They are ready to be challenged more than the church is willing to challenge them.""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/gen-z-is-the-least-christian-generation-in-american-history-barna-finds-214856/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
1765,2008,Univ. of Iowa Ordered to Reinstate Christian Student Group Punished Over Policy on Homosexuality,"(Photo: REUTERS/Koh Gui Qing) School mascot Herky the Hawk stands in front of the Old Capitol Museum at the University of Iowa, in Iowa City, Iowa, U.S. May 22, 2016.

A federal judge ruled Tuesday that the University of Iowa must temporarily reinstate a Christian student group that was punished last fall because it denied a leadership position to a gay student who refused to accept the club's statement of faith opposing homosexuality.

Judge Stephanie Marie Rose of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa granted Business Leaders in Christ's (BLinC) request for a preliminary injunction and ordered that the state school reinstate the group as a registered campus student organization for at least 90 days.

""The court agreed that the university has to stop discriminating against BLinC because of its religious beliefs,"" Eric Baxter, a senior counsel with the religious freedom law firm Becket, which is representing BlinC in the case, said in a statement. ""Every other group on campus gets to select leaders who embrace their mission. Religious groups don't get second-class treatment.""

BLinC filed a lawsuit against the school in December after they were kicked off campus because the school deemed that the organization violated its policy on discrimination by asking student leaders to sign a statement of faith that requires them to adhere to lifestyle and moral standards that exclude engaging in ""sexual immorality"" and other behavior deemed sinful.

The group requested expedited relief so that they could be allowed back on campus to participate in the University of Iowa's spring recruitment fairs being held Wednesday, one of the biggest opportunities of the semester for student clubs to recruit new members. A hearing was held last Thursday.

Rose wrote in her decision that the school doesn't seem to fairly apply its human rights policy.

Although BLinC was punished for having a religious restriction in its leadership policy that went against the school's policy on discrimination, the Muslim campus group Imam Mahdi is seemingly allowed to have a policy in which membership benefits are reserved for Shia Muslims and leaders must ""refrain from major sins (kaba'ir) and endeavor to avoid minor sins (saga'ir).""

""[T]he court must conclude on the current record that BLinC has shown that the university does not consistently and equally apply its Human Rights Policy,"" the judge wrote in her decision. ""This raises an issue regarding whether BLinC's viewpoint was the reason it was not allowed to operate with membership requirements that the university had determined violated the policy, while at the same time Imam Mahdi was not subjected to any enforcement action.""

""In light of this selective enforcement, the Court finds BLinC has established the requisite fair chance of prevailing on the merits of its claims under the Free Speech Clause,"" the judge's decision continued.

After a student complained last year to school administration about the BLinC policy requiring leaders to adhere to a statement of faith that opposes homosexuality, among other sins, school administrators demanded that the group revise its policy. According to Becket, the school required BLinC to submit an ""acceptable plan"" for selecting leaders if it wanted to be reinstated.

""The university would never let Iowa State's Cy the Cardinal lead the Hawkeyes,"" BLinC Student President Jacob Estell said in a statement Tuesday. ""So why would it think it is OK to force religious student groups to select leaders who don't embrace their mission?""

The University of Iowa released the following statement after the court's ruling:

""The court has ordered the university to restore BLinC to registered student organization status for 90 days,"" the school's statement reads, according to The Gazette. ""The university respects the decision of the court and has acted accordingly by extending an invitation to BLinC to participate in the student organization fair on Jan. 24. The university will not comment on the merits of the case per its policy on pending litigation.""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/university-iowa-ordered-reinstate-christian-student-group-punished-homosexuality-policy-samuel-smith-214990/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
1766,2009,NFL Turns Down 'Please Stand' Ad From Veterans Group Because of Its Political Bent,"(Photo: Facebook)

AMVETS, a group which describes itself as the nation's largest and oldest Congressionally-chartered veterans service organization with 250,000 members, has expressed outrage and disappointment with the National Football League after the group's one page ad with the message ""Please Stand"" was rejected by the NFL's Super Bowl program.

""Freedom of speech works both ways. We respect the rights of those who choose to protest, as these rights are precisely what our members have fought — and in many cases died — for. But imposing corporate censorship to deny that same right to those veterans who have secured it for us all is reprehensible and totally beyond the pale,"" AMVETS National Commander Marion Polk wrote in a Jan. 22 letter to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.

In a statement to USA TODAY Sports, NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said the Super Bowl game program is not a place for making political statements.

""The Super Bowl game program is designed for fans to commemorate and celebrate the game, players, teams and the Super Bowl,"" McCarthy said. ""It's never been a place for advertising that could be considered by some as a political statement. The NFL has long supported the military and veterans and will again salute our service members in the Super Bowl with memorable on-field moments that will be televised as part of the game.""

McCarthy further noted that Veterans of Foreign Wars, another veterans service organization which boasts nearly 1.7 million members, also submitted an ad for the Super Bowl program which was approved.

The tagline on VFW's ad reads: ""We Stand for Veterans"" with additional messaging that describes the benefits the organization offers.

Expand | Collapse (Photo: AMVETS) The controversial AMVETS ad.

He said AMVETS was asked to modify its messaging to meet the deadline for the Super Bowl game program but they did not respond in time.

""We looked to work with the organization and asked it to consider other options such as 'Please Honor our Veterans,'"" McCarthy told USA Today. ""They chose not to and we asked it to consider using 'Please Stand for Our Veterans.' Production was delayed as we awaited an answer. As the program was going to production, the organization asked about including a hashtag (#PleaseStand) and was informed that approval would not be provided in time and was asked to approve the ad without the hashtag. The organization did not respond and the program ultimately went into production to meet deadlines.""

Joe Chenelly, executive director of AMVETS, told Fox News that they were surprised that there was any concern with the ad that was accepted by the NHL and NBA and is scheduled to run in the official programs for each organization's all-star games.

He also denied that they had missed any deadlines for the Super Bowl game program.

""That statement outlines a series of events that we did not experience. We were highly engaged with the advertising agency. This statement also talks about the fact that there was an agency between us and the NFL. They are the ones who we communicated with, they are the ones who came and pitched us for this ad and we met all the deadlines. We did respond to them at the end where we told them 'no, we're not changing our message and our message is our values and we can't change our values.""

He argued that the NFL has gone out of its way to respect freedom of expression for players in the league but has not done so for AMVETS, which is a diverse organization.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/nfl-turns-down-please-stand-ad-from-veterans-group-because-of-its-political-bent-214992/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
1767,2010,"Pastors Protest 6th Grade Assignment Claiming Christians, Muslims Worship 'Same God'","(Photo: Facebook/School District U-46) A School District U-46 school bus is parked in Elgin, Illinois, in this undated file photo.

Concerned Christians have voiced their outrage over a homework assignment given to area students which claimed that Muslims, Christians and Jews all worship the same God.

The Elgin Courier-News reports that over a dozen concerned citizens spoke out during a school board meeting on Monday in opposition to a homework assignment handed out to sixth grade students within the Elgin Area School District U46.

The homework assignment in question was first brought to people's attention when school board member Jeanette Ward voiced her disgust with the assignment last month.

Ward took to social media after her sixth grade daughter brought home an assignment that included an article in which the author claims that the three major Abrahamic religions worship the same God. Ward's objection was to the assertion that Muslims worship the same God as Christians and Jews and argued that such a claim is ""utterly incorrect and false on many levels.""

Expand | Collapse (Photo: Facebook.com / Jeanette Ward, U-46 School Board Member)

According to Ward's Facebook post from Dec. 14, the assignment states that ""Muslims, Christians and Jews all worship the same complex God. But each religion believes that its books and teachings reveal the true nature of that God. This disagreement has shaped the course of human history.""

After reading the article, students were asked to answer comprehension questions.

""By bringing this matter to light, Ms. Ward has done great service for all the sixth-graders and their parents in School District U46,"" Elgin resident L. Dean Hufsey was quoted as saying during the meeting.

Art Ellingsen, a pastor Arlington Heights, was also present at the meeting a refuted the claim.

""To say that Allah of the Quran and the God of the Bible are the same is simply absurd,"" Ellingsen was quoted as saying.

According to the Elgin Courier-News, another concerned resident argued that such an assignment shows that the school system is ""playing with children's eternal lives.""

""It's not just something flying in the wind, it's not just a political issue, it is a faith issue, and faith issues are very important to a lot of people in this community,"" Pastor Mark Frusti was quoted as saying during the meeting.

Ward has received much criticism for her social media posts about the homework assignments and Islam. In a school board meeting that took place in December, four faith leaders from different congregations spoke out against Ward's social media posts.

""We feel that, more important than the content of the article is the question of how we are to engage with inevitable differences of opinion, theology and worldview,"" Katie Shaw Thompson, pastor of the Highland Avenue Church of the Brethren in Elgin, said during the December meeting, according to the Elgin Courier-News. ""Here, we strongly take exception to Ms. Ward's approach on her social media post.""

On Tuesday, Ward responded to criticisms that she has made the homework assignment issue too ""political.""

""What is 'political' and HYPOCRITICAL is indoctrinating students with assignments like the one discussed last night, with a decidedly POLITICAL, non-scholarly, inaccurate, agnostic, and progressive ideology, expecting that those with an opposing view would have nothing to say about it,"" Ward wrote on her Facebook page.

""This is not an isolated incident. The idea that Muslims, Christians and Jews worship the same God is taught repeatedly in U-46 curriculum resources and textbooks, which I have pointed out on many occasions. That is why I posted this particular assignment on my page. I voted against the specific curriculum resource (Newsela) in May of 2016. It was approved, 6-1, and will not be reconsidered.""

The debate over whether Muslims worship the same God as Jews and Christians received national attention in late 2015 and early 2016 after the Illinois evangelical higher education institution Wheaton College suspended political science professor Larycia Hawkins for posting on her Facebook page the claim that Christians and Muslims worship the same God.

The college's board of trustees later said that suspending Hawkins for making the theological assertion was an ""error in judgement.""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/pastors-protest-6th-grade-assignment-claiming-christians-muslims-worship-same-god-samuel-smith-214994/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
1768,2011,Atheist Group's Demand That Pastor-Led Student Program Be Banned Is Rejected by School District,"An Indiana school district won't be ending a lunchtime leadership program led by pastors from a local church despite complaints from the nation's largest atheist legal group.

On Tuesday, Superintendent Rod Gardin of the East Porter County School Corporation sent a letter to the Wisconsin-based Freedom From Religion Foundation informing the atheist group that the school district doesn't plan to ban the ""Elevate Students"" program that's offered at Kouts Middle/High School.

The Elevate Students program is run by two pastors associated with the Assemblies of God-affiliated Heartland Christian Center and gives students the opportunity to engage in character and leadership-building activities during their lunch period.

Gardin's letter, which was obtained by The Christian Post, comes in response to a letter he received earlier this month from FFRF, which advocates for a strict separation of church and state, asking that the school district ""discontinue allowing the Elevate program to operate during the school day.""

In the FFRF letter, written by staff attorney Ryan Jayne, the organization explained that it had received several complaints from parents that alleged the two pastors were engaging in religious instruction during their lunchtime sessions.

Jayne argued that it's unconstitutional for the school district to offer religious leaders ""access to befriend and proselytize students during the school day on school property.""

Gardin, however, said in his response Tuesday that FFRF had its facts wrong and the pastors leading the program were not engaging in any form or religious instruction or proselytization.

""In response to your assertion that the school corporation is allowing religious instruction to occur during the school day at Kouts Middle/High School through the Elevate Students program, I analyzed the curriculum used in the program,"" Gardin wrote. ""There is no religious content in the curriculum. There are no Bible verses, references to any spiritual deity, or any activities that expose students to any religious concepts.""

Gardin even stressed that he watched several video clips that are shown to students to reinforce the concepts they learn from the program. According to Gardin, ""all of them were free from any religious content.""

""I spoke with the facilitator of the program, Matt Willingham. Mr. Willingham confirmed that no verses from any type of religious text are used,"" Gardin assured. ""He added that he would be happy to meet with any parent or group of parents who would like to know more about Elevate Students.""

Gardin added that at the end of the Elevate Students program, students are asked to share what they learned from the program.

""The students' comments have been transcribed for improved legibility and are enclosed,"" the letter reads. ""You will find that none of the students described any type of spiritual awakening or realization. What they learned were life principles that are religion neutral that will assist them in developing into adults who can lead their families and communities in productive ways.""

Gardin told CP in an email that he received a complaint from a parent earlier this school year about the Elevate Students program. However, when Gardin informed the parent that the program was not religious but merely a secular character building program, he never heard back from the parent.

Gardin asked FFRF to issue a retraction of its Jan. 16 news release in which the organization claims that the school district is allowing preachers to proselytize to students.

""Since it has been demonstrated the school corporation is not allowing preachers to proselytize at one of our schools, I request you remove the erroneous information from your website regarding this topic and replace it with a retraction apologizing for the error,"" the letter reads.

As of Wednesday afternoon, no retraction was issued by FFRF.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/atheist-groups-demand-pastor-led-student-program-banned-rejected-school-district-215012/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
1769,2012,Parents Warn Virginia School District May Ban Public Comments Opposing Gender Identity Policy,"(Photo: Reuters/Lucy Nicholson) Students walk past a protest sign on a bathroom which helped lobby for the first gender-neutral restroom in the Los Angeles school district at Santee Education Complex high school in Los Angeles, California, U.S., April 18, 2016.

One of the nation's most influential public school boards is considering changes to its procedures on public comments which would bar parents from speaking on issues that concern them, particularly those related to gender identity and sex education.

In Fairfax County, Virginia, which neighbors Washington, D.C., the school board is expected to vote Thursday on what sources close to the matter say is a measure that would further censor and restrict them and other concerned citizens from giving feedback by clamping down on the public comment process.

The concerned parents who spoke with CP on condition of anonymity said the Public Engagement Committee met Monday and intends to dramatically alter their current rules and procedures for public speakers at FCPS school board meetings, which occur every other week. Public commenters can then only speak on school board agenda items which the board can carefully and narrowly dictate and eliminate any opportunities for walk-in speakers to address the topic they want. It would also reportedly ban substituting speakers and sharing speaker time.

""It's a con game,"" one parent said to CP.

Controversy erupted in the county in 2015 when the FCSB voted to replace biological sex with ""gender identity"" in official school guidelines. Only one FCSB member dissented.

The new policy holds that boys who self-identify as female can use the girls' shower facilities, locker rooms, and bathrooms, and it was voted in without any time for public debate and adopted within weeks. This abrupt move stood in stark contrast to previous school policy considerations in which the FCSB reportedly spent 10 years debating and experimenting with school start times, conducting multiple surveys and asking for community input over the course of many months.

What occurs in Fairfax County has implications for many American public school students as the county often serves as a model district after which other locales pattern their educational best practices.

Sources say that the gender identity issue has led to increased attention from local residents and concerned parents who were either unaware of or had no time to weigh in when the measure was passed over two years ago. Many have come to school board meetings to voice their objections ever since, even if the issue is not explicitly on the agenda for the night.

Around 100 parents have complained about the board's ""betrayal of public trust"" and rapid embrace of gender ideology and their concerns with the sex education curriculum at these meetings. The parents often begin by first speaking to an issue that is on the agenda and then creatively pivoting to their concerns in order to voice them. This is reportedly a source of great embarrassment to the school board which does not want to revisit the matter.

The school board has repeatedly said that nothing will substantively change and thus far no regulations pertaining to gender identity have been issued; draft regulations were tabled in July of 2016 even as the 2015 policy remains in effect.

As The Daily Signal reported in March 2017, in Fairfax a mere 10 parents have three minutes each during public comment time to present their views to the county school board each meeting and ""[e]arning one of these coveted slots is like buying concert tickets: You get up early on the Monday before the meeting and click frantically, hoping to be among the first 10 when the school board opens its sign-up line.""

If no concerned parent manages to acquire one of the 10 coveted speaking slots on a night where policy changes about gender identity might be considered and everyone who does get to speak voices support, the illusion will be created that open public debate has occurred and that the general population is broadly behind this when the reverse is true. By tightly controlling the agenda to circumvent controversial topics once their agenda has gained sufficient ground, the public process changes can then be used to squash any opposing voices.

The proposed procedural moves would tighten what can be discussed and ""the school board can block any speakers in the future who might want to try to retroactively address items in the past because they were never given the chance due to sign up to speak [restriction], due to manipulation,"" which amounts to censorship, parents said to CP.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/parents-warn-virginia-school-district-may-ban-public-comment-opposing-gender-identity-policy-214710/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
1770,2013,"Christianity 'Patently Persisting,' Not Shrinking in US, Unlike Other Developed Nations: Study","(Photo: Reuters) Church

New research from Harvard University shows that despite the dominant narratives about American Christianity's shrinking numbers, Christian faith is actually strengthening in the United States.

The study, which was published late last year and titled ""The Persistent and Exceptional Intensity of American Religion: A Response to Recent Research"" tested the ""secularization thesis"" — the idea that the United States, like other advanced economies in the world, has dispensed with their once active culture of religious faith. Researchers Landon Schnabel of Indiana University and Sean Bock of Harvard found that the U.S. ""remains an exceptional outlier and potential counter example"" to that thesis.

And the reason for this is because of the degree of seriousness and the particular kind of faith that Americans believe and practice.

The Federalist noted Monday that mainline Protestant churches are indeed declining rapidly but that does not mean people are abandoning faith altogether; they are going somewhere else, often more distinctly evangelical congregations.

""Because of this shifting, other very different kinds of churches are holding strong in crowds and have been for as long as such data has been collected. In some ways, they are even growing. This is what this new research has found.""

For the past 50 years, the percentage of Americans who pray every day, attend church once a week or more, and who believe the Bible to be reliable and bring it to bear on their lives has remained steady, patently persisting to this very day. The United States stands in stark contrast with respect to faith in that approximately one in three Americans prays multiple times a day, whereas only one in 15 does in other comparable nations on average.

One in three Americans also believes that the Bible is God's Word. Less than 1 in 10 in other industrial nations on average believes the same. Americans attend religious services at rates that are twice as high as the next highest-attending industrial country, and three times higher than the average comparable country, the researchers found.

Meanwhile, other polling organizations have reported findings that supplement the idea that despite much talk in recent years, American Christianity is not shrinking. Pew noted in 2015 that nondenominational evangelical churches are growing significantly and that black Protestant churches have remained mostly stable and have even seen an uptick.

Considerable media attention has been paid to young people — millennials in particular — who are leaving church in supposedly sky-high numbers but even that requires deeper analysis.

Among the young adults who left their faith, only 11 percent said they had strong faith during their childhood whereas 89 percent recounted they hailed from a home where faith was weak in belief and practice, according to Pew.

Schnabel and Bock's research coheres with other recent findings from distinguished scholars at Baylor University.

J. Gordon Melton, a professor of American religious history at the Waco, Texas, school contended in November 2015 that ""[w]hile some churches have lost membership over the last 65 years, simultaneously, hundreds of new denominations have been founded, and while population has more than doubled, church membership has more than quadrupled.""

""It is still in an upward trajectory.""

Among the most talked-about demographics in polling focused on religious viewpoints and identification are the ""nones"" — those who do not identify with any particular religious tradition whatsoever. Melton argued it is a mistake to equate them with the irreligious.

""That's not the case,"" he asserted.

""We have a large segment of the 'nones' who are atheists and irreligious, but we have a large segment that fall into spiritual but not religious category ... The largest group are ones who say Christianity is not a religion.""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/christianity-patently-persisting-not-shrinking-in-us-unlike-other-developed-nations-study-214840/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
1773,2017,"Kenneth Copeland Acquires New Gulfstream V Jet, Seeks $19.5M for Upgrades and Maintenance","(Photo: Kenneth Copeland Ministries) Televangelist Kenneth Copeland and his new Gulfstream V jet.

Thanks to the support of his deep-pocketed partners, Texas-based televangelist Kenneth Copeland of Kenneth Copeland Ministries has acquired a new multimillion dollar Gulfstream V jet that he says will help him do the Lord's work and help him avoid having to contend with ""demons"" that travel on commercial airlines.

Copeland's ministry announced last Friday the acquisition of the ""debt free"" jet, which hit the market with a $36 million price tag in 1998. The ultra-long-range business jet can accommodate up to four crew members and 14 passengers in an executive configuration, according to Gulfstream. It is unclear how much Copeland's ministry paid for the jet but AV Buyer says they currently have the lowest priced Gulfstream V on the market priced at just under $6 million.

""Father we thank you so and I'm asking you now sir, according to your word, bless our partners beyond measure. Yes, in the name of Jesus. For you said in 2002, 'I'm sending you new partners who are very strong financially and they will obey me. And I will increase your longtime partners and they will obey me,"" Copeland, 81, said in a prayer of thanksgiving for the new jet.

""And you will not come short. And you will not fail. And you will not lack. And you will not come behind and you will not be diminished. Praise God,"" he said of his donors.

On the December 29, 2015, television broadcast of ""Believers Voice of Victory,"" hosted by Copeland and Jesse Duplantis, the ministers explained that private jets were important to their business to help them, among other things, pray in privacy as the Lord leads and avoid unnecessary demons.

""We've got to have this! The mess that the airlines are in today. I would have to stop — I'm being very conservative — at least, 75-80, more like 90 percent of what we are doing. Because we can't get there! That's why we are on that airplane. We can talk to God!"" Copeland said.

""Now, Oral [Roberts] used to fly airlines. But even back then it got to the place where it was agitating his spiritual. People coming up to him, he had become famous, and they wanting him to pray for them and all that,"" Copeland explained. ""You can't, you can't manage that today. This dope-filled world, and get in a long tube with a bunch of demons. And it's deadly.

""I wanted to make that clear so the devil can't lie to you and say, 'See them there preachers spending all that money, just fat cats riding around.' No, we're not; we're in business,"" Copeland said.

According to Charlie Bollinger, Kenneth Copeland Ministries' partner and volunteer, ""the Holy Spirit confirmed to Brother Copeland that the Gulfstream V was the plane the Lord had set aside for KCM."" The ministry identified the seller of the jet as filmmaker Tyler Perry. The jet was purchased and ""paid in full"" during Thanksgiving week.

While the newly acquired Gulfstream V jet ""is in outstanding condition and is an exceptional value,"" Bollinger said it will need $2.5 million in upgrades to meet new FAA standards.

""So, as Elite CX Team members, we need to set our faith NOW on receiving that additional seed so that we can sow it within the next three to four months, as the upgrades are completed,"" Bollinger urged Copeland's donors.

He further noted that an additional $17 million was necessary to help maintain the new aircraft and urged donors to prepare to give that amount as well.

""Beyond the purchase of the Gulfstream V and its upgrades, remember that the overall Mission 3 goal is $17 million. By sowing the balance of those funds as the CX Team, we will be sowing toward: the construction of a new hangar, upgrading the existing runway, and purchasing special GV maintenance equipment,"" he said.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/kenneth-copeland-acquires-new-gulfstream-v-jet-seeks-19-5m-for-upgrades-and-maintenance-214408/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
1788,2033,Luis Palau Diagnosed With Stage 4 Lung Cancer,"(Screenshot: YouTube) Andrew, Luis and Kevin Palau give a health update, January 18, 2018.

Kevin, Andrew, and Luis Palau all stood together on Thursday to make the shocking announcement that beloved world-renowned evangelist Luis Palau was diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer.

""We wanted to tape this video to tell the whole world that love dad and the work that we do what's been going on in dad's life,"" Kevin, president of Luis Palau Ministries, said in the social media video posted Thursday.

He then proceeded to share that his father fell ill after a busy fall season, as he returned from an overseas trip to the U.K. They believed he only had a chest cold but when it didn't go away the family convinced Luis to go to the doctor.

""To our surprise, the early report that we got just before Christmas [said] that there was some cancer inside one of dad's lungs,"" Kevin explained.

They got extra testing done and went to an oncologist who revealed the terminal diagnosis.

""Just a few days ago we got the word that it's stage 4 lung cancer. That's a shock, especially with someone who's always been as healthy as dad,"" he continued.

The son said they made the video so that people can join them in prayer. Luis then shared his heart concerning everything.

""I haven't been in a hospital one night except for when I broke a bone back in 1984 after missions from London,"" the esteemed Argentinian evangelist shared.

""To me, the first thing you do is cry. I think 'oh wow, I can be gone in a few months' and one silly thought that came to mind is that I won't be able to pick up the phone and talk to the boys and hear their voice and talk to my wife,"" Luis emotionally shared.

""This is sad, I don't feel panic or horror, if [I'm] healed, hallelujah! And many people are praying that the Lord will do a miracle. It would take literally a miracle medically speaking. Stage 4 is big time.""

He went on to say that the peace he felt immediately was that at least 10 years ago he elected his son, Kevin, to be president of the ministry and Andrew is an anointed evangelist.

""So everything is ready and if the Lord wants to take me home in the next two months or two years, then I'm ready,"" the loving father maintained as his sons looked at him with heartbroken smiles.

Luis said he's going to continue living one day at a time and despite the sad prognosis he still feels good.

He shared the scripture that has been keeping him encouraged: Isaiah 41:10, which says, ""Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my victorious righteous right arm.""

""I know the Lord is with me, by the Holy Spirit indwelling, He is with us, we go through it, we go into the presence of the lord,"" Luis testified.

He also shared 2 Timothy 4 where the apostle Paul says, ""the time for my departure is here.""

The 83-year-old began to cry as he thought about leaving his family but he did say he still intends to complete the mission trips they have planned throughout the world for this year as God gives him the strength.

""Thank you for your prayers, thank you for loving us, thank you for your support,"" Luis said as he ended his portion.

Andrew concluded the video by saying that he's had many restless nights the past couple of days.

""I got up and read my Proverbs early and couldn't wait to come up and see your face,"" he told his dad.

He then quoted Proverbs 15, which says, ""The evidence of a happy heart is a cheerful face.""

""To think that you're facing what you're facing and day by day we see your happy face, it's proof that you're at peace,"" Andrew stated.

""We beg you to pray for dad and mom,"" he asked viewers.

Luis has been in ministry for more than 50 years. The Palau Association has collaborated with thousands of churches in hundreds of cities around the world in his life to this point. He's made an impact in top global cities: London, Hong Kong, Singapore, Chicago, Moscow, Madrid, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Washington, D.C., and more.

This reporter was in attendance in 2015 as he rallied 1,000 New York City churches together to make history in the Big Apple. It was one of the biggest evangelical moves in New York City as approximately 60,000 people gathered to hear the Gospel and worship. The Palau Association has coordinated hundreds of citywide campaigns just like it in dozens of nations, including major evangelistic festivals on all five continents.

Evangelist Nick Vujicic said he was blown away by what he saw at the Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C., and is urging everyone, including nonbelievers, to see what it has to offer.

""As an evangelist who has been able to go to 68 countries and share the Gospel of Jesus Christ to millions of people, I tell you, I've never had an experience [like] seeing such enriching history, gaining knowledge, and appreciation of all the brothers and sisters who have gone before us, who have charged opposition and seen God's will be done on earth,"" Vujicic said in a Facebook video Saturday.

""Seeing the African-American church rise in America, and the history of the Jewish people, and seeing how the Old and New Testament come to life in such an incredible way, I'm telling you right now if I had arms and legs, I would not be able to feel my legs,"" he joked.

""It's a must see, it brings God's word to life, and you will walk away in awe.""

The preacher, who was born without arms and legs, and has gone on to become an author and speaker whose speeches inspire millions around the world, said that he can't even think of what to compare seeing the Museum of the Bible with.

He insisted that it is a ""must-see"" for any church, youth group, and the entire family.

""Even if you are a nonbeliever, you can really appreciate the historical enrichment and value of the Judeo-Christian values that many successful countries are founded upon, obviously America is one of them,"" he said.

The Washington, D.C., site has received high praise from other Christian authors as well, including Kathleen Cooke, co-founder of Cooke Pictures and The Influence Lab.

""From the moment you step into the grand entrance with its impressive 140-foot video ceiling, visitors will know they are in a truly special place unlike any other museum in the world,"" Cooke wrote in an op-ed published in The Christian Post in November.

""The MOTB is a must-see and an experience of a lifetime that you will never forget — just as the Bible is a must-read for a significant life,"" she added.

Before its launch in November, the museum did face criticism from some media outlets, such as The Washington Post, who claimed that despite the tens of thousands of Biblical texts and artifacts on show, the experience is light on the Gospel of Christ.

Steven Bickley, Museum of the Bible's vice president of marketing, administration and finance, responded to CP at the time and said:

""The forthcoming Museum of the Bible is nonsectarian and invites everyone to engage with the history, narrative and impact of the best-selling book of all time.""

Bickley added: ""It's no surprise a museum about the world's most controversial book would inspire passionate conversations even before it is complete, which is why we invite the world to see Museum of the Bible for themselves when it opens to the public Nov. 18, 2017.""

In an earlier video, Vujicic explained why he is not an atheist, claiming to have seen both miracles and demons.

""I've seen 10-foot-tall demons, 5-foot-wide walk in through my San Francisco hotel room. And I felt the demon's presence, the demonic presence, before the demon actually walked through the wall,"" the evangelist said.

He added that the existence of things like voodoo and witchcraft, which he said are real, are also something that science can't explain.

""There is a spiritual realm,"" he stated.

""You have to walk by faith despite what you see, despite what you feel — you believe it.""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/limbless-evangelist-nick-vujicic-blown-away-by-museum-of-the-bible-wants-nonbelievers-to-see-it-214673/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
1791,2036,Woman Threatens Daughter in Church With 'Blood of Jesus' and Death From God for Accusing Boyfriend of Rape,"(Screenshots: Facebook) Confessed rape survivor Sophia Lawrence (L) is rebuked by her mother (R).

Sophia Lawrence's mother sat quietly in the front row of her small church and listened in silence with other congregants as her daughter testified how she was raped at just 8 years old. When her daughter told the church who her abuser was, however, Lawrence's mother exploded from her seat and threatened her child with death from God and the ""blood of Jesus.""

""The devil! My God! God will kill you for that!"" Lawrence's mother screamed with a thick Jamaican accent.

""I was raped at 8-and-a-half years old. I kept it to myself because I didn't know who to trust....I was 8-and-a-half when my mother's boyfriend took my childhood away from me but God,"" Lawrence said, explaining she wanted to talk about what happened to bring awareness about the effects of rape in the church.

The emotional confession was recorded in a video shared by entertainment website MediaTakeout on Monday.

""The blood of Jesus is against you,"" Lawrence's mother continued to scream at her daughter as she defiantly tried to continue her testimony in which she alleged that her mother is also a rape survivor.

""My mother knew about it. My mom came to me two days ago. My mom was raped. It's not that, I'm bringing awareness,"" Lawrence continued.

As the church service devolved into a scene of shock and denial, the pastor of the church took the microphone from Lawrence's hand and several church sisters moved in to end the testimony and quiet her mother.

Her upset mother continue screaming in protest: ""No, no, no! The blood of Jesus. She is lying. And the blood of Jesus against you.""

The mayhem continued until the pastor told the church, ""We're dismissed,"" near the end of the video.

The clip has since gone viral with nearly one million views and sparked a huge debate about how the church responds to uncomfortable testimonies for the second time in a month.

Earlier this month, another church was criticized for abruptly ending the testimony of an ex-prostitute at a New Year's Eve service.

Pastor Jamal Bryant of Baltimore's Empowerment Temple church said of the way the ex-prostitute was dismissed: ""So the saints could not handle the testimony because you shouldn't say that in church. I shouldn't say what He delivered me from because my testimony is too raw and too real for the saints who watch fights on 'Love and Hip Hop.' You don't want to hear what God has done, you just want to hear what He is doing. Stop treating church like Disney World — that everybody's testimony got to be pretty and polished. And understand that some testimonies are ugly, nasty, vile, dirty, but that's the wonder-working power of His grace. The wonder-working power of His love.""

The name of the church in the latest video appears to be Agape Life based on screen displays but its location was not immediately known. The Christian Post was unable to verify what happened after the woman's testimony was abruptly ended.

Many people do not appear to agree with the way in which the church handled the testimony based on the most popular reactions to the video.

""This is so common in many households where mothers turn a blind eye to sexual abuse because they fear being alone. I am proud of this woman and she needs to remove herself from that s***hole of a church,"" wrote Claros Agnatic Morean in a comment that has garnered more than 1,000 reactions.

""I don't need to know her. I grew up and live in the Caribbean in a Caribbean household,"" wrote Eboni Brandon of Lawrence. ""This s*** happens and our families act blind, deaf and dumb and would rather not deal with it. And this doesn't just happen in homes where mothers are turning a blind eye for a buck from a man. It happens in respected middle class homes like the one I grew up in where it's better to hush the whole thing up to avoid scandal. I don't take back a damn word of what I said. In the Caribbean if it didn't happen to you, it sure as hell happened to someone you knew.""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/woman-threatens-daughter-in-church-with-blood-of-jesus-and-death-from-god-for-accusing-boyfriend-of-rape-214832/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
1792,2037,"Pastor Chris Conlee Blasts 'Hateful' Bloggers, Critics of Andy Savage in Sexual Assault Case","(Screenshot: YouTube) Chris Conlee, lead pastor of Highpoint Church in Memphis, Tennessee.

A week after Teaching Pastor Andy Savage of Highpoint Church in Memphis, Tennessee, took a leave of absence over a ""sexual incident"" with a 17-year-old former parishioner that occurred 20 years ago in Texas, Highpoint Lead Pastor Chris Conlee denounced bloggers who have been critical.

""What happened 20 years ago was wrong. What is happening with bloggers and social media critics being so hateful is also wrong,"" Conlee told his congregation Sunday about church sexual assault advocates who have been criticizing the way Savage's past was kept secret from his congregation.

Savage's accuser, Jules Woodson, revealed in a report highlighted in The Wartburg Watch earlier this month, how he coerced her into performing oral sex on him while he was her then 22-year-old youth pastor at Woodlands Parkway Baptist Church, now known as StoneBridge Church 20 years ago.

She alleged that even though he was fired from the church over the incident, what he did was not fully disclosed and she was told by church officials to keep quiet about what had happened to her. Months later, Savage was back in ministry in Memphis and his past was shared with only a few people, including Conlee.

Savage has since argued of his encounter with Woodson that ""I did not force anything. I did not ask for anything. I did not request anything. This was a very mutual organic moment that we shared.""

Since The Wartburg Watch's initial report, many critics have suggested that Savage should not be in a leadership position with his past.

Conlee has defended Savage, saying he has ""total confidence in the redemptive process Andy went through under his leadership in Texas"" and that he's ""100 percent committed"" to Savage and his continued ministry at Highpoint.

In his latest comments on Sunday, Conlee dismissed some sources of information as ""unreliable.""

""So let me ask you this question: Why is Bible reading so selective? Matthew 7:2 says this: 'For in the way you judge, you will be judged, and by your standard of measure, it will be measured to you. 'And so what I would ask for us to be a people to do, is it is okay for us to acknowledge when wrong has existed, but it's also okay for us to acknowledge that there are some sources in life that are not reliable or responsible. It is okay for us to respectfully disagree, and that's what we're doing,"" Conlee said.

""If you were watching a movie right now of this story, and in this particular movie we happen to be the main characters, what would you want us to do? Do you want us to compromise and cave in to the critics? Do you want us to quit? See, that's what the enemy wants,"" he told the church, noting that he intended to respond to the crisis in the way Jesus would.

""What you want us to do is to be people of incredible integrity, you want us to be people who are sold out, committed, to doing everything we possibly can to respond the way Jesus would respond, to speak truth in love, to have that perfect balance and tension that exists there.

""Here's what I want you to know: As your leader, as your pastor, I am committed to fighting the good fight. But watch this — don't get mistaken about the word fight — I'm committed to fighting the good fight, in the right way, at the right time, with the right heartbeat. Okay?"" he said.

He then urged his congregants to be mindful of the devil while quoting 1 Peter 5:8.

""Be sober-minded. Be watchful. Your adversary, the Devil, prowls around — watch this — like, like a roaring lion. He is not a roaring lion. He is like a roaring lion. There is only one roaring lion, and that is the lion of the tribe of Judah,"" Conlee said. ""You know what he does? He imitates in order to intimidate. Seeking someone to devour, resist him firm in your faith ....""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/pastor-chris-conlee-blasts-hateful-bloggers-critics-of-andy-savage-in-sexual-assault-case-214834/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
1793,2038,Members Turned Away From Church as Congregants Push to Dismiss Pastor Accused of Misusing Church Funds,"Expand | Collapse (Photo: Facebook) Pastor Cameron McDonald and his wife Erica of Southern Acres Christian Church in Lexington, Kentucky.

Several members of the Southern Acres Christian Church in Lexington, Kentucky, who have been lobbying to remove the pastor over allegations of financial impropriety and abuse of power, were turned away from the church Sunday to avoid ""disruption"" in the house of God.

Southern Acres member Chance Staley told WYKT that he and other members of the church were blocked by a police officer from attending the church on Sunday.

""As I approached the church the officer greeted me, Officer White, and he was very kind. He just said I wasn't welcome here and if I chose to stay I would be charged with criminal trespassing and arrested,"" Staley said.

The move comes after two Southern Acres Christian Church members alleged in a lawsuit last November that Pastor Cameron McDonald mismanaged church funds, according to the Lexington Herald Leader.

Concerned church members James Keogh and Chad Martin filed the lawsuit to prevent McDonald and his wife, Erica, from spending church money or making any real estate transfers. They alleged that he concentrated power and financial authority among himself, his wife and another staffer.

McDonald, who took over the church in 2006, was allegedly able to acquire power by dissolving a larger governing board, altering the church's operating rules and getting rid of the need for churchwide approval votes on changes.

The suit alleged that a majority of church staff members were either fired or quit as a result of the changes.

On Friday, the lawsuit was dismissed in court because the members felt it was ""a matter the church's congregation must decide internally, prayerfully and peacefully,"" according to attorney for the members Joe Bilby.

""At least 54 members of the congregation believe Southern Acres needs a fresh start with new leadership,"" Bilby said, noting that a letter bearing their names was delivered to the general congregation on Friday. In 2006, the church had 1,000 members. It is unclear how many members remain.

Staley said a number of those 54 members were blocked from attending church on Sunday.

""It's disgusting,"" Staley told the Lexington Herald Leader Monday about being turned away from his church. ""Anyone who has ever gone to a church has heard the lines, 'you are welcome; come as you are.' Even a nonbeliever knows that. To be told, 'you are not welcomed here' ... They are creating an exclusive club ... and this is not of the Christian moral values.""

Austin Wilkerson, the church's attorney, told WKYT that they were forced to block the members from attending church as a precaution because ""there were indications that there was going to be a disruption"" on Sunday.

""We're very well aware there's a lot of people who need to be heard and that there's deep reconciliation needed and the church is very happy to have the opportunity to do that,"" he said.

Bilby explained, ""The full congregation will have an opportunity to vote for a change in leadership on Feb. 4.""

Wilkerson further noted that an independent financial review is underway, which he believes will clear McDonald's name.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/members-turned-away-from-church-as-congregants-push-to-dismiss-pastor-accused-of-misusing-church-funds-214842/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

""I'm a seminary student at an orthodox but interdenominational school in the United States. I share your complementarian understanding of God's design for male and female roles and relationships in the home and church,"" wrote Scott.

""On that basis, I have recently doubted whether or not my seminary ought to allow women to teach pastors in training. What do you think? Should women be hired as seminary professors? What is your best case?""

Piper responded that he was working on the assumption that the Bible teaches the Church must be led by ""spiritual, humble, biblically qualified men,"" referencing 1st Timothy 2:12, which reads: ""I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet.""

""Just to be clear, the issue is not whether women should attend seminary in one of its programs and get the best biblical grounding possible,"" noted Piper. ""The issue is whether women should be models, mentors, and teachers for those preparing for a role that is biblically designed for spiritual men. That's the way I'm posing the question.""

Piper stressed that the issue was ""not the competence of women teachers or intelligence or knowledge or pedagogical skill,"" but rather ""the nature of the seminary teaching office.""

""If it is unbiblical to have women as pastors, how can it be biblical to have women who function in formal teaching and mentoring capacities to train and fit pastors for the very calling from which the mentors themselves are excluded?"" argued Piper.

""I don't think that works. The issue is always that inconsistency. If you strive to carve up teaching in such a way that it's suitable for women, it ceases to be suitable as seminary teaching.""

Piper's comments have garnered much controversy, with author and worship leader Kaitlin Curtice posting to Twitter that she was unsurprised by the response.

""This interview reminds me of one of the pastors of my childhood, a man I dearly love but who would never value me as a leader,"" tweeted Curtice. ""So we are challenged to not only try to undo this mindset, but to constantly chip away at and mend to the brokenness of its repercussions for our society.""

Curtice then called on her male followers to post examples of female church leaders who have ""contributed most to your theology through their leadership,"" to which she received many responses.

""She then put out a call to action for men to point out some women who have positively affected men's theology, and the responses did not disappoint, referencing women both famous and not, familial and not, who shaped them and continue to lead them,"" noted Relevant magazine.

Others on social media have come to Piper's defense, including Joe Rigney, professor at Piper's Bethlehem College & Seminary.

In a series of Tweets, Rigney argues that Piper ""reframes the generic question"" of women teaching at seminaries as seeing the goal of seminary to be practical vocational training for pastors.

""[T]he best pedagogical method for such a seminary is through modeling, mentoring, and teaching for the pastoral office by professors who are qualified to fill that office,"" said Rigney in a series of tweets.

""Specifically, profs should be actively involved as elder-qualified men in a church. This comes close to requiring that seminary profs actually be elders without actually requiring it (thus allowing for profs whose life situation precludes serving as an elder at any given time).""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/john-piper-ignites-debate-saying-only-men-should-teach-seminaries-214996/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
1796,2041,Urbana Director: Why Following God's Calling Doesn't Just Mean a Missions Trip,"(Photo: InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA) Urbana 2015 missions conference held in St. Louis, Missouri December 27–31, 2015.

College students often get a bad rap when it comes to their faith. They're often cited as the age group that leaves the church in droves or is less religious overall. But the director of one of the largest Christian student missions conferences wants to clarify some things.

Ruth Hubbard is the director of Urbana 2018. Since 1946, this global event led by InterVarsity has drawn some 300,000 people, mainly college students. She recognizes that students who are around 18 or 19 years old start ""asking a lot of hard questions about the faith of their parents and grandparents, where they are wondering 'are all the things that their parents and grandparents held as being part of the faith really what God intended?'""

But that's natural, Hubbard told The Christian Post.

""College is an age where most of us begin to say, 'I need to push away from what my parents have always taught me, and analyze it for myself.' There is a natural kind of skepticism or questioning that is true for younger adults,"" she said.

And while many students do reject the Christian faith, or at least some aspects of it, Hubbard clarified that a lot of times what they're rejecting is not Christianity, per se.

""Many of us have the tendency to take the culture in which we live and the faith that we hold to, and merge those things together,"" she explained. ""I think that has been particularly true for the West, and for a majority of cultures.""

Thus, what the young generation is rejecting is ""not necessarily the God of the Bible, but rather this sort of mushed-up faith expression,"" where young people go, ""I think some of that has nothing to do with God.""

Notably, Hubbard said that Urbana conferences have not seen any ""dramatic drop in attendance."" The most recent one, held in 2015, drew nearly 16,000 people. Any decrease in numbers they see is not due to a lack of interest among youths in spiritual matters, but rather ""the fact that there are more conferences that students can choose from"" now, the director noted.

Helping Students Find Their Calling

The next Urbana conference will be held in St. Louis, Missouri, in December. The main mission of Urbana is to ""call generations to surrender to Christ's lordship"" and to help students find their calling and join ""the Lord's global mission whether across campus, zip codes, or the world.""

Hubbard first attended Urbana in 2000. It was at that conference that she felt led to spend the next 14 years of her life serving at Wycliffe Bible Translators, which promotes literacy and helps people around the world translate the Word of God into their own languages.

When it comes to inspiring students to find their calling, sometimes the Gospel can be oversimplified to being ""only about telling people about Jesus so they can be saved, go to Heaven and live happily ever after,"" she pointed out. But more than that, it's about living out the Gospel in every aspect of their lives.

Hubbard referred to the book of Matthew, where Jesus taught believers to pray ""Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done,"" and said people need to consider what that looks like in their lives.

""The Kingdom of God has come to me personally and it impacts the way I personally live, it impacts us as a community,"" she said. ""He impacts the way we live as a Church, and so that living out of the Gospel is going to be different.

""That's what we want to invite students to do, not to say 'go be seekers of justice' or 'go be seekers of compassion, make sure people are fed,' or 'go be conveyors of this message,' or 'go build the church;' but rather, 'know God, know Him deeply, know Him well, know His Word, become so engaged with Him in a relationship and with the community of people who know and love Him that the living out of every aspect of our lives is saturated with that relationship.'""

For the younger generation, social justice causes such as sex trafficking or child poverty are often attractive. And while ""doing good is good,"" Hubbard warned against following their own sense of justice versus aligning themselves to God's plan.

""When we venture out with our own energies, with our own passion, anything we try to accomplish on our own, even for the good, can get so easily derailed,"" Hubbard said.

""It's not like doing good is a bad thing. Doing good is good! Let's make the world a better place, let's do that. But when we do it and it's not aligned with what God is doing, what God intended, what God teaches clearly in His Scripture, it can become less helpful than if we are paying attention to what God is calling us to do.""

The Urbana director insisted that justice is the way that God designed things to be.

""There is a sense of God's justness in the world, and they will invest themselves in that,"" she said of young people.

""And if they are doing that walking with God, following after what He has called them to, that will ultimately be different and look different than when they are just going out and [following] whatever justice feels like today, and letting themselves or a generation or a fad define justice.""

Hubbard said her goal as a director at Urbana is not to have a certain number of students check the box for short-term missions trips or international internships. She wants to see real transformation in students' lives.

(Photo: InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA) Urbana 2015 missions conference held in St. Louis, Missouri December 27–31, 2015.

""My highest goal is that they can see more clearly than ever Jesus, the slain lamb on God's eternal throne, as their Savior and their Lord and their God, as all that God is to them, and from that they will be moved to a life of worship, and a life of service that brings the Kingdom,"" she said.

In the meantime, she hopes students can begin living out the Gospel now in their own context, rather than wait for an overseas opportunity.

""They need to realize that it doesn't make sense that God would call them to be an evangelist across an ocean if they are not bearing witness to who God is in their own communities,"" she pointed out.

""I don't think God is going to turn you into a missionary if you are not already thinking about 'How do I talk about God in the communities I am in?' If you are not caring for the poor in your own community, how are you going to go and suddenly care about the poor somewhere else?"" Hubbard posed.

""One of the ways in which you prepare for a lifetime of service is to begin doing service now. Inviting students to think about how they can do service outside their own communities, and for some that means reaching into international student ministries that might be on their campuses, or engaging in ministry with those who have come to their campus.

""Allowing God to work in you so that when the opportunity comes, you have already been engaging, and it will be a natural, logical step to move into the next stage,"" she said of answering the call for missions.

Below, Hubbard answers CP's questions on the mission field, how to reach people for Christ, and the influence of technology on missions. She also recounts an intriguing story she heard while she served at Wycliffe. Answers edited for clarity.

CP: Is the missions field changing? Is the West coming more into focus with the rise of secularism?

Hubbard: God has invited us to bear witness to who He is and what He has done everywhere we go. I want to be careful and not slip into the thinking that everyone is a missionary everywhere they go. I think there is a unique role for the person who leaves their own community and crosses cultures and serves. I think there is something about that that is a part of God's plan. But we also know that God has called all of us to bear witness to who He is and what He has been doing in our lives.

Wherever there is a lack of witness, wherever there is darkness, we are called to bring light. We know that darkness takes on various characteristics. In some places, there is a darkness that comes mostly from ignorance, and in other places there may be a darkness that comes mostly from rebellion and rejection.

The way in which you may carry light in those places — the strategies may differ, but there is also the fact that light is light, and what we do is we reflect the light of God. God's light is already in those places, and we come and serve as a reflector of that light.

However, it is that God created us to be this way, we often see Him in the lives of human beings around us, when we might have missed Him if it wasn't for them.

There are places on Earth where there is not a witness to God, or the witness to God is very small, it is a little, tiny flickery flame. Missions, strategies in those places is going to look very different than places where there has been a brilliant light in some points in history that has then been corrupted, or neglected, or ignored, or all the things that might happen in societies that we may call post-Christian.

I think there is great room to grow in the missions field. I have asked the question recently as the church is growing in China, and there is an increased fervor among Chinese Christians for global missions, ""what does it look like for Chinese Christian university students to come and spread the Gospel in the universities in the United States?""

We know that it's no longer ""from the West to the rest,"" it's the whole Church taking the whole Gospel to the whole world.

CP: Is it more difficult to reach people for Christ in the secular world?

Hubbard: I haven't done extensive study or reading, and so this is a somewhat informed but not as informed as it might be though, [but] I don't know if I would characterize it as more difficult.

(Photo: InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA) Urbana 2015 missions conference held in St. Louis, Missouri December 27–31, 2015.

Where I think we would find difficulty in any Gospel ministry, in any of the ways where we would bear witness and call people to follow Jesus, or any place where we do evangelistic kind of work, is when there is opposition. [For instance] from a secular viewpoint that no longer wants to listen, and we know that that is the experience of some. In the United States and in the West, there is a sense of ""all the voices should have a chance to speak except for the Christian voice"" — that's the one voice that's not welcome in pluralism.

So there is opposition there; there is opposition from other religions across the world; there could be opposition that is more political. [In] any kind of opposition there is challenge — that has not changed throughout all of human history.

Where we find perhaps ourselves saying ""its harder here or it's harder there"" is when there is a kind of challenge that we are not adjusted to address. If I try to take the strategy of sharing the Gospel that worked somewhere within a specific community, or a generation, or a context, and I don't adapt it at all and take it to another place where it may not work at all, and I go ""Oh, it might be so much harder to share the Gospel"" — it might not be that it's harder, it might be that it requires a different way to do that.

We may need to apply what we've learned in other places, and see ""well, how does that apply here? How do we conceptualize the Gospel for this community, for this generation; and not allow what appears to be opposition to derail us?"" There has always been opposition to the Gospel.

CP: What are some trends or developments in technology in missions that the general public might be surprised by?

Hubbard: The general public probably won't be surprised that the use of technology in missions is growing exponentially. They might be surprised at the kind of things that technology has impacted. [There are] people who think ""let's think creatively, let's go outside of our boxes, and not just try to do what we've always done and use technology to make it better.""

We (older generations) are still thinking in terms of documentation, where as a digital native, which is the younger generation, they are going to come in and turn it all sideways and say, ""Why does it have to look like that at all?""

For instance, I came from the world of Bible translation, [where young people] have led to changes.

[For example], in an oral culture, instead of trying to create a writing system and then translate using it, they are translating orally and then creating a writing system where a community sees that to be a positive thing for them to have.

With technology, where a person can listen to Scripture in a language that they know, other than their own heart language, they can listen to it multiple times, and then speak it back, and then you can have someone else listen to it and do the same. And it can all be done digitally with oral recordings.

So that [is a] kind of a switch in how we think about technology, and I think that is going to be led by a generation that lives inside the digital world, as they are not tied to other ways of doing things.

CP: Are there memories you can share that really stand out to you where you've seen missions work inspire or lead people to change their lives?

Hubbard: I am reminded of a story — so the man's name is Leonard, and he's Cameroonian.

He was participating in the work, he was doing the work of translating Scripture into the language that serves him and his community best. He was using the French scriptures, and had access to English scriptures.

He was invited to read Scripture during Holy Week at their church service. So he read the story of Jesus' death and resurrection, and there was a group of women in the congregation that approached him after the service, and they were clearly emotional.

There was actually quite the response from the whole group that was gathered, that started with people becoming silent as he began to read.

The community was so used to Scripture being read in French (which they only barely understood), but when he began to read Scripture in a language they spoke, there was a silence, and there was an emotional response from the people.

And the women who came up to him afterwards (they would have called themselves Christians), they said ""where did you get this story?"" They were almost accusing him of conjuring up some kind of story that they had never heard before.

He pulled out his French New Testament and said, ""It's in here, you hear this story every year during these services."" [But they replied] ""No, we've never heard this story before, we never knew this.""

And it became to be very transformational for these specific women, but also for the community as a whole.

I've heard stories like that over and over again as it relates to Scripture being available in the language that serves people best. It moves them into a life of service, which is very different [from] when it is just sort of, ""I'm going to take on this religion;"" it moves from religion to a deep relationship.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/urbana-director-why-following-gods-calling-missions-trip-212940/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
1813,2061,"Ed Young Tackles Family Dysfunction, Personal Baggage in 'Adult Children' Sermon Series","(Screenshot: YouTube/Ed Young) Ed Young, Fellowship Church of Grapevine, Texas pastor, delivering the first part of his sermon series ""Adult Children"" on Sunday, January 14, 2018. The automobile behind him with baggage tied on top represented the personal baggage people carry around with them.

Ed Young, lead pastor of Fellowship Church in Grapevine, Texas, is tackling the problem of personal baggage from dysfunction and abuse in a new sermon series titled ""Adult Children.""

Young is covering issues like divorce, addiction, and family dysfunction in the series, which kicked off last week and had its latest installment on Sunday.

""Divorce. Addiction. Dysfunction. Abuse. We live in a broken world and because of that, we are either experiencing one of these issues or we know someone who is,"" explains Fellowship Church's website.

""In this series of talks by Ed Young, we will discover what the Bible has to say about these issues, and that ultimately there is value in and victory over our struggles and that hope can arise from heartache.""

To illustrate his point, for his first installment of the series, delivered on Jan. 14, Young drove an SUV onto the stage of Fellowship, complete with several bags and suitcases tied to the top.

He recalled his experiences overseeing a family vacation to SeaWorld when his sons and daughters were children. Upon their return, he forgot about the luggage on top of the car and drove straight into the garage, destroying the top of his garage.

The automobile behind him included baggage tied on top, representing the personal baggage people carry around with them.

""A lot of us here have some serious family baggage. We're carrying around a lot of baggage on top of our lives. Yet, most of us are unaware that we have the baggage. We're just sort of used to it,"" explained Young.

""We think it's 'normal.' We think it's 'healthy.' Yet, if we stop and look, we see the carnage, we see the destruction that the baggage is causing and also we're discovering if we really take a look at our lives that its expensive.""

What kind of baggage are people carrying? Anxiety, anger, lack of forgiveness, promiscuity, trust issues, and guilt, among other things, Young explained. Many people grow up experiencing that baggage in their households and later end up displaying that same anxiety, anger, promiscuity and guilt.

""Maybe you grew up in the family of a divorce situation, alcohol, drugs, narcissism, maybe you grew up with some sort of abuse,"" he told the congregation. In such families, young girls and boys may end up seeking love and intimacy elsewhere and find themselves having sex with the first person who sends a suggestive text or reaches out to them, Young noted.

""And then you have confusion in these families where maybe you have an absentee father or mother, you have homosexuality, addiction to porn, lust. I think we see it played out all the time. If you look at how many couples are living together now, I understand it. I get it. 'I'm not going to repeat what I saw in my family. My parents hated each other, they divorced. I'm not going to do that. I'm going to test drive this girl ... this guy [before] we get married.""

Young explained that the inspiration for the ""Adult Children"" series was the Bible passage of Isaiah 57:18-19, which reads: ""I have seen how they acted, but I will heal them. I will lead them and help them, and I will comfort those who mourn. I offer peace to all, both near and far! I will heal my people.""

""We want children to act like adults and then we have adults acting like children. Why? Well, I'll tell you why. The root of our problem and the fruit of our problem goes all the way back to the origin or our family of origin,"" he said, referring to Adam and Eve.

""They're the ones who said, 'hey, I want to be God. I want to run the show.' So from there ... we've been dealing and trying to process these issues, these bags.""

During part 2 of the series, delivered on Sunday, Young spoke of the ""will-barrow,"" a play on the word ""wheelbarrow"" which in the sermon referred to an object meant to wheel someone to safety.

Young spoke about a hypothetical scenario in which a person finds themselves on a tall burning building and then, from a neighboring building, a cable is attached and a person goes over with a wheel-barrow for the rescue.

""Our great God has sent Jesus to fire the cable from God's side to man's side, He's crossed the cable, we're in a towering inferno. He's locked eyes with you and me, and He looks at us and says 'get in,'"" said Young.

""Some of us, have gotten in. Some of us have said OK, Jesus, I realize that I am on a towering inferno and I get in. Others of us, though, standing here with our baggage ... we don't comprehend our true condition.""

Young attributed this metaphorical refusal to denial, with the hypothetical person replying, ""I can take care of my situation"" and ""I don't really have dysfunction, I don't really have issues.""

He added that other factors for rejecting the ""will barrow"" include placing blame on others, being too fearful to get in, or other issues stemming from a dysfunctional upbringing.

""We use these things and we double down on our dysfunction and when we double down on our dysfunction, it brings us to our knee. Maybe you're down on one knee. Put the other knee down,"" noted Young.

""These things will bring you to the bottom. Rock bottom. And you might be saying, 'Ed, I'm at rock bottom, man. I'm sitting on the last row, the last seat in the balcony up there and I am at rock bottom.'""

Young added that this was ""good,"" because ""if you're at rock bottom, now God can build a foundation and the rock is named Jesus.""

2025,2322,Should Christians Be Vegetarians?,"Vegetarian and Vegan diets have their differences, but both agree that a daily intake of fruits and vegetables is beneficial for their practitioners.

Is it God's will that we consume a plant-based diet? Frightening blood test results from my doctor recently prompted me to ponder this question.

My triglycerides were at 961. Normal is considered less than 150. My non-HDL cholesterol was also in the ""very high"" range at 229, rather than an ""optimal"" less than 130. Since I want to be alive to meet my grandchildren someday, I decided to begin a mostly plant-based diet.

What does the Bible say?

In Genesis 9, God gives us permission to eat animals. After the flood, when God makes a covenant with Noah, He says, ""The fear and dread of you shall rest on every animal of the earth, and on every bird of the air, on everything that creeps on the ground, and on all the fish of the sea; into your hand they are delivered. Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you; and just as I gave you the green plants, I give you everything."" (Genesis 9: 2,3)

Elsewhere in the Old Testament, God provides instructions to Abraham's descendents for eating meat. Leviticus 11 and Deuteronomy 14 detail the Jewish laws for the types of meat that can and cannot be eaten. Allowed food is called ""clean"" and unallowed food is called ""unclean."" For land animals, ""whatever parts the hoof and is cloven-footed and chews the cud"" can be eaten. From the waters, animals with fins and scales can be eaten. The chapter lists animals that can't be eaten, including many types of birds, insects and reptiles, but the eating of certain meats are clearly allowed.

In the New Testament, we find Jesus and the apostles tear down the legalism of the Old Testament. ""He has abolished the law with its commandments and ordinances, that he might create in himself one new humanity in place of the two, thus making peace"" (Ephesians 2:15).

In Acts 10, Peter falls into a trance and has a vision. He sees Heaven opened and ""all kinds of four-footed creatures and reptiles and birds of the air."" A voice tells him to ""kill and eat."" After Peter declines, not wanting to disobey Jewish law, the voice reiterates, ""What God has made clean, you must not call profane."" The vision sets up a revelation for later in the chapter when Peter realizes the Gospel is for both Jews and Gentiles.

The Bible, therefore, clearly doesn't forbid the eating of meat. Yet, there is also the question of prudence. Are there good reasons for Christians to avoid eating meat even if it's allowed? An act can be not-sinful yet unwise.

Daniel 1 has an interesting story about a vegan diet. When four Jews are chosen to be part of the king's court in Babylon, they decide to not eat meat or drink wine in order to avoid breaking their dietary laws. The palace guard was concerned the king would have his head if the Jews under his care appeared malnourished. After 10 days of consuming only vegetables and water, however, ""they appeared better and fatter than all the young men who had been eating the royal rations."" Was it a miracle from God? Did God change the carrot sticks into chicken fingers on the way down? Or was a plant-based diet better for them?

Vegetarianism is a wise choice for health reasons, as my own results attest. After four months, my non-HDL cholesterol dropped from 229 to 183 and my triglycerides dropped from 961 to 181. I also lost about 10 pounds.

Many of our health problems, and our high health care costs, in the United States can be attributed to a poor diet. We eat too much fat and don't get enough fiber, mostly due to the amount of meat we consume. (We also consume too much salt and sugar, but a vegetarian diet alone won't help with that.)

The Center for Disease Control estimates that 75 percent of all health care dollars spent in the United States are to treat preventable diseases — diseases caused by our poor diet and sedentary lifestyle choices, such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer and osteoporosis. We often hear concerns about the rising costs of health care, but we can all do our part by simply eating healthier and getting more exercise.

There are also ethical concerns about U.S. livestock industries. The overuse of antibiotics by these industries will likely lead to ""superbugs."" To save money, these industries give antibiotics to all their animals, even the healthy ones. This leads to bacteria becoming resistant to the antibiotics, which then can produce antibiotic resistant germs harmful to humans. Others have raised issues with the environmental damage and the treatment of animals in the livestock industry.

The large amount of meat and dairy in American diets isn't only due to personal tastes. These industries are a classic example of an iron triangle. Their lobbyists infiltrate government agencies. Members of Congress gain campaign contributions. And the industries benefit from favoritism and taxpayer subsidies. This why you don't hear government agencies advising us to eat less meat, but you do hear them say kids should drink milk daily. So, in a sense, going vegan is a protest against government cronyism. You can be an Ayn-Rand-style hippie by avoiding animal products.

If more Christians were vegetarian, or ate a lot less animal products, therefore, we could have a positive impact on our overall health, environment, and government.

While I'm encouraging my fellow Christians to eat less meat and dairy, I don't insist one must become vegetarian to be a good Christian. As a Focus on the Family blog post on vegetarianism helpfully points out, that would smack of the type of judgmentalism proscribed by the New Testament.

""Here's the bottom line. If you and your friends feel that God is calling you to stop eating meat, all we can say is 'more power to you.' But we would encourage you to be careful about passing judgment on others who think differently. As you can see, there's a strong case to be made on almost every side of this question. The New Testament tells us again and again that believers must be tolerant towards one another when it comes to matters of this nature. It's crucial to remember that discussions of this kind are secondary to the central issue of saving faith in Jesus Christ. In the words of the apostle Paul, 'Everyone should be fully convinced in his own mind' (Romans 14:5).""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/should-christians-be-vegetarians-214290/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
2029,2326,Who Was to Blame for the Government Shutdown This Time?,"(Photo: REUTERS/Carlos Barria) U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) talks to journalist after attending the Senate Democrat party leadership elections at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, DC, U.S. November 16, 2016.

Much of the media coverage suggests that both parties were to blame for the government shutdown. That's ridiculous.

Here are the three to blame:

Chuck Schumer and the Democrats

The government shutdown was a Democrat-led effort. Senate Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer of New York, were using the filibuster rule, which requires a 60-vote threshold, to prevent passage of a government funding bill.

The senators to blame for not funding the government were the senators who voted against funding the government. On Friday, that was 42 Democrats, two independents who coalition with the Democrats, and four Republicans. (Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also voted no but for procedural reasons, so he could bring the bill back to the floor for another vote. John McCain wasn't present for the vote for health reasons.) Only five Democrats voted in favor of funding the government on Friday.

I share National Review Editor Rich Lowry's bemusement at media coverage unwilling to point out the obvious. ""It remains amazing that Democrats are attempting a shutdown that is even more audacious than Ted Cruz's — DACA not even a fiscal matter — and not getting laughed out of the room by the press,"" he wrote on Twitter.

During the 2013 government shutdown, the media had no difficulty acknowledging that Republicans, led by Sen. Ted Cruz, Texas, were to blame for the shutdown. Cruz wanted to defund Obamacare. In a quixotic attempt to get what he wanted, he led a filibuster of government funding with a minority of Republicans. Since Democrats controlled the Senate, and Obama would never sign a bill defunding his signature achievement, the effort was absurd from the start.

In the current Democrat shutdown, we also see the minority party, the party not chosen by voters to lead Congress, demanding they get something unrelated to government funding, a DACA bill, in return for funding the government.

I support DACA, a bill to provide legal status to unauthorized immigrants brought to this country as children. But I also support democracy. The notion that the minority party should decide what legislation gets passed, or even voted on, is offensive to majority rule. If Democrats want to be able to pass bills, they should win elections, not use Senate rules to undermine democracy norms.

How did we get to this point, where the party voters didn't choose to lead the Senate gets to set the agenda?

Aaron Burr

The next person to blame for the government shutdown is Vice President Aaron Burr. Despite the popular myth, the Senate was never designed to be a supermajority institution (except for approving treaties). The filibuster rule came about by accident, not design.

In 1805, Burr, in his role as president of the Senate, got rid of the ""previous question"" motion, or the rule that allowed the Senate to end debate on a bill. This was done by mistake. It was not done to allow filibusters. It would be many years later, 1837, before a senator would use Burr's mistake to impose the will of a minority on the majority.

It wasn't until 1917 that the Senate was able to add a rule to end debate (called Rule 22 or the cloture rule). But Rule 22 required a two-thirds vote to end debate, which was changed again to a three-fifths vote in 1974.

Throughout the early 20th Century, filibusters were often used to kill civil rights bills. Legislation supported by a majority of the country, such as an anti-lynching law, was prevented by the filibusters of Southern Democrats.

Since the filibuster is counter to the democratic norm of majority rule, why do Americans support it?

Jefferson Smith

The last person to blame for the government shutdown is Jefferson Smith, the fictional lead character played by Jimmy Stewart in Frank Capra's ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" (1939), perhaps the worst political film in the history of Hollywood.

In the film, Jefferson Smith is appointed to a Senate seat. When a majority of senators attempt to pass legislation Smith doesn't like, he filibusters to prevent passage of the bill.

Smith wasn't even chosen by voters. He was appointed by the governor to temporarily fill the seat until the next election. Yet, in the dramatic climax of the film, he uses the filibuster to impose his will on the duly elected majority. You would think that a happy ending would see Smith's deviant schemes fail, but Capra presents Smith's villainy as heroic.

Americans should demand that the Senate get rid of the filibuster and return to the sanity of majority rule. That wouldn't end all government shutdowns, but it would end this one, and make them less likely in the future. Instead, most Americans actually like the filibuster. I blame Jefferson Smith.

Now it's true that the Democrats' ultimate goal, the passage of DACA, is admirable, and the fictional legislation that Smith successfully killed was bad, a sort of government cronyism bill, but the ends shouldn't justify the means. Process matters. We should support good legislation, but only when done the right way.

Democracies will sometimes make bad choices. That's a bargain we must accept to live in a democracy. By supporting non-majoritarian means to pass good legislation, we undermine democracy, and that will have far worse consequences in the long term.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/who-was-to-blame-for-the-government-shutdown-this-time-214687/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
2058,2359,Chip and Joanna Gaines Having Too Many Kids? Feminist Says Population Control Worth Revisiting,"(Photo: HGTV/Fixer Upper) Fixer Upper's Chip and Joanna Gaines

HGTV's Fixer Upper stars Chip and Joanna Gaines are being irresponsible, a feminist argued, since having ""too many"" children threatens the planet. And though population control is tied to troubling things, it is worth revisiting, she suggested.

The Gaineses, who announced recently that they are expecting their fifth child in an Instagram post, were heavily criticized on social media, a response that surprised feminist writer Kristen Pyszczyk, even though she concurs with their critics.

""Procreation is becoming a global public health concern, rather than a personal decision,"" Pyszczyk asserted in a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation editorial Saturday, an article which argued that it ought not be taboo to slam people for having ""too many"" kids.

""While having a child or five is a very personal choice, it's also a choice that affects everyone who inhabits our planet. So while many people might find the backlash [against Chip and Jo Gaines] unwarranted, it's actually a conversation we need to have in order to challenge our uncritical acceptance of the life-fulfillment-through-procreation story.""

And even though population control is fraught with associations with ""nasty historical events"" and ""eugenics,"" it merits further discussion because it is ""not an exaggeration to say that the survival of our species depends on it,"" she went on to say.

Amid dire looming threats to the planet scientists like Steven Hawking warn are imminent, ""the fact that people are starting to react to those who have many children is great, but we need to go much further,"" Pyszczyk asserted.

""Women need to be presented with options for a fulfilling life that don't involve taking 20 years of their lives to care for offspring,"" she said, adding that more people should consider adopting kids.

""I get that humankind's theoretical demise is not enough to justify abstaining from what is for many the most meaningful experience of a lifetime. But it's not theoretical. Climate change is getting measurably worse, populations are multiplying exponentially and economic inequality is not getting better. And to top it off, Prince is dead. Don't bring a child into this.""

The population control narrative that children are a tax on the earth continues to reappear on the political landscape despite evidence showing its futility.

An omniscient God would not have created a planet insufficient for our human needs as the number of people increased, said Steven Mosher, president of the Population Research Institute, in a March 2017 interview with The Christian Post. And He would ""pre-deploy the resources that we would then unlock with our creative intelligence, another gift from God.""

And aside from anything theological, the PRI president added, the history of the human race has demonstrated this to be the case.

""As our numbers have grown, our well-being has grown even faster because we collectively invent solutions for the problems caused by our numbers, which leave us better off at the end of the day than when we started,"" Mosher said.

When wealthy European nations go into poor countries and essentially tell them that ""a life lived at less than $10,000 per capita is not worth living, and so, therefore, you shouldn't have children because you can't give them each their own separate bedroom and promise to pay private school tuition,"" it is a pitiful measure of the value of life, he said.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/chip-and-joanna-gaines-having-too-many-kids-feminist-says-population-control-worth-revisiting-213992/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
2059,2360,How a Former ESPN Producer Forgave His Alcoholic Dad,"Former ESPN producer Jason Romano reveals how his Christian faith led him to forgive his dad after years of alcoholism and chaos — and he offers some much-needed guidance for anyone else struggling with a loved one who has caused pain:

Forgiveness can be hard, especially when a loved one has wronged us. But, as Christians, we're commanded to offer grace to those who have hurt us…no matter what.

Of course, this is often easier said than done, as evidence in stories shared by people like former ESPN producer Jason Romano. Romano's parents divorced when he was just 6 years old, though he said his dad was ""always around.""

Eventually, though, his dad developed a problem with alcoholism — and, over the years, Romano said that it sparked scores of problems. He shares these struggles in his new book, Live to Forgive: Moving Forward When Those We Love Hurt Us.

""I remember going to the bar as a kid, and he would get me a soda and let me play the pinball machine while he was at the bar watching the game with his buddies,"" Romano told Faithwire. ""I remember things like that, but at that time, that's not abusive to me. That's just kind of a kid with a soda playing video games, you know?""

As the years wore on, though, that dynamic dramatically changed. He recalled a specific incident in 1984 when his father took him to his first NFL game between the Eagles and Giants — a moment that left him embarrassed and saddened.

""My dad was the one who took us to this game. The only memories I have from this game are terrible memories of him being drunk, him yelling and screaming and getting in fights with the fans from the Eagles, my dad was a Giants fan, and is a Giants fan,"" Romano said. ""Then the drive back and being scared in the back seat because my dad and my stepmom ... were arguing, and my dad was swerving all over the road, because he had been drinking too much. That's one of the earliest memories I have of him.""

Romano described his relationship with his dad as being somewhat of a ""rollercoaster of good and very, very bad."" While he had a good dialogue with his dad as a teen, alcoholism often got in the way.

A new survey by the Christian humanitarian charity Tearfund has found that one in five adults in Britain pray regularly, and that number is more than double the amount of people who go to church regularly.

A ComRes poll of 2,069 people, commissioned by Tearfund, showed that 20 percent of U.K. adults pray regularly, or at least once a month, but only 9 percent go to church regularly.

The survey also showed that more than half of adults, 51 percent, say they ever pray, but only one in three people pray in a place of worship. A third of them pray before going to bed or while waking up, and others pray while doing daily activities.

The survey further found that those who pray say they pray mostly for family. About 42 percent pray to thank God, 40 percent pray for friends or for healing, 37 percent pray for guidance, and 28 percent pray for themselves.

Fifty-five percent of those with no religious affiliation pray when they have a personal crisis or tragedy, 32 percent of them pray for something to change, 24 percent pray as a last resort, and 23 percent pray for comfort or when feeling lonely.

The poll found that women are more likely to say they ever pray, 56 percent, compared with men, 46 percent.

Only 24 percent pray about global poverty, according to Tearfund.

""We often pray for the work we do in 50 countries worldwide, whether in fragile states like the Central African Republic, or for climate-change issues that push many into poverty,"" The Times quoted Ruth Valerio, the charity's global advocacy director, as saying. ""We believe prayer is powerful and changes situations.""

Tearfund hopes to use the poll's results to encourage Britons to pray more about global issues.

According to data released by the Church of England last year, an average of 930,000 people, 14 percent of whom were children, attended weekly worship services during October 2016.

The smallest 25 percent of churches reported no children attended on average.

A survey commissioned by the Church of England found last year that only 6 percent of British adults are practicing Christians.

The ComRes survey found that the reported decline of Christian believers in the U.K. might be even steeper than suggested, as 55 percent of the faithful admitted they never read the Bible. Another 33 percent said they never attend church, while 29 percent said they never pray.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/only-1-in-5-brits-prays-once-a-month-double-number-who-attend-church-regularly-214019/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
2061,2362,Christian Dad Shares How Family Moved to Africa After Feds 'Sabotaged' Daughter's Adoption,"(Photo: The Christian Post / Samuel Smith ) Smooth Via gives his family's adoption testimony at annual Evangelicals for Life conference at the J.W. Marriott in Washington, D.C. on Jan. 19, 2018.

WASHINGTON — A Christian father, who along with his wife and three children, moved to Africa in 2013 after the U.S. government refused to let them bring home their newly adopted daughter from Uganda, spoke Friday what it means to act on God's convictions despite not knowing exactly what The Lord is calling for.

Jonathan ""Smooth"" Via, a pastor and missionary affiliated with the humanitarian organization Arise Africa, gave his family's testimony while speaking at the 2018 Evangelicals for Life conference at the J.W. Marriott, hosted by the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission ahead of the March for Life in the nation's capital.

Via, who proposed to his wife, Kelly, on the banks of the Nile River in 2001, has for many years had a passion for the people of Uganda and has served on many Arise Africa short-term missions there.

Although the Vias had made several mission trips to the developing country in the past, Via explained that it wasn't until they went there again for a short-term mission in 2010 that their lives would change forever.

It was that year when Arise Africa had just opened what Via referred to as a ""babies home"" in response to requests from local pastors who were looking for ways to help orphaned and at-risk children. Naturally, the Vias decided to visit the home.

""It was while we were [at the babies' home] that something changed in me. I don't have the words to put to it. But, it was like God was tearing open a hole in my heart, like he was making room for somebody who he was about to bring into our lives,"" Via told the audience. ""It was when we got back to the room that night that my wife and I began to talk about it and she felt the same way.""

Via said that it felt like God had ""drastically altered"" their entire future.

""I told [my wife] ... 'We don't get to go back and pretend like it's business as usual anymore,'"" Via recalled. ""It was several months later that we finally turned in an application with an adoption agency with the express purpose of adopting a child from Arise Africa's babies' home.""

Via explained that there were some initial setbacks that are common with adoptions from countries like Uganda. Once everything got approved through the Uganda court system for them to adopt from the babies' home, the Vias were finally able to travel to meet their new adopted daughter, Chloe, in April 2012.

(Photo: The Archibald Project) The Via family unites with their adopted daughter and sister, Chloe, for the first time in this photo from April 2012.

The Vias believed it would only be a matter of weeks before they would be able to return home to the U.S. with their new adopted daughter.

However, God had ""something completely different in mind,"" Via explained.

""It was immediately after that date that it began to feel like everything was falling apart,"" Via emotionally said.

Although the Vias made it through the Uganda court system and were named her legal guardians in May 2012, the situation took a turn for the worst after the Vias applied for a visa for Chloe through the U.S. Embassy.

""For reasons unbeknownst to us, we don't know entirely what happened, but I do know for sure that the consular who was adjudicating our case for some reason became convinced that something unethical or something sketchy had happened in the process of our adoption,"" Via said. ""She set out from that point forward to sabotage our adoption.""

""It is a bold claim, I realize, but we actually caught her on several blatant lies and misrepresentations of our case,"" Via continued.

According to Via, he had worked previously with Arise Africa for over 10 years. He assured that the organization had never done anything unethical.

Via said that because he and his wife didn't want to ""steal a child"" or do anything unethical, Kelly Via tracked down Chloe's birth mother and met with her face-to-face and asked her several hard questions with the help of a translator.

One of the questions, Via recalled, was, ""What was going through your mind when you released Chloe to the babies' home?""

""We even asked, 'What if we don't adopt her?'"" Via remembered. '""What if we adopted you as a family and we sponsored you as a family? Would that make a difference so maybe you would have the finances to be able to care for her and give her and education? Would that change anything for you?'""

According to Via, the mother told his wife that when she gave her daughter up to the babies' home, she no longer considered Chloe to be her daughter.

""Nevertheless, the consolar at the embassy gathered her information and sent it off to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services with the cards clearly stacked against us,"" Via said.

In October 2012, the Via's got a letter from USCIS saying that they were going to deny Chloe's visa application. Between the May approval in the Ugandan court system and the October letter from USCIS, Via said, was a hard time for the family, as they spent much of it split between two continents.

After receiving the letter of denial, Via said he didn't know what else to do.

""I read that letter and I almost collapsed on my bathroom floor. I laid there on my back and I was so angry. I said, 'God, I don't get it. I don't understand what you are doing? You are the one who started this whole process. You put this on our heart, we are just trying to do what You called us to do. Why does it feel like your hand is actively involved in making this process difficult?' I laid there and there was no answer,"" Via said.

""I laid there and said, 'Fine. What am I supposed to do because I am so lost right now? I don't know what to do. I don't know where to go. I don't know what decision to make. I don't know. What am I supposed to do?'"" Via asked. ""He answered me with three very simple words, 'fight for her.' He said fight for her because I fought for you and what you don't understand is that I am telling a bigger story here. I am telling something so much bigger than just your adoption.'""

Via said that he walked out of the bathroom with a ""new level of clarity."" He clarified that it wasn't really a ""direction"" that God had provided because at that point he still wasn't sure what fighting for his daughter meant as far as actions he needed to take.

""I knew one thing for sure — that there would never be at time when I would stop fighting for my daughter,"" Via said.

When the Vias received a final notice of denial from the USCIS on Dec. 31, 2012, it became clear what the family needed to do.

""With our new level of clarity, we said, 'What does this look like? What do we have to do? What does fighting for her look like?'"" Via explained. ""We looked at it and we thought about it and we realized that what it meant was [to fight] the way Jesus fought for us. If you didn't come to God, then Jesus came to us.""

It was on April 3, 2013, that the Vias moved to Jinja, Uganda, almost one year after they met Chloe.

""So that is where me and my family have been working for the past five years, living and working with Arise Africa International,"" Via said.

According to the Vias' website, the Vias are actively involved in church planting, pastoral and ministry training and also do work in the babies home.

According to the Evangelicals for Life website, the Vias have planted over 20 churches, seen ""thousands become followers of Jesus,"" and are helping provide free medical care in various villages around Uganda.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/christian-dad-family-moved-to-africa-after-feds-sabotaged-daughters-adoption-214443/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
2062,2363,Scientists Develop New Method to Create Stem Cells Without Killing Human Embryos,"Expand | Collapse (Photo: Reuters/Peter Macdiarmid) Ampoules containing a medium for stem cell storage in a file photo.

A team of scientists in California have found a new way to create stem cells that doesn't require the destruction of human embryos.

Researchers at the San Francisco-based Gladstone Institute have announced that they were able to create stem cells by using skin cells from mice through a genome editing tool called CRISPR.

Sheng Ding, PhD, a senior investigator at the Gladstone Institute, said in a statement released Monday that this was an innovative means of creating stem cells for research.

""This is a new way to make induced pluripotent stem cells that is fundamentally different from how they've been created before,"" said Ding.

""At the beginning of the study, we didn't think this would work, but we wanted to at least try to answer the question: can you reprogram a cell just by unlocking a specific location of the genome? And the answer is yes.""

In a statement, the Gladstone Institute noted that they were building upon the findings of senior investigator Shinya Yamanaka, MD, PhD, who in 2006 found that ""he could make stem cells — dubbed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) — by treating ordinary skin cells with four key proteins.""

""Ding and others previously created iPSCs not with transcription factors, but by adding a cocktail of chemicals to the cells,"" noted the institute.

""The latest study, published in Cell Stem Cell, offers a third way to turn skin cells into stem cells by directly manipulating the cells' genome using CRISPR gene regulation techniques.""

Short for ""clusters of regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats,"" CRISPRs are a type of DNA sequences found in bacteria.

""CRISPR technology was adapted from the natural defense mechanisms of bacteria and archaea (the domain of single-celled microorganisms). These organisms use CRISPR-derived RNA and various Cas proteins, including Cas9, to foil attacks by viruses and other foreign bodies,"" explained Live Science.

""They do so primarily by chopping up and destroying the DNA of a foreign invader. When these components are transferred into other, more complex, organisms, it allows for the manipulation of genes, or 'editing.'""

The Gladstone Institute's breakthrough on stem cell creation comes months after an Israeli-based firm developed a new ALS treatment that uses cells extracted from bone marrow rather than embryos.

BrainStorm announced in October that it was beginning clinical treatments in the United States with the new treatment, which could help restore motor abilities for those with ALS.

""During the maturation process, the cells from the bone marrow are manipulated into behaving like brain cells, in that they produce materials that are the building blocks of the brain,"" reported The Jerusalem Post.

""When these modified cells are put back in patients, the building blocks circulate in the spinal fluid and help repair the damaged brain.""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/scientists-develop-new-method-to-create-stem-cells-without-killing-human-embryos-214991/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
2063,2364,"Joni Eareckson Tada: If Christians Don't Act, US Assisted Suicide Laws Could Become Like UK, Canada","(Photo: Joni and Friends/A. Larry Ross Communications) Joni Eareckson Tada is a radio host and the founder of the Joni and Friends International Disability Center.

WASHINGTON — Renowned evangelical author and disabilities advocate Joni Eareckson Tada is warning that the United States could one day become like Canada or more liberal European nations that promote physician-assisted suicide unless Christians push back against the trend.

Eareckson Tada, a 68-year-old quadriplegic and best-selling author, spoke with The Christian Post last week before giving a keynote address at the annual Evangelicals for Life conference in the nation's capital in which she addressed the topic of ""dignity in disability.""

Tada, the founder of the Joni and Friends International Disability Center who was paralyzed in a diving accident when she was 17, stressed that the way a strong majority of the American public and many evangelicals are quickly embracing physician-assisted suicide as a ""morally acceptable"" option when patients face terminal illnesses, she could easily see the U.S. going the way of more socially progressive nations within the next 10-plus years.

""Thirty-eight percent of evangelicals feel that it's morally permissible for physicians to help when requested for aid in dying,"" Tada said, referring to a 2016 LifeWay Research poll. ""That shows me that No. 1, we don't have a biblical worldview on suffering and we don't know how to deal with it. We want to drug it, escape it, euthanize it, do anything but live with it. No. 2, we fear it.""

""What we have done in our country is we have allowed fundamental fears to be the framework for what we think is rational, social policy,"" she continued. ""That reflects a culture of contradictions.""

Tada specifically voiced concern about the assisted suicide law in the state of Oregon, known as the Death With Dignity Act. The act permits physician-assisted suicide for people with illnesses and conditions that could lead to death within six months.

Although the law has been on the books since 1997, it was recently reported that the law was written so loosely that it could technically permit people with treatable deadly illnesses such as diabetes to refuse treatment and be eligible for physician-assisted suicide so long as they find two doctors to sign off on their request.

""It is any disease, which left untreated, could result in death within six months. Of course, that would happen if you had diabetes and you go into renal failure,"" Tada explained. ""People with muscular dystrophy, people with Lou Gehrig's disease, people in certain stages of multiple sclerosis might qualify. People with musculoskeletal diseases that, if they become despairing with their condition and decide they don't want treatment, might qualify.""

With the way that the Oregon law is written, Tada said, all it would take is ""just one court challenge"" for a judge to widen the definition to include ""someone not only with diabetes, but also with MS, MD or ALS.""

Although physician-assisted suicide in the U.S. is illegal in 44 states and legal in just six states and the District of Columbia, Tada has warned that the U.S. has been on a slippery slope since the Supreme Court ruled in 1973 to legalize abortion across the nation.

""When the Supreme Court judges determined that the U.S. Constitution has within it an inherent right to privacy, that is the birth of an entitlement society that doesn't necessarily want to ascribe positive virtue to any suffering but would rather use personal choice to not take that route,"" Tada told CP. ""Some don't want their death to be a painful and difficult death. Yes, it is understandable. But instead of channeling resources into legislation giving people a right to die, let's channel resources into better pain management, developing better pain therapies, bringing people out of social isolation, ascribing positive virtue to chronic conditions.""

""These are acts of compassion, not five patches of fentanyl on your chest and three grams of barbital,"" she added. ""That is an act of isolation, not compassion.""

Tada warned that it's not too far fetched to one day see state laws start to take the shape of more socially liberal nations.

""In Belgium, you can be 12 years old and the court will listen to your plea if you find your suffering unbearable and your parents can't intervene. That is insane,"" Tada warned. ""What court would think that a child would have the psychological wherewithal to understand the difference between life and death?""

In the Netherlands, euthanasia has become so common that it accounts for about 4.5 percent of the nation's deaths. In 2016, it was reported that man in the Netherlands was euthanized over his alcohol addiction.

In the United Kingdom, a mother was granted the right by the nation's high court in 2014 to euthanize her 12-year-old daughter who as suffering from a host of non-life-threatening injuries.

In 2016, the Canadian government passed a law allowing people who are ""incurably ill"" to seek physician-assisted suicide.

""If Christians don't [push back], then I see for sure us going the way of certainly Canada or England, hopefully not Belgium or Switzerland, where you can euthanize just if you are depressed,"" Tada said.

Tada stressed that preventing the slide down the slippery slope means Christians must do more than simply speaking out against right-to-die legislation, but also taking time out of their lives to help the family down the street who has a severely disabled child or helping a disabled person who has been so isolated from the world because of illness or injury feel connected to society again.

""To be pro-life for a long time just meant that you have to be against abortion. It's more than that. It means adoption, it means support services, crisis pregnancy centers, and the same is true for disability,"" Tada said. ""To be pro-life means that we don't want someone with diabetes to take advantage of Oregon's Death with Dignity Act. Well that means someone needs to get involved with his life and provide social support.""

""There is so much talk about mainstream and inclusion in churches. People with disabilities want to belong to a body of Christ,"" she continued. ""We want to know that when we don't show up next Sunday for services that somebody is going to miss me. We want to be a friend. We want to have friendships and relationships. We have to get rid of the mechanistic, abstract, dry, theoretical approach to people's needs and really practice Christianity with its sleeves rolled up. We just got to be involved in people's lives.""

Tada recalled her own experiences and said that when she first suffered her diving accident over 50 years ago, she was in such despair and had lost hope. She explained that she even begged her friends to bring in their mom's sleeping pills or their dad's razors.

""What changed my life were Christian friends who not only gave me the Word but gave me their time and their love and gave me a chance to go to a movie with them,"" Tada said. ""They just befriended me. We need to practice Christianity with its sleeves rolled up.""

Tada has revised her 1992 book When Is It Right To Die? that touches on how Christians should react to the trending developments of the assisted suicide movement over the last 25 years. The updated version of her book will be released later this month.

""It's a trend, but it's only a trend as far as Christians are willing to be vocal and speak out about this,"" Tada said. ""That's why I wrote, When Is It Right To Die? I wanted to give people, not only the understanding of the arguments against physician-assisted suicide, I wanted to give them a sense of what the Bible has to say and to give them language so that they can voice their opinions during coffee at Starbucks or during the local PTA meeting or with co-workers in carpool.""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/joni-eareckson-tada-if-christians-dont-act-us-assisted-suicide-laws-become-like-uk-canada-samuel-smith-215004/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

Pearl Brown suffers from a rare disorder called Alobar holoprosencephaly.

WASHINGTON — A Tennessee dad opened up about the joy and struggles his family has faced five years after he and his wife chose to carry their precious daughter to term, though they were advised by doctors to induce labor at 20 weeks of pregnancy and ""try again"" because of a rare, debilitating brain disorder.

Eric Brown, a photographer and a father of three children, gave his family's testimony Thursday before a large crowd gathered for the third annual Evangelicals for Life conference, hosted by the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission.

Brown, of Nashville, emotionally recounted the decision that faced him and his wife, Ruth, when they were informed at their 20-week ultrasound that their unborn youngest daughter, Pearl, is suffering from a disorder that doctors deemed ""not compatible with life.""

""After a pregnancy that was wrought with heartache and hope, she was diagnosed with a condition known as Alobar holoprosencephaly during our 20-week ultrasound,"" Brown recalled, referring to a disorder that caused premature stalling of brain development and Pearl to be born with a cleft upper lip and inverted nose.

""We were advised on that day to induce labor, say goodbye and try again,"" he remembered.

Brown explained that the last thing he and Ruth wanted to to do was to take away the life-giving haven that the mother was giving their daughter before she was ready to survive outside the womb. However, Brown explained that it was a ""belittling"" experience to try and convince the doctor that they wanted to carry Pearl to term.

""We knew very well what would happen if we did [what the doctor suggested], that there was no way that Pearl's body had developed enough to survive outside of Ruth's womb,"" Brown said. ""She was being sustained in there and God was still knitting her together. It seemed too cruel to us to take away the very system that was helping her broken body do what it was incapable of doing on its own.""

Pearl Joy Brown was born alive on July 27, 2012. Brown assured the audience that God has a reason for why Pearl was born with an inverted nose, lack of vision and hearing and an inability to move any part of her body ""on purpose.""

(Screenshot: ERLC) Ruth Brown lies down with her daughter, Pearl, who suffers from a rare disorder called Alobar holoprosencephaly.

""As rattling as those initial appointments were, we were confident that God was executing a plan for Pearl that He had written before the foundation of the world,"" Brown said. ""I had spent previous years doing reading on suffering and disability and God's goodness and sovereignty over such situations. We were aware on the deepest possible level that this was His doing, that He was working and that the primary reason to carry Pearl to term was not for her sake but because we ought to not interrupt the master Creator while He is at work.""

""He lovingly gave her a tiny, hollow, single-hemisphere of a brain at the tip of her brainstem. He was calling all of us to trust Him. Though He didn't necessarily call Pear's disability 'good,' He was certainly working all of it together for our good and His glory.""

According to Brown, the doctors were not confident that Pearl would survive, stating that doctors expected Pearl to die before she was born and again during the delivery and again in the early moments of her life.

But five years later, Pearl still lives even though the Browns are seemingly less optimistic about her health and have made very large sacrifices in their lives to care for their daughter, who will never be able to care for herself.

""I pleaded with God to give us that difficult life but not to go so far as to take Pearl's life. I wanted so badly the privilege of pushing her around in a wheelchair with an oxygen tank strapped to the side but I had no idea what I was asking. Often, when I look back on the desperation of those prayers, I am so thankful that I had no idea. Perhaps, if I had known how hard it would be without truly grasping how wonderfully rich life is, that I wouldn't have pleaded Pearl's case as vigorously as I did.""

With Pearl in their lives, the Browns' lives had drastically changed. However, they are not alone. Brown praised his church community and friends for rallying around his family in their time of need.

""I could tell you how our pastor's wife joined us for so many of those extended ultrasounds or how friends paid our bills so that I could quit a job that required travel. I could tell you how for months, our church cooked our meals for us or sometimes they just came in and cried in our living room while sharing how God was changing them through Pearl,"" Brown explained. ""I could even tell you how friends even held a benefit concert before she was born and how they bought us a minivan after she came home alive because our tiny sedan couldn't hold all the medical equipment.""

""Everytime that [we] sat down for a dinner together, we were keenly aware that Pearl was also sitting down for the same meal,"" he added.

Although Pearl has survived outside the womb for this long, Brown said that his daughter's health seems to be taking a turn for the worse because of new complications.

""They are different [complications] and we suspect, as do the doctors, that her body is growing weary. She doesn't seem to be standing in line for a miraculous turnaround,"" Brown said as he fought back tears. ""And though her best day will likely be our worst, this seems to be the next chapter for our family. Pearl can't hustle or chase her dreams. She isn't having her best life now. ... She has not been healed as we pleaded for during her first year.""

Rest assured, Brown asserted that ""God is with Pearl and has not left her to her own devices.""

""The promises that He made to her will, in large part, not be fulfilled until after her final breath. He cares for her, as she bears His image,"" Brown asserted. ""She, like all of us, is completely helpless otherwise. So if the theology that you are teaching, or the banner that you are waving, can't honestly be preached to Pearl in her current state, then it is probably not true. At the very least, perhaps you should hold it loosely.""

""It's true that Pearl takes a disproportionate amount of resources from most everyone in her life,"" he added. ""The great news, however, is that no matter that resource, we are all drawing from the King's coffers.""

The Browns' dedication and love for their daughter earned the praise of prominent disability rights activist and evangelical author Joni Eareckson Tada, who has suffered from quadriplegia for over 50 years after a diving accident.

""Eric chose a very noble and courageous route,"" Eareckson Tada told The Christian Post during the conference. ""There are many parents who would not do that.""

2079,2382,Simone Biles' Mother Wants to Address Team USA Sexual Abuser Larry Nassar in Court,"(Photo: Reuters/Lucy Nicholson) Simone Biles, the most decorated gymnast in the United States.

Simone Biles' mother has said she wants to appear in court for the criminal sentencing of former Team USA gymnastics physician Dr. Larry Nassar whom her daughter has accused of molestation.

Biles, the record holder for the most gold medals won by an American female gymnast in a single Olympic game, spoke Monday about the sexual misconduct committed by Nassar.

Nassar has pled guilty to 10 counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct in Michigan's Ingham County Circuit Court, and is in court this week hearing the testimonies of an estimated 98 victims as part of his criminal sentencing process.

While it is unclear whether Biles' testimony will be used this week, her mother publicly expressed a desire to attend the proceedings on behalf of her daughter.

""l would love to be in this courtroom to address Larry on your behalf/love you,"" Nellie Biles tweeted Tuesday.

Her daughter simply responded, ""I love you mom.""

Just one day prior, Simone admitted that she had been afraid to come forward with her allegations against Nassar.

""I've felt a bit broken and the more I try to shut off the voice in my head the louder it screams. I am not afraid to tell my story anymore,"" she wrote in a social media post. ""I, too, am one of the many survivors who was sexually abused by Larry Nassar. Please believe me when I say it was a lot harder to first speak those words out loud than it is now to put them on paper.""

She added, ""there are so many reasons that I have been reluctant to share my story, but I know now it is not my fault.""

While it is unclear whether Biles or her testimony will appear in court this week, she did ask people for privacy as she sorts through the traumatic matter.

""As I continue to work through the pain, I kindly ask everyone to respect my privacy,"" she wrote. ""This is a process, and one that I need more time to work through.""

Biles and countless other gymnasts have spoken up about being abused by Nassar at the elite sports training center called the Karyolyi ranch in Huntsville, Texas. In her open letter, Biles admitted to feeling apprehensive about returning to the training facility.

""It is impossibly difficult to relive these experiences and it breaks my heart even more to think that as I work toward my dream of competing in Tokyo 2020, I will have to continually return to the same training facility where I was abused,"" she revealed. ""After hearing the brave stories of my friends and other survivors, I know that this horrific experience does not define me. I am much more than this.""

Biles' teammates Aly Raisman and Gabby Douglas have also previously spoken out about being victims of Nassar's actions. This week, Raisman agreed with Biles and said she hopes that no one has to return to the ranch where such traumatic events occurred.

""I hope USA Gymnastics listens because they haven't listened to us so far. I hope they listen and I hope they don't make any of the girls go back to the ranch,"" Raisman said on ESPN's ""Outside the Lines"" this week. ""No one should have to go back there after so many of us were abused there.""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/simone-biles-mother-wants-to-address-team-usa-sexual-abuser-larry-nassar-court-214147/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
2080,2383,"'12 Strong': Actors Chris Hemsworth, Michael Peña Talk Dangers of Doubt and the Power of Belief (Video)","LOS ANGELES — The war drama ""12 Strong: The Declassified Story of the Horse Soldiers"" hits theaters Jan. 19 and two of the film's leading cast members, Chris Hemsworth and Michael Peña, talk about the amazing faith that it took for 12 American soldiers to survive when tasked to take out the Taliban after Sept. 11, 2001.

Produced by one of the biggest producers in Hollywood, Jerry Bruckheimer (""Armageddon,"" ""Pirates of the Caribbean""), the movie focuses on 12 American Green Berets who are sent to Afghanistan as a special forces unit.

""12 Strong"" is based on the unclassified New York Times Best Seller, Horse Soldiers by Doug Stanton.

""'12 Strong' is one of the great unknown stories of American valor. In the wake of Sept. 11th, twelve brave U.S. soldiers dropped everything and ventured into an unknown land, outnumbered 5,000 to 1 to complete one of the most successful special forces missions of all time. Once there, the soldiers develop an uneasy partnership with the Northern Alliance to take down the Taliban and its al-Qaida allies. Outgunned and outnumbered, they had to use the rudimentary tactics of the Afghan horse soldiers rather than state-of-the-art warfare to battle the heavily-armed Taliban. This is the amazing story of these 12 heroes and the families who wondered if they would come home alive,"" a description of the film explains.

Unlike ""The Avengers,"" this film tells the story of real-life heroes. It features ""Thor"" himself, Hemsworth, as the heroic Captain Mitch Nelson and co-stars Michael Peña (""Crash,"" ""World Trade Center""), Michael Shannon (""Revolutionary Road""), Geoff Stults (""Enlisted""), William Fichtner (""Black Hawk Down""), Trevante Rhodes (""Moonlight"") and Rob Riggle (""Hangover').

When asked about the role of a hero and why it's important for people to step up to the challenge in this day and age despite the challenges, Hemsworth said he thinks people need to be born with that leader quality.

Expand | Collapse (Photo: Warner Brothers) ""12 Strong"" Hit's theaters January 19, 2018.

""It's certainly an added weight and responsibility, telling this story, portraying these guys, having them on set with us giving us advice and so on. We had a wealth of knowledge at our fingertips. There is a sort of unwavering certainty with these guys, and a belief that this is what they were put on this earth to do,"" Hemsworth told The Christian Post.

""I think you're either born with that or not in this sense. You can find confidence and belief and so on but what was so impressive about these guys is that there was no massive ego or anything, this was their job,"" he shared.

Actor Peña played the supporting role of Sgt. First Class Sam Diller, one of the 12 soldiers in Captain Nelson's crew. The popular Mexican-American actor spoke on the importance of family and how vital of a role that played in helping these soldiers make it back home.

""That's the reason that these guys go out and fight ... they are guarding America and its freedom. One of those freedoms, which not every country does have, is the freedom of family — to take care of their family and be with their family. They want to come back to their family and come back alive,"" Peña stated.

""12 Strong"" has an underlying theme of faith and shows the power of unity and determination. Hemsworth recently put his Christian belief on display at Disneyland in December 2017. The 34-year-old actor was featured in a Christmas ceremony that featured a candlelit choir singing Christian carols as he read the story of Christ's birth found in the gospel of Luke.

When asked to discuss the importance of faith in relation to ""12 Strong"" and the world today, Hemsworth talked about the role belief played in keeping the soldiers going those few weeks while in Afghanistan. He maintained that doubt would have been detrimental to their survival.

""You've got to have something to live for,"" Hemsworth stated. ""Whether it be family, or religion, the community, friends or your country. If you're fighting not just for your country [but] the people in your immediate group [then] you want to get back for something.""

The action-packed film shows that Mitch Nelson had to say goodbye to a wife and a little girl. However, Mark Nutsch, the real-life captain who inspired the character, had two little boys (4 and 3 years old), and a wife who was six months pregnant when he left for war and she gave birth while he was away. Nevertheless, he kept his eye on the mission and did not allow uncertainty to creep in.

""If these guys start doubting their survival in this position or wavering on what they can achieve, then I think it's a snowball effect and starts to crumble so [you have] to constantly hang on to why you're doing this,"" he concluded.

Peña, who once accredited all of his success to the Church of Scientology in 2016, chimed in on CP's question concerning the power of Christian faith.

""There's always this special element, especially as an actor I get to read some really amazing stories about someone who went to war and did something spectacular, or someone in sports, or maybe a civil rights activist and they always have this belief beyond themselves that they're able to have other people agree on,"" Peña stated.

""I think that's when you can really do something special in this life. It does take belief because there's quite a bit of drama going on in your head but when you're able to make it come true, I think that's when it's really special.""

When it comes to displaying the faith of the American soldiers, ""12 Strong"" leaves out any overt signs of Christianity but it does explore two different sides of the Muslim faith. The Taliban is seen killing innocent people in the name of ""Allah."" And in another scene, the Afghanistan Northern Alliance leader Commander Ahmed Lal accredits their God to giving them the motivation to keep fighting for justice.

Off script, however, one of the real-life heroes portrayed in the Warner Brothers release, Bob Pennington, told Patheos.com that it was, in fact, his faith in God that helped his team accomplish the ""miracle mission.""

""We easily should have been killed several times,"" Pennington explained to Patheos. ""I always thank Him for watching over me and I still do. Even beyond the film, we did more harrowing things and in each case, I believe there was some divine intervention.""

""God wants you to have confidence and believe that He's right there beside you. That's how I looked at it. I absolutely believed, 'Hey, we can make it out of here and we can do the job that we need to do,'"" he added.

Although it features violence and strong language, not suitable for children, ""12 Strong"" can serve as an encouragement to others to model after the bravery and resilience of the 12.

2081,2384,Megachurch Pastor Fights Against Belief in Hell in Netflix Film Based on Real Events,"(Screenshot: Youtube/Netflix) Chiwetel Ejiofor as preacher Carlton Pearson in the Netflix film ""Come Sunday,"" scheduled for April 2018.

A Netflix film based on the life of a former evangelical megachurch pastor, who rejected belief in Hell and in doing so lost his congregation, released on Sunday a trailer clip featuring a heated debate on God and people in eternal damnation.

The clip from the upcoming ""Come Sunday"" film features actor Chiwetel Ejiofor playing preacher Carlton Pearson, who at one point in the 1990s led Higher Dimensions Evangelistic Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

As the clip shows, Pearson asks one church elder during a debate whether he would not save his own father in Hell, to which the elder says that it is not up to him, but to God. Pearson insists that anyone would try to save their father, no matter what they had done, and asks ""Are we more merciful than God?""

Following the real-life events, the movie presents how Pearson publicly renounces his belief in Hell, and comes to support ""a variation on universal reconciliation and the Gospel of Inclusion,"" which falls outside mainstream Christianity.

Pearson faces significant backlash from the faith community he shephered for his decision, which also leads to him being banned from the Oral Roberts University campus and being branded a heretic by numerous Christian leaders.

The pastor, who was a consultant on the film, set to be released in April, now serves as the leader of ""Streaming Consciousness Network"" in Chicago.

As the Hollywood Reporter said in a film review, ""this is a rare film about an evangelical church from outside the faith-based channels that questions without either judging or condescending.""

""With unstinting compassion, the film traces the dismantling of all that Carlton and his congregation have built together, never losing sight of the personal cost to him as he continues to wrestle with his beliefs,"" it adds.

Speaking about the film with Tulsa World, Pearson said: ""When I watched the first draft, I didn't realize how raw my emotions still are.

""It was very tender for me. You think you're over something until you recall it and reconnect with it.""

Despite mainstream theological teachings, a survey by LifeWay Research in 2016 found that 64 percent of evangelicals believe everyone will go to Heaven, which was even higher than the 60 percent of the general American public who think the same.

At the same time, 84 percent of those with evangelical beliefs affirmed that Hell is a real place of eternal judgment. Only 30 percent of non-evangelicals said that they agree.

Other popular megachurch pastors who have rejected Hell, and later left their church, include Rob Bell, once of Mars Hill Bible Church in Michigan.

Although theologians, such as Dr. Albert Mohler Jr., president of The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky., have praised Bell as a ""master communicator,"" they have warned that such arguments ""alienate love from justice and holiness.""

""Bell wants to rescue God from any teaching that His wrath is poured out upon sin and sinners, certainly in any eternally conscious sense,"" Mohler has argued.

""But Bell also wants God to vindicate the victims of murder, rape, child abuse, and similar evil. He seems not to recognize that he has undercut his own story, leaving God unable or unwilling to bring true justice.""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/megachurch-pastor-fights-against-belief-in-hell-in-netflix-film-based-on-real-events-214685/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

Sope Aluko, a Christian actress who has landed a role in the upcoming ""Black Panther"" blockbuster, said that she and her fellow actors testified about God's miracles on the set of the movie.

Aluko will play Shaman in the Marvel Studios film based off of the Black Panther superhero that will arrive in theaters on Feb. 16. When speaking about being cast alongside the likes of renowned actors Lupita Nyong'o, Michael B. Jordan, and Forest Whitaker, Aluko revealed that breaks on set were almost like church.

""It felt very familiar and like home. We had early call times but I didn't even feel the long set hours because it was such a good time,"" she told OkayAfrica Friday. ""I didn't feel like I was amongst stars, everyone was so down to earth and normal. During breaks we shared our testimony of how we got to where [we] did and most of the people were testifying to God's miracles, it was almost like church.""

Aluko often uses her social media platforms to post Bible verses. Last April, the actress shared an Instagram image of herself with ""Black Panther"" co-star and fellow Christian actress Angela Bassett, reflecting on the goodness of God on Palm Sunday.

""Reflecting on God's goodness this #PalmSunday and this iconic, kind, genuine, humble, and graceful soul @im.angelabassett who I was blessed to work with recently. #Godisgood #actorslife #blessedandhighlyfavored #WorkingMomActor,"" she wrote.

Bassett, who plays Ramonda, the mother of the king, previously spoke about her faith with The Christian Post. When Bassett made her directorial debut in the 2015 Lifetime film ""Whitney"" based on the late singer Whitney Houston's life, she spoke about leaning on Scripture when encountering challenges in the process.

""Doubt seeped in but thank God for faith. All things work together for good, for those who love the Lord and are called according to His purpose,"" Bassett said, quoting Romans 8:28.

I am not one of those who would consider myself to have had phenomenal success in the ministry--by most metrics. We did not grow exponentially and send out a dozen missionaries and pastors. We have grown. We have shrunk. We have grown again.

I have had discontent individuals complain over the fact that our church did not have enough elderly members, not enough programs, an unpaved parking lot, that I did not dress nicely enough, that my wife looks too young, there are too many kids, that there are not enough kids, that we sing too many old hymns, that we do not sing enough old hymns, and so on. There seems to be no shortage of illegitimate reasons why people leave a local church in which they are truly loved, pastored, and held up in prayer.

The leader of the Bethel worship ministry, Joel Taylor, and his wife, Janie, celebrated a Christmas miracle in January as their two small children, who were battling a dangerous E. coli infection, are now home and completely healthy.

The Taylor family first announced their frightening ordeal over the holidays. Joel and Janie Taylor reported that their 2-year-old son, Jaxon, was fighting a deadly E. coli infection that had shut down his kidneys and caused multiple life-threatening complications. Just a few days later, the parents shared that their 4-year-old daughter, Addie, had contracted the same virus, although her diagnosis was not as severe. While others were enjoying family time and celebrating the birth of Jesus, the Taylors were pleading for prayer.

After weeks of fighting the infection and receiving discouraging doctors' reports, the family happily reported last week that both kids were better. Their son, who was diagnosed with HUS (Hemolytic-uremic syndrome), a type of anemia caused by the destruction of red blood cells that led him to have acute kidney failure, was all healed and leaving the hospital.

""Merry Christmas from the Taylors! Christmas Day was 4 weeks ago today and Jaxon was hanging on by prayers,"" the proud father posted on Monday along with a photo of his happy family all dressed in Christmas PJs while in front of a Christmas tree and gifts. ""Today we celebrate our Christmas miracle with our healthy and happy babies in our own home! We kept Christmas in a time capsule for this special day.""

""So much to be thankful for this year! We can't thank you all enough for all of your prayers and support,"" he added.

Thousands around the world began to pray for the children as reports of their condition made headlines, and the parents continually testified that the prayers worked.

""Thanks to your prayers, Addie's diarrhea has slowed down significantly, which is the opposite of what the drs said would happen. Your prayers are working! Please keep praying for complete healing and no complications,"" Janie shared a few weeks ago as God answered all of the Taylor family's petitions.

Sadie Robertson says Scripture kept her from giving in to fear when she spent time in Somalia last year just before a massive bombing.

The ""Duck Dynasty"" alumna turned motivational speaker and author who is readying her book, Live Fearless: A Call to Power, Passion, and Purpose, opened up about how she overcame fear when visiting Mogadishu, Somalia, in October. Robertson shared how she overcame struggles with fear at the ""I Am...2018 With Sadie Robertson"" conference hosted by Hope Church in Tupelo, Mississippi, Sunday.

The conference was aimed at helping young women realize who they are in Christ. When posting an Instagram video from the event, Robertson detailed how Scripture helped her quell fear when she and her mother, Korie Robertson, traveled there to help deliver food to thousands after the country suffered from a drought.

""When I was in Mogadishu, Somalia, back in October I felt as though I was staring at the face of fear. For someone who has dealt with fear, anxiety, and panic attacks I had to really be on guard to not allow the enemy to use that from stopping what God had purposed for the trip,"" Sadie said. ""One of the nights there I woke up and began to feel a panic attack creeping in and the feeling of fear surrounding. I leaned over and grabbed my mom and the first words I gasp out was READ PSALMS 91.""

A post shared by Sadie Robertson (@legitsadierob) on Jan 21, 2018 at 11:39pm PST

After her mother declared the word of God to her daughter, Sadie said the feelings of fear began to dissipate.

""As we began to say who our father was the fear left the room and a peace invaded. The enemy was on the move to kill, steal, and destroy what God has purposed for that trip, but when He got right up close and the words and power of who our God is came in and canceled the assignment of fear that the enemy tried to throw at me,"" she wrote. ""I am a fearless daughter because my Father is my refuge. This daughter has found her confidence in her father.""

The Robertsons escaped the area just before a bombing that killed over 500 people took place in Mogadishu, one mile from their hotel. In an Instagram message posted just after the bombing took place, Sadie revealed how heartbroken she was about the devastation.

""[One] hour after our plane took off this morning a massive bomb went off less than a half mile from the hotel I have been staying at and very near to the homes of all of my friends there... The area at this point is unrecognizable,"" she wrote in October. ""These new friends of mine are passionate, hopeful, hardworking, beautiful, loving, and human just like you. They have been through more in life than many of us can understand, but stronger then many of us will ever be.""

2277,2603,Luis Palau on His Bucket List: I Want to Preach to 'a Million Chinese in Tiananmen Square' (Interview Part 1),"(Photo: Luis Palau Association) Evangelist Luis Palau is seen in this 2004 file photo.

NEW YORK — Luis Palau, who started his missionary career in 1962, has traveled the world preaching the Gospel to millions. Yet, the 80-year-old Argentinian evangelist says there are still a few special locales remaining on his bucket list of places to bring the Good News.

Palau, who recently preached to an estimated 60,000 people in New York City's famous Central Park, has ""personally shared the Gospel with more than 30 million people through evangelistic events in more than 75 nations, and hundreds of millions more through radio and television,"" according to his self-named ministry, The Luis Palau Association.

In the first of a two-part interview with The Christian Post, Palau comments on his most recent campaign, NY CityFest-CityServe, which brought together 1,700 local churches to assist their communities and schools through service projects. He also shares what he has learned by working with the NYC Latino evangelical community and lists some of the top places around the world where he would still like to preach.

The interview was conducted on Saturday, July 11, before Palau was to deliver his main message on stage at NY CityFest in Central Park. The transcript has been edited for clarity, and the questions re-worded for better context.

(Photo: The Luis Palau Association) Evangelist Luis Palau speaks on stage on the Great Lawn at Central Park on July 11, 2015, in New York City.

CP: What is the NY CityFest Central Park event about?

Palau: Today (Saturday, July 11) is a climax of sorts of a certain wave but it will carry on. This now will go on, God willing, for many years. The cooperation is growing among churches. The number of churches, I think, is growing. Some, the minority churches, the Latinos particularly, but others also, have always felt a little isolated. I think now they feel more integrated, properly so. I think there's going to be in the future more working together. I hope the Latinos, senior people who have authority over congregations or denominations, that they will see that this is an opportunity to lead the Body of Christ, the Church, forward.

Some that I thought have a reputation in town, but have not involved themselves, I think have forfeited the authority over some ... many, many currents of the evangelical movement and they've forfeited their authority and they'll never recuperate it.

Many of the pastors who are small church pastors, the vast majority have to work two jobs, they're bi-vocational. I honor them for that. I just bow before these fellows, who with their families have two jobs: pastoring a church and working for a cash-living. I honor their faithfulness and the spouse's faithfulness. So we learned it by accident. We wanted to have a meeting at 10 a.m. and none of the churches appeared, only a few hot shots who had a secretary and an assistant, you know. Then we realized, they're working that's why.

Those Latino fellows, and there are others, too, I think that these guys are gonna be leaders in the future. And not the long-term future. I was exhorting some of them right on the platform: ""It's your chance to bless the Body and lead the Body of Christ."" Because the Body of Christ needs leadership, not authoritative or from the top down, but just moral, spiritual, motivational, in the Holy Spirit. … Motivate God's people to witness and to serve and do it in fellowship. That was the prayer of the Lord Jesus.

I've been speaking in a lot in the churches the last two years and one of my main themes is John 17: Father, may they be one so that the world may believe that you sent me. So (Jesus') great passion was that ""the world may believe that they sent me."" How is that done? By uniting the Body. How do you unite the Body? By being filled with the indwelling Christ, because He says, ""Father, you in me and I in them so that we may be perfectly one.""

What makes us one is not the form of baptism or that we have male or female pastors or secondary issues, but it's Christ in us. That gives us the motivation to love. Anyway, long sermon there. But it's true, it's important. And I think the leadership of the evangelical movement of New York is gonna change hands. It was in hands that refused to use the authority that God gave them and now I think you're gonna see Latinos, Jamaicans, Koreans — I was excited to be in a Korean church where they really tried to bring in Latinos, and they did, quite a bit. They have to keep working on it, because there are cultural things and so on.

CP: What is going to happen when you pack up and leave NYC?

Palau: Well, I hope people will be relieved (laughs). I think what will happen is now they'll really get going. So I think that they will get going to what we've been talking about, keep doing more of the same, keep multiplying the unity. I sure hope they follow, and I think every intention is that. I hope that those who kinda sat on the sidelines because they're too busy will come to realize that the Scripture urges us to be one, and act like one and push like one.

CP: I read a report on you from a couple of years ago that said you had a dream about preaching in New York …

Palau: Not a dream-dream, just in my heart, you know. When Billy Graham had his crusade here in 1957 at the old Madison Square Garden, I got bulletins. They put out a bulletin everyday. It was three months at the old Madison Square Garden, every night. And they put out a bulletin of conversions and what they were gonna do this week, and da-da-da. A missionary's kid who was studying in Toronto came down to help that summer and he mailed it to me. Every two or three days he'd put it in an envelope, and I read it and I thought, ""Someday I'm gonna preach in New York.""

That was the dream … a vision, a desire, you know. Because New York is like Buenos Aires, very big, kind of pretends to be self-sufficient. I think since 9/11 a bit of that has been chopped off, you know, a little less chip on the shoulder kind of thing. But New York and Buenos Aries are alike that way.

CP: Would you say that today is the fulfillment of that dream or big desire?

Palau: Well, yes. Now, evangelists you know, if you give them 60,000, they want 120,000, give them 120,000 they want 250,000, so you have that. We could have had more if the police hadn't put the barrier around you know. I'm not blaming the police, they're doing what the law demands. If we had a free place, there could have been 300,000, 400,000 people easily. But still, who doesn't rejoice to see a crowd like this one, cheering the Lord, worshipping and standing for so many hours. But the Holy Spirit is at work in New York. … There's a great hunger in New York. There is spiritual hunger …

CP: You are 80 years old, you've preached in countless countries before millions of people. What's next for you?

Palau: I'd like to go to Cuba. You know, we're working on that because I couldn't go in the past for various reasons. I dream of having a large campaign in Paris, France. And of course, number one in my book, is Beijing, China. We have been going in and out of China now for 15 years and we're still waiting for the day that the Lord might open the door. … I want to have a million Chinese in Tiananmen Square. That's what I want to do, that's my dream for the future.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/luis-palau-on-his-bucket-list-i-want-to-preach-to-a-million-chinese-in-tiananmen-square-interview-part-1-141455/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
2278,2604,Filmmakers Begin Movie on Luis Palau's Life Amid Cancer Diagnosis,"(Photo: The Luis Palau Association) Evangelist Luis Palau preaches at Radio City Music Hall on July 7, 2015, in New York City.

On the heels of the shocking announcement that beloved world-renowned evangelist Luis Palau was diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer, filmmakers have begun shooting a movie about his life.

""Did you know some friends of the ministry have decided to do a movie on my life?"" Palau revealed in a Facebook post containing a video of actor Gaston Pauls dressed as a young Palau.

At the top of the year, before sharing with the world that he was officially diagnosed with cancer, Palau actually shared that filming on the autobiographical film had started in Argentina. Filmmakers are hoping to have it released in Latin America and the USA in October 2018.

""It's quite surreal watching someone take on your persona and story. They just created a Facebook page so you can follow along. Visit Palau Movie and be sure to click 'Like,'"" he told his supporters. ""Please join us in praying for the movie, that it would honor the Lord and clearly share the Good News.""

In the video that Palau shared, well-known Argentine actor, TV host and producer Gaston Pauls is heard sharing his excitement to begin shooting.

""Hi everyone. We are here at the wardrobe fitting preparing for next Monday [when] we are going to start our film 'Palau'!"" Pauls announced.

""Palau,"" which is currently the title of the film, was writen and is being directed by Kevin Knoblock.

Also featured in the film are Alexandra Bard (who plays Palau's wife, Pat), Santiago Achaga, (22-year-old Luis Palau), Agustin Amoedo (10-year-old Luis Palau), Fabian Carrasco (Palau's father, Luis Sr.), Darren Dowler (Billy Graham) and more.

(Photo: Facebook/Palau Movie) Luis Palau, Gaston Pauls and movie production staff during a meeting in Portland, November 14, 2017. ·

Palau was joined by his two sons, Kevin and Andrew, on Thursday to reveal that Palau was diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer recently.

""We wanted to tape this video to tell the whole world that love dad and the work that we do what's been going on in dad's life,"" Kevin, president of Luis Palau Ministries, said in the social media video posted Thursday.

""To our surprise, the early report that we got just before Christmas [said] that there was some cancer inside one of dad's lungs,"" Kevin explained.

They got extra testing done and went to an oncologist who revealed the terminal diagnosis.

""Just a few days ago we got the word that it's stage 4 lung cancer. That's a shock, especially with someone who's always been as healthy as dad,"" he continued.

Palau added that's it's been an emotional time for him. He confessed that the first thing he did was cry.

""I think 'oh wow, I can be gone in a few months' and one silly thought that came to mind is that I won't be able to pick up the phone and talk to the boys and hear their voice and talk to my wife,"" he emotionally shared.

""This is sad, I don't feel panic or horror. If [I'm] healed, hallelujah! And many people are praying that the Lord will do a miracle. It would take literally a miracle, medically speaking.""

Despite the sad news, production on ""Palau"" the movie will continue and the 83-year-old is remaining optimistic that he will be around to see all the Lord will do the rest of the year. To stay up to date on Palau's condition, go to Palau.org.

2283,2610,5 Things You Should Know About the Women in Ministry Debate,"(Photo: Reuters/Phil Noble) Woman clergy take photographs of the first female bishop in the Church of England Libby Lane following her consecration service at York Minster in York, northern England, January 26, 2015.

A lively conversation continues to occur surrounding the topic of women's ordination and their roles in the life of the Church, with signs pointing to notable shifts and some saying a ""crack-up"" is underway within evangelicalism.

The ongoing debate is over what the Bible really says about complementarianism and egalitarianism, and the implications that has for the Church, the home, and society.

At Mere Orthodoxy last month, writer Jake Meador said in a column titled ""The Evangelical Gender Crack-Up"" that the general agreement among evangelical Christians about how to approach gender issues is no longer holding. That is to say, the ""consensus that has existed amongst most conservative evangelicals for some time is beginning to fracture — and in more than one direction.""

Central to this discussion is the role of women in ministry. Complementarians generally believe that women are forbidden from holding certain offices in the Church, while egalitarians insist that Scripture does not warrant such restrictions.

Here are five things you should know about this ongoing, often-spirited theological debate.

1. History and tradition favors the complementarian viewpoint.

Theologians Gregory A. Boyd and Paul R. Eddy explore this topic in their book, Across the Spectrum: Understanding Issues in Evangelical Theology, and note that ""the complementarian view has been the dominant view throughout Church history. The Church has always encouraged and valued the significant contributions of women in many areas of ministry, but the Church has almost always forbidden women leaders until recent times.""

The authors further note that ""there is a diversity of opinion on the matter, many complementarians interpret the New Testament prohibitions regarding women in leadership to mean only that women should not function as the top spiritual leader and teacher of a congregation.""

2. Whether or not women are permitted to serve the Church in an ordained capacity often centers on seemingly straight-forward New Testament scriptures like 1 Timothy 2:12, 1 Timothy 3:2, and 1 Corinthians 11:7-9.

The words of the Apostle Paul to his spiritual son in 1 Timothy 2:12 read: ""But I do not allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man, but to remain quiet.""

Complementarians argue that this verse is among the clearest scriptural evidence for support of their stance.

In an interview with the Gospel Coalition in 2008, Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary New Testament professor Andreas J. Köstenberger said that those who hold to complete gender equality not just in ""terms of personal worth and dignity and salvation in Christ but also in terms of ecclesiastical role, naturally cannot accept this natural reading of the passage and as a result have resorted to various ways of reinterpreting [it],"" and fail to meet several essential exegetical criteria for biblical interpretation.

By contrast, egalitarians contend that this verse is addressing a particular context and that Paul's writing here should not be taken as a blanket prohibition.

In a widely read article on his Patheos blog last summer, renown New Testament scholar and Asbury Seminary professor Ben Witherington III notes that the translation of the phrase ""I do not allow a woman"" in the Greek is most accurately rendered ""I am not currently permitting women."" Paul is correcting women in this case, he emphasizes, ""not because they are women but because they are in this instance causing this problem [interrupting and asking questions at an inappropriate time].""

(Photo: Courtesy of Paul Lee) Messengers at the 2015 Southern Baptist Convention annual meeting worship together in between small group and corporate prayer time during the June 16 evening session dedicated to prayer at the Greater Columbus Convention Center.

3. Some of the contentiousness surrounding this issue has stemmed from assertions some leaders have made about women in roles outside the Church, roles that the Bible does not speak to with pristine clarity.

Complementarian John Piper responded last year to the question, ""Should Women Be Police Officers?"" with a lengthy explanation — admitting he sounded like a ""dinosaur"" — about continuums of influence and appropriateness of certain jobs. He concluded that ""if a woman's job involves a good deal of directives toward men, they will need to be non-personal in general, or men and women won't flourish in the long run in that relationship without compromising profound biblical and psychological issues.""

Owen Strachan, also a complementarian, and the former head of the Council for Biblical Manhood and Womanhood, caught some heat for saying that stay-at-home dads constitute ""man fails"" in a 2012 article in the Journal for Biblical Manhood and Womanhood.

4. Egalitarians are sometimes told that supporting women in ministry in ordained leadership roles opens the door to revisionist sexual ethics and same-sex unions, a charge they dispute.

Historically speaking, some denominations, like the Episcopal Church USA, that have ordained women have also sanctioned same-sex unions and promoted openly gay clergy, but this is not true of everyone. The Pentecostal Assemblies of God, for example, hold fast to the historic Christian view of marriage and sexual ethics and simultaneously believe that women can serve in ordained ministry, according to their position papers.

In a phone interview with The Christian Post on Monday, Asbury's Ben Witherington said the slippery-slope argument from complementarians about egalitarians embracing revisionist sexual ethics is ""bogus"" and contends these are separate issues entirely.

""That's kind of like saying, 'Well, if I kind of like boxing well then obviously it's also true that I'm going to be supporting MMA and all kinds of other atrocious activities.' You're comparing two things that really shouldn't be compared,"" Witheringon said.

""The New Testament is very clear that same-sex sexual activity is sin. The New Testament is equally clear that women should be allowed to be teachers and sharers of the Gospel ... the promotion of women in ministry has to do with what spiritual gifts they have, it does not have to do with their gender one way or the other,"" he added.

5. Egalitarians point to women in leadership in the New Testament for scriptural support for their position.

Junia is identified as an Apostle in Romans 16:7.

Phoebe was a leader in the church in Cenchrea and is called first person ever identified as a ""deacon"" (Romans 16:1), though some translations of the Bible label her as ""servant.""

Priscilla is sometimes thought to be the author of Hebrews and both she and Aquila taught Apollos, (Acts 18:26).

Paul also calls Euodia and Syntyche co-workers in the same breath as Clement and many others, (Philippians 4:2-3).",https://www.christianpost.com/news/5-things-you-should-know-about-the-women-in-ministry-debate-168429/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
2303,2638,"Nashville Statement Is Biblical But Lacks Pastoral Wisdom, Further Alienates LGBT Persons: Scholars","Expand | Collapse (Photo: Vimeo/Eternity College) Preston Sprinkle discusses his new class on homosexuality and the Bible as part of a trailer for the spring semester course.

The response to the Nashville Statement continues with some scholars now saying it damages the church's already negative reputation with homosexuals, and lacks pastoral wisdom even though they agree with the document theologically.

Writing on his website Sunday, New York Times bestselling author Preston Sprinkle, who is currently a full-time speaker, noted that although he stood with the authors and signers of the Nashville Statement — a document published last week by the Council of Biblical Manhood and Womanhood and the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission that promotes the long-held Christian view of marriage and sexual ethics — it falls short on important fronts.

""I do believe that [the signers have] gone about this all wrong and it will tarnish the church's already tarnished reputation with LGBT+ people,"" Sprinkle wrote, saying that the statement came across as ""one-sided"" and that it ""fails to own up to the many—MANY—mistakes that theologically orthodox believers have made in this conversation.""

Sprinkle took particular issue with the ""impersonal"" and ""outdated"" language in several of the statement's articles as well as its narrow focus, as others have, especially with article 7, which argues against ""adopting a homosexual or transgender self-conception.""

Although former homosexuals Christopher Yuan and Rosaria Butterfield are among the statement's initial signatories and do not identify as ""gay,"" Sprinkle maintains that what one opts to call oneself presents a more complex issue.

""[T]here are many original signers of the NS that have taken a very hard line against ever adopting the term 'gay Christian'—even if the person believes in a traditional view of marriage,"" Sprinkle said.

Documents like the Nashville Statement, which by their nature demand adherence, unnecessarily exclude these faithful Christians, he went on to say. He has spent many hours reading on sexuality-related topics and speaking with friends who identify as all sorts of things and concluded that ""this specific conversation is ten times more complicated than most people realize, and a thousand times more complicated than article 7 makes it out to be.""

About the same time as the publication of the Nashville Statement, Sprinkle released a 20-minute film called, ""Dear Church: I'm Gay."" While the film makes a point to endorse the historic Christian view of sexuality, it delves deeply into the pastoral nuances and complexities, telling the stories of several Christians who have had various levels of experience with same-sex attraction and homosexuality. Also included in the short film is the story of a noncelibate gay man who no longer believes his Christian faith but whose parents are Christian and have stayed in relationship with him even as they do not agree with homosexual practice.

""While we absolutely need to celebrate and promote Christianity's historic view of marriage and sexual expression,"" Sprinkle reiterated, he emphaized that ""we need to do so much more thoughtfully and much more holistically—pounding the pulpit for truth and grace.""

In similar fashion, Pastor Josh Daffern of MTV Church in Columbus, Mississippi, thought the Nashville Statement lacked pastoral wisdom and that it contained a few ""fatal"" flaws that gave him enough reason to never sign it.

""This statement reminds me of a married couple that constantly has arguments,"" Daffern wrote on his Patheos blog Tuesday, noting that as a conservative evangelical pastor he had ""no qualms with the individual tenets"" of the statement but, like Sprinkle, objected to some of the language used in it. And, he continued, the Nashville Statement was crafted mostly by academics and scholars who are mostly sealed off from people who do not think like them and that the document ultimately impedes the Great Commission.

Daffern mentioned that he has a lesbian woman who has been attending his church for about a month and is reportedly battling addictions and is struggling with several other issues in her life.

""If I preached on the Nashville Statement and declared my allegiance, would that help or hinder her own spiritual journey?"" he asked. ""Why would I be more comfortable with pastors and not Christian academics creating this document? Because orthodoxy divorced from relationships can many times lead to rhetoric that hinders (not helps) us achieve our overall mission, to lead all people to Jesus,"" he said.

""I don't disagree with the document. I disagree with the tone in which it was presented. I disagree with the vacuum within which it was created, and I disagree with the rhetoric this will now create that will only further drive a wedge between evangelical Christians and the LGBT community.""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/nashville-statement-is-biblical-but-lacks-pastoral-wisdom-further-alienates-lgbt-persons-scholars-198029/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
2304,2639,High School Removes Church Banner From Football Stadium After Atheist Group's Complaint,"(Photo: FFRF.org) A church banner hangs outside the football stadium at New Palestine High School in New Palestine, Indiana.

An Indiana public school district has removed a banner advertising a local church from a high school football stadium after the nation's largest secularist legal group filed a complaint.

The Freedom From Religion Foundation, a Wisconsin-based group that advocates for a strict separation of church and state and often pressures public schools and government agencies, has announced that school officials at New Palestine High School have removed a banner advertising for Realife Church in Greenfield.

The banner in question featured the team's logo and stated in big lettering at the top, ""I can do all things..."" — an abbreviated version of Philippians 4:13.

The banner also featured the words ""RealLifeChurch.com"" and the church's logo in the bottom left hand corner and the words ""Dragon Football"" in the bottom right hand corner.

The school district's decision to remove the banner comes after FFRF sent a demand letter to Lisa Lantrip, the superintendent of the Community School Corporation of Southern Hancock County, on Dec. 5 to explain that the organization had been contacted by a local event attendee concerned by the banner.

The letter claimed that advertising for a church on school property was a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, even if the banner is a paid advertisement.

""Students and parents will understand that the high school endorses this banner and its religious message, given its prominent placement, team logo, and the words ""Dragon Football,"" FFRF attorney Ryan Jayne wrote in the letter. ""Palestine High School may not decorate its stadium with religious displays or church advertisements. We request that this banner be removed.""

Jayne's letter cited Supreme Court rulings, such as its decision in Stone v. Graham, a 1980 case in which the court struck down a Kentucky law requiring the Ten Commandments to be placed on the walls of every public school classroom.

""Messages that are affixed to school walls, or in this case, the outside of the school's stadium, are attributable to the school. Such messages are government speech, not private speech,"" Jayne asserted. ""It makes no difference if the church message is paid advertising. Given the banner size, prominent location, and inclusion of the school logo and name of the school's football team, the banner is plainly attributable to the school and must not include religious messages or promote places of worship.""

According to an FFRF press release issued last week, it didn't take long for Lantrip to respond to Jayne's letter.

FFRF reports that Lantrip sent an email, explaining that the banner in question had been taken down.

""The district did the right thing by taking down a divisive religious message,"" FFRF Co-President Annie Laurie Gaylor said in a statement. ""Sporting events should unite the district community, not alienate certain members.""

According to The Greenfield Daily Reporter, the banner's placement at the football stadium was the inspiration of Lead Pastor Rev. Adam Detamore, who approached the school months ago with the idea for the banner and presented officials with the design of the banner.

Detamore said that the words ""I can do all things"" were picked for the banner because it provided a motivational message of ""Let's go get them; let's do it."" He added that the phrase is often used by Christian NBA star Steph Curry.

""[The school's decision] does not change that we want to invest in the school and serve them,"" Detamore explained. ""We have a great relationship with the school. Our intention behind the banner was simply to show support and love for our community.""

Although many government agencies and school districts cave when pressured by groups like FFRF, some put up a fight. Most recently, a town in Florida has taken steps to prepare itself for a potential lawsuit that could arise from its refusal to remove a cross from a veterans memorial.

Earlier this month, the city council of town of Vero Beach voted to accept free legal services from the Liberty Counsel, a national religious freedom legal group, after it received a complaint from FFRF over a 19-inch cross sitting atop the city's ""Lest We Forget"" monument.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/high-school-removes-church-banner-from-football-stadium-after-atheist-groups-complaint-210546/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
2305,2640,Atheist Group Slammed by Louisiana Sheriff After Forcing Removal of Christian Facebook Posts,"(Photo: Facebook/Washington Parish Sheriff's Office) Sheriff Randy Seal of Washington Parish Louisiana.

A Louisiana sheriff has ""set the record straight"" on his reluctant decision to recently remove Bible references from his office's public Facebook page and labeled the atheist organization that pressured him to do so as being a fringe ""extremist group.""

Washington Parish Sheriff Randy ""Country"" Seal wrote in a Facebook Saturday that he made his decision to remove Facebook posts that mentioned Bible verses and also promoted Christian holidays such as Easter and Christmas from the office's Facebook page because the department simply doesn't have the money to fight a costly legal battle with one of the largest secular legal groups in the country.

The Freedom From Religion Foundation, a Wisconsin-based group that often pressures schools and government entities to adhere to a strict separation of church and state, demanded that the Washington Parish Sheriff's Office remove the Facebook posts in a letter sent to Seal last year that also complained about Seal promoting Christianity in his official statements as sheriff.

Last week, FFRF claimed victory when it reported how the Christian-themed Facebook posts in question were removed from the sheriff's office Facebook page.

""A recent decision by me in my official capacity as Sheriff is being touted as a victory for the ardently anti-Christian Freedom from Religion Foundation (FFRF). I want to set the record straight. It could not be further from the truth,"" Seal wrote in his Facebook post. ""Based on sound legal advice and being mindful of the possibility of a long and expensive legal fight, I directed that all Bible verses be removed from the official Facebook pages of the Washington Parish Sheriff's Office.""

Seal continued by criticizing the Freedom From Religion Foundation, which argues that Christian-themed posts on the social media pages of public entities is a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.

""The Freedom from Religion Foundation continues to attack and threaten small towns and average Americans for exercising their constitutional freedoms,"" Seal posted. ""This well-funded but fringe, extremist group has sued to remove 'In God We Trust' from United States currency; sued to remove the Star of David from a Holocaust memorial and sued Presidents Bush and President Obama for holding a National Day of Prayer.""

FFRF has also pressured college football coaches and even a United States senator to refrain from promoting Bible verses and Christianity on their social media pages.

""Groups like the FFRF have sued to remove the Ground Zero Cross at the 9/11 memorial museum, claiming their members experienced symptoms of depression, headaches, anxiety, and mental pain and anguish,"" Seal added. ""One of FFRF's slogans is 'Nothing fails like prayer.' The reality is their threatening letters have caused many agencies to cave for fear of being forced to pay for the expense of defending against even a frivolous lawsuit. We are no different. The Washington Parish Sheriff's Office simply cannot afford the cost of defending a lawsuit of this nature.""

Seal concluded by stating that his office's mission is to enforce the law and protect its citizens.

""Under my tenure as Sheriff of Washington Parish we have worked hard to improve the quality of life for residents of Washington Parish. My family and I love Washington Parish. It is our home. It is an honor to serve as your Sheriff,"" he wrote. ""My belief that Jesus is my Lord and Savior has not changed!!""

Seal told The Christian Post through Facebook that he plans to formally respond to CP's request for comment on the matter by no later than Tuesday.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/atheist-group-ffrf-louisiana-sheriff-removal-christian-facebook-posts-213680/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
2306,2641,Ten Reasons Parents Should Subscribe to Pure Flix -- The Family-Friendly ‘Christian Netflix’,"Movies, documentaries, and TV series don't need to be riddled with sex, violence, and inappropriate language to be entertaining. Instead, as the success of films like “God’s Not Dead,” “Woodlawn” and “War Room” prove, they can captivate audiences while simultaneously uplift, encourage, and inspire them.

However, it seems Hollywood hasn’t quite gotten the memo.

Today, even movies rated “G” and “PG” or touted as “family-friendly” include the kind of content many parents don’t want to put in front of their children. Far too often, parents are forced to grab the remote and hit the “mute” button to protect their children from unexpected sexual innuendo and crude jokes.

To combat this unfortunate reality, PureFlix.com, a streaming video-on-demand service focused on faith and family programming, offers thousands of movies and TV shows that are safe for the whole family.

For parents seeking to give their families a clean, uplifting alternative to much of what Hollywood puts out, PureFlix.com is offering a free one-month trial to its video streaming services with thousands of titles. With access to movies and shows ranging from classics like ""The Little Rascals"" and ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" to newer titles including ""Woodlawn"" and ""God's Not Dead 2"", there's an option for every taste and interest.

Here are nine reasons parents should subscribe to PureFlix.com -- the family-friendly, Christian alternative to Netflix.

Exposure to Media is Unavoidable - Why Not Make it a Positive Experience?

Like it or not, exposure to mass media is unavoidable. From online platforms like YouTube to movies, streaming services, and TV, we live in a culture irreversibly saturated by screens.

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics website, children between the ages of 2 and 18 spend an average of three hours each day watching television -- and the influence of media on the psychosocial development of little ones is profound. It’s estimated that by age 18, a U.S. youth will have seen 16,000 simulated murders and 200,000 acts of violence. Additionally, the more sexual content that kids see on television, the earlier they initiate sexual activity.

Like other popular streaming services, PureFlix.com started in 2015, offers a wide variety of choices ranging from action movies and romantic dramas to comedy series. Yet, PureFlix.com’s goal is unique in that it aims to provide a wholesome viewing experience for your entire family that is fun, entertaining, inspirational, and even educational.

What Your Children Watch Will Impact Their Values

For better or worse, media has an enormous impact on our children’s values, beliefs, and behaviors. Statistics show that kids who view violent acts on TV are more likely to show aggressive behavior and may become less sensitive to the pain and suffering of others.

It’s clear that paying attention to what our kids are exposed to via technology is of the utmost importance. Be intentional with your media consumption. Philippians 4:8 puts it this way: ""Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things are noble, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy—meditate on these things.""

The options available at PureFlix.com prove that reinforcing positive behavior to your children via technology is not only possible, it’s incredibly easy. The family-friendly and Christian movies and TV shows available on PureFlix.com are accessible online or on your mobile phone, tablet, Roku, Apple TV, or Amazon Fire TV.

Movie Night Allows You to Spend Time as a Family

Because every option on PureFlix.com is safe for the whole family, movie nights are made easy.

Instead of being exposed to content that contradicts Biblical values, your family will enjoy wholesome films with storylines, themes, and characters you can trust.

Setting aside time for your family on a regular basis lets them know just how much they mean to you. Some great, family-friendly options for movie night include Amazing Love starring “Lord of the Rings” actor Sean Astin; Midrange, an intimate portrait of how one aspiring basketball star is suddenly forced to re-examine his life, loyalty, love, and his own limitations; and Woodlawn, the real-life story of how one gifted high school football player learns to embrace his talent and his faith as he battles racial tensions on and off the field.

Family movie night also has positive effects on married couples, as spending time with your spouse may result in better intimacy and increased communication. Watching movies with your loved ones is not only an enjoyable activity for everyone, it also strengthens family bonds in a powerful way.

PureFlix Offers Options to Reinforce Family Values and Spark Important Conversations

What sort of message is the entertainment in your house passing on to your children? As earlier noted, from YouTube to TV and movies, media has a strong and undeniable impact on children’s thoughts, beliefs, and behavior. Estimates are that by the age of 17, the average child will have consumed 65,000 hours of media, compared to about 11,000 hours that the child will spend in school and more than 32 times the number of hours they will spend with a parent.

PureFlix.com is a clean, Christian video streaming service that only carries films and shows that will reinforce your family’s Christ-centered values. Films like Healed by Grace, I’m Not Ashamed, or God’s Not Dead 2, will allow you to talk to your children about how characters handled fictional situations and spark important conversations. PureFlix.com makes it easy to watch movies that tell tales of heroism, self-sacrifice, bravery, and kindness, thus instilling those values in your kids.

In a society inundated with negativity, it’s important to make sure that television and movies support your family’s ideals.

PureFlix Provides Movies, Documentaries, and TV Series That are Both Entertaining and High-Quality

In the past, Christians have complained about the quality of faith-based entertainment -- but that’s all changing. The facts speak for themselves: the Pure Flix box office film “God’s Not Dead” grossed $62 million on a $2 million dollar budget, proving it is possible to make quality, uplifting films suitable for the whole family.

It’s undeniable: Christian movies aren’t what they used to be -- and that’s a good thing; for the most part, faith-based entertainment no longers sacrifices quality for the message. PureFlix believes in infiltrating culture and bringing light to dark places, and they’ll continue to do exactly that through quality, Christ-centered entertainment.

PureFlix Allows You to Control Entertainment Messages

We’ve all been there. It’s family movie night, and you’re cuddled on the couch with your loved ones and a big bowl of popcorn, eager to watch a film you’ve been waiting months to see. Of course, the film was touted as “family friendly” and rated PG, so you assumed your family would be safe.

Ten minutes into the film, you find yourself awkwardly reaching for the remote, blushing at the sexual innuendo casually thrown out by the protagonist. You’re disappointed, embarrassed, and frustrated.

With many entertainment options, parents never know what they’re going to see next. Unfortunately, even exhaustive research and careful combing of movie reviews isn’t enough to protect your family from exposure to unwanted content.

With your free one-month trial to PureFlix.com, you can easily find wholesome films with content you can trust -- they’ve already done all the research for you. Thanks to PureFlix, you not only have access to thousands of movies and TV shows completely free, you don’t have to worry about your children being exposed to damaging entertainment.

PureFlix Provides Educational, Biblically-Sound Options for Children

There are plenty of educational children’s movies and documentaries out there -- unfortunately, many of them promote ideas or values that contradict the Bible, from evolution to issues of gender and sexuality identity.

Pureflix.com provides a number of documentaries, movies, and series that are both educational and entertaining. From a fascinating, in-depth documentary about Abraham Lincoln to live science experiments, these options will reinforce what your children are learning in a fun way.

For the homeschooling family, PureFlix.com provides plenty of options to complement your homeschool curriculum. There’s an entire section of films based on books that are truly safe for everyone in your family, from the youngest to the eldest member.

Learning can and should be fun!

The best part -- all of these options are not only educational, they seek to change our culture for Christ.

Hollywood Won’t Change Unless the Church Gets Involved

For decades, Hollywood has exerted powerful moral, cultural, and political influences on our society. Unfortunately, many of the values touted by Hollywood through film and television directly contradict those of the Church. As biblical principles continue to disappear from Hollywood, so do uplifting, faith-based films.

However, this wasn’t always the case; in the 1930s, '40s and '50s, the Church heavily influenced the movie-making industry. In the early '60s, however, the Church pulled out of Hollywood - and the meteoric rise in sex and violence seen in movies since then is undeniable. According to a 2016 study by the Parents Television Council, ""The amount and intensity of adult content on TV-PG shows is increasing, yet the TV-PG rating does not reflect these changes. Consequently, children are exposed to more adult content, even when parents choose TV-PG rated programs.”

It’s time for the Church to once again get involved.

Now more than ever, we need to support uplifting and Christian movies so that biblical principles stay in the popular media and in the entertainment we all consume on a daily basis. By actively engaging in the film and television industry instead of avoiding or condemning it, Christians can have a powerful voice - and can challenge the view that they are a small market.

PureFlix.com CEO Greg Gudorf puts it this way: ""For so long, the Church has warned against the dangers of media and preached that we should move away from it. But, our human nature is we're hooked, we're addicted. You can tell an addict it's not good for them, but unless you show the addict an alternative, it becomes difficult. Of course, the Church has got the best alternative in the simple words of Jesus Christ Himself. In the media world, we want to make sure those messages come through.""

2309,2645,Pure Flix Movie List: Ten Free Films and Original Series Impacting Culture for Christ,"Pure Flix, the faith-based entertainment production and distribution company founded in Scottsdale, Arizona, has a simple mission: influence culture, inspire the human spirit, and share the gospel of Jesus Christ by providing positive and uplifting entertainment safe for the whole family.

And they’ve done exactly that. Since 2005, the company has produced, distributed, and acquired thousands of Christ centered movies, documentaries and TV series, including the $60 million-grossing film ""God's Not Dead.""

In 2015, Pure Flix launched a streaming video services, PureFlix.com, which like Netflix and Hulu, offers the first month free and gives viewers the option to choose from thousands of titles without paying a fee. Unlike other popular streaming services, however, PureFlix.com screens every documentary, family sitcom, and inspirational short film offered to ensure it’s safe for the whole family.

We live in a sight and sound culture -- and like it or not, exposure to screens is unavoidable. Statistics show that on average, American adults are watching five hours and four minutes of television per day. About 50 percent of Americans now have subscription services like Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu in their homes, and that number is only increasing.

In turn, children aged five to 16 spend an average of six and a half hours a day in front of a screen compared with around three hours in 1995, according to market research firm Childwise. Estimates are that by the age of 17, the average child will have consumed 65,000 hours of media, whether it’s watching TV, playing games consoles, using a mobile, computer or tablet.

Research has also shown that better or worse, media has an enormous impact on our -- and our children’s -- values, beliefs, and behaviors. Children who view violent acts on TV are more likely to show aggressive behavior and may become less sensitive to the pain and suffering of others. Additionally, the more sexual content that kids see on television, the earlier they initiate sexual activity.

The message is clear: filling your kids’ heads with positive and uplifting content is of the utmost importance. Because 100% of the content available on PureFlix.com is a clean, safe alternative to much of what Hollywood puts out, monitoring your family’s media consumption is made easy. Instead of grabbing the remote to skip over scenes filled with sexual innuendo, violence, and inappropriate language, you’ll be able to sit back, relax, and enjoy Christ-centered entertainment with the whole family.

Following a free, 30-day trial, the Pure Flix streaming service is available for $10.99/month or an annual subscription at $99.99. They’re always adding new titles, too, so your family will never get bored. Films and other programs can be streamed through your computer, tablet, smartphone, and many TV extensions like Roku, Apple TV, and Google Chromecast.

The following is a list of 10 movies and original Pure Flix series that families can enjoy together on PureFlix.com for free during the trial period.

In other words, if you continually fill your head with sexually explicit, violent and negative material through TV, movies or the Internet, your actions, thoughts, and beliefs will soon reflect that.

2337,2681,Netherlands May Debate Law Allowing Anyone Healthy 75 Years or Older to Choose Euthanasia,"(Photo: Reuters/Shannon Stapleton)

In the Netherlands, it may soon be legal for healthy people to choose to be euthanized provided they are old enough, according to proposed legislation.

The ""Completed Life Bill,"" which might be introduced into the Dutch parliament by Pia Dijkstra, a member of Dutch D66 political party, allows any person aged 75 or over to decide that his or her life is ""complete"" and receive euthanasia drugs, The Federalist reported Friday.

Julie Hocker, senior policy fellow for the Center for Human Dignity at the American Conservative Union Foundation, explained in a Monday interview with The Christian Post that with the proposal of this bill the Dutch continue opening some very troubling doors.

""Once death is a solution for one 'problem,' it soon becomes the solution for many more,"" Hocker said. ""Perhaps even worse, it becomes the obligation to choose death as the correct, binary choice to remaining a so-called burden on families.""

Advocates for euthanasia have employed strict ""physician assisted suicide"" statutes around the world for ""supposed last resort deaths"" as a ""wedge"" in order to promote a much more nefarious ""death-on-demand"" agenda, she said.

She believes the United States should take warning here and pointed out that in states where assisted suicide has gained ground some troubling phenomena have appeared.

""As dignity is stripped of some individuals, we will see whole communities suffer. Look to Oregon — the first state in the U.S. to legalize physician-assisted suicide — suicide rates continue to climb while funding for prevention continues to dry up; among teenagers, suicide is the second leading cause of death now,"" Hocker said.

""And we cannot be surprised: a 2015 survey published in the Southern Medical Journal found that the legalization of Physician Assisted Suicide led to a direct increase in suicides overall. Supposed 'Death with Dignity' laws are being aggressively marketed as compassionate — and as Americans, we need to realize they are anything but that.""

Expand | Collapse (Photo: The Christian Post/Brandon Showalter) Julie Hocker of the American Conservative Union and Stan Swim of the GFC Foundation speak at a breakout session on the dangers of assisted suicide at CPAC at the Gaylord National Convention Center in National Harbor, Maryland, February 24, 2017.

Under the guise of ""compassion,"" society ""tosses aside the vulnerable, the frail, and the sick by creating a growing class of citizens deemed better off dead,"" she added.

As it stands, the following states have adopted assisted suicide legislation: Oregon, Washington, Vermont, California, Colorado and Washington, D.C. In Montana, a court ruling has legalized the practice there.

Although numbers remain relatively small, the assisted suicide rate has risen dramatically since its legalization in the Netherlands in 2002 for the terminally ill.

""In 2016, there were 6,091 reported instances of euthanasia in the Netherlands. Of those, 141 were for patients with dementia. That is up from 12 such cases in 2009. Also for patients with chronic psychiatric illness, there were 0 instances of euthanasia in 2009, but by 2016 that number had risen to 60,"" The Federalist reported.

The D66 party is one of the smaller yet politically effective progressive Dutch parties whose leader, Alexander Pechtold, regards the right to die when one so chooses as an ""individual consideration"" and a positive advance.

When asked to elaborate on his views on a Dutch TV show in March, Pechtold said that he favored an incremental approach to this and that his colleague, Pia Dijkstra, ""can now continue persuading parliament and the country to — in my own words and personal opinion — take the next step for our civilization.""

He further maintained that broad political support for euthanizing completely healthy people exists and that he hopes that eventually people younger than 75 can opt to end their lives when they want, though a lower age is not feasible at the moment.

Since no party ever wins a majority in the Dutch parliament, coalitions must be made in order to form a functioning government. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the center-right People's Party for Freedom and Democracy, who won re-election earlier this year, is now in negotiations with D66 and two Christian political parties, both of whom oppose the proposed ""Completed Life Bill."" If he forms a coalition with D66, the Completed Life bill will likely be placed on the legislative agenda and it may indeed pass.

Yet in recent months, some troubling developments have emerged such that even euthanasia supporters are expressing concerns publicly.

The Christian Post reported in February that a Dutch doctor was cleared of wrongdoing after administering lethal drugs to an 80-year-old woman suffering from dementia who had reportedly expressed second thoughts about wanting to die. The process included putting a sedative in her coffee unbeknownst to her and when she was injected with the drugs to kill her the doctor ordered her family members to hold her down in order to complete the procedure because her body began resisting death.

This incident led some who endorse the practice to admit how things have gone awry.

In February, a group of 220 doctors took out an ad in Dutch newspaper NRC to voice their refusal to administer euthanasia drugs to patients suffering from advanced dementia since such people cannot verbally consent to it. In a detailed editorial in NRC in June, Boudewijn Chabot, a psychogeriatrician who supports assisted suicide, said that the practice of euthanasia ""is out of control"" and cited the gradual erosion of key legal constraints over time.

""I do not see how we get the genie back into the bottle. It would be a lot if we recognize that he is gone,"" Chabot said in his editorial, originally in Dutch, translated by CP.

Hocker believes it is important not to lose focus on the larger picture.

Euthanasia advocates ""are not looking to stop at narrow pieces of legislation,"" Hocker said.

""They seek a society where humans are discarded instead of helped, loved, and valued for their intrinsic worth,"" she reiterated.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/netherlands-may-debate-law-allowing-anyone-healthy-75-years-or-older-to-choose-euthanasia-190603/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
2338,2682,New Zealand University Students Vote to Disaffiliate Pro-Life Student Group,"(Photo: Facebook/The University of Auckland) The University of Auckland, located in New Zealand.

Students at a university in New Zealand have voted in an online referendum to disaffiliate a pro-life student group, stripping the organization of its official recognition.

Last week, a majority of students from the University of Auckland voted to have the group, ProLife Auckland, disaffiliate from the Auckland University Students Association.

As a result, it will be harder for ProLife Auckland to receive funding for operations and on-campus room reservations.

The final vote tally was about 1,600 students in favor of disaffiliation and about 1,000 against, according to the Auckland City Harbour News.

""This was the first successful disaffiliation attempt on the group, which had faced the ban several times since its inception in 2010,"" reported the ACHN on Monday.

""AUSA affiliation was largely a symbolic acknowledgement from the student community that it wishes to be associated with that particular organisation.""

According to their website, AUSA uses referenda as a way for students at the university to engage with the student government on various issues.

""AUSA Online Referenda will be one of the ways you can have your say through AUSA. It's a direct online vote which every University of Auckland student can use,"" noted the AUSA.

""You'll be voting on referenda questions posed by students, and we encourage you to submit referenda questions of your own!""

For a referenda question to be binding, it must have at least 3 percent of the AUSA members vote on it, as well as not concern finance, administration, human resources or governance.

The specific wording of the referenda question on ProLife Auckland was ""Should AUSA disaffiliate the Pro Life Club and ban any clubs with similar ideology from affiliating in the future?""

The campus group Auckland Students For Choice celebrated the result of the vote, stating in a Facebook post that they were ""pleased and heartened"" by the disaffiliation.

""This is a clear message to anti-choice activists and proponents that their views do not represent the views of the student body,"" said the pro-choice group.

ProLife Auckland Co-President Jelena Middleton said in a statement posted to the group's Facebook page on Monday that the vote result was ""unjust"" as well as ""legally dubious.""

""It's doubtful that such an unjust process and outcome would be tolerated in any other sector of a free and open society like New Zealand,"" said Middleton. ""We are now seeking legal advice about the legality of this action and how it may have breached the NZ Bill of Rights.""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/new-zealand-university-students-vote-disaffiliate-pro-life-student-group-197348/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
2339,2683,New Zealand Removes Jesus' Name From Parliament Prayer,"(Photo: REUTERS/Ana Nicolaci da Costa) A police car is seen in front of the parliament building in Wellington, New Zealand, September 21, 2017.

The parliament of the increasingly secular nation of New Zealand has removed a reference to Jesus Christ in a new version of a prayer that is said before the start of every sitting session.

Radio New Zealand reported on Thursday that Speaker of the House Trevor Mallard has already started using the new version despite the period of consultation not yet being over.

The original version of the prayer read:

""Almighty God, humbly acknowledging our need for Thy guidance in all things, and laying aside all private and personal interests, we beseech Thee to grant that we may conduct the affairs of this House and of our country to the glory of Thy holy name, the maintenance of true religion and justice, the honor of the Queen, and the public welfare, peace, and tranquility of New Zealand, through Jesus Christ our Lord.""

Beside dropping Jesus' name, the new version also removes references to Britain's queen, who acts as Supreme Governor of the Church of England.

""Almighty God, we give thanks for the blessings which have been bestowed on New Zealand,"" the proposed new prayer reads. ""Laying aside all personal interests, we pray for guidance in our deliberations, that we may conduct the affairs of this House with wisdom and humility, for the public welfare and peace of New Zealand.""

An even more ""radical change"" to the prayer was also presented before members of the parliament that removed all religious references, but was not accepted.

Jacinda Ardern, an agnostic, was sworn in as New Zealand's 40th Prime Minister in a non-religious ceremony in October, becoming the youngest woman to lead the country at 37 years of age.

Ardern reportedly did not include the phrase ""so help me God"" in her oath of office, and replaced the word ""swear"" with ""solemnly, sincerely, and truly declare and affirm.""

Ardern told the New Zealand Herald in an interview that she was raised in a Mormon family, but left the church in her early 20s after she couldn't reconcile her support for her gay friends with conservative positions on marriage.

Newshub reported earlier this year that while a century ago New Zealand was one of the most Christian nations in the world, national census data from 2013 found that less than half the population, or 48.9 percent, now identify with the faith.

""Historically, religion flourished among what we would call middle income people, the middle classes. Now today, that's the area of tremendous decline in religiosity,"" Massey University professor Peter Lineham said at the time.

Lineham added that Asian immigrants, such as Koreans and Filipinos who come to New Zealand, are often ""alarmed"" at how secular the nation is.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/new-zealand-removes-jesus-name-parliament-prayer-206034/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
2340,2684,"Charlie Gard Has Died in Hospice After Experimental Treatment Denied, Life Support Removed","(Photo: REUTERS/Peter Nicholls) Charlie Gard's parents Coonie Yates and Chris Gard arrive at the High Court ahead of a hearing on their baby's future, in London, Britain July 24, 2017.

LONDON — Charlie Gard, a British baby who became the subject of a bitter dispute between his parents and doctors over whether he should be taken to the United States for experimental treatment, has died, the Daily Mail newspaper's website said on Friday.

The 11-month-old baby suffered from an extremely rare genetic condition causing progressive brain damage and muscle weakness, and his parents' long struggle to save him drew an international outpouring of sympathy.

Parents denied right to take Charlie home

A British judge gave the parents of Charlie Gard until noon on Thursday to agree on arrangements for his death with the hospital caring for him. If no agreement is made, the baby would be transferred to a hospice where his ventilation tube would be removed.

The 11-month-old baby, who suffers from an extremely rare genetic condition causing progressive brain damage and muscle weakness, has been the subject of a bitter dispute between his parents and Great Ormond Street Hospital in London.

The case has triggered a heated international debate in the press and on social media about who should decide a child's fate, and has drawn comment from U.S. President Donald Trump and Pope Francis.

Having reluctantly taken the decision over the weekend to let Charlie die, his parents have been making desperate attempts to make an arrangement that would make it possible for them to spend several days with him, away from the hospital.

Charlie requires invasive ventilation to breathe and cannot see, hear or swallow.

At stake in this final, agonizing part of the legal dispute is how long Connie Yates and Chris Gard will have with their son before he dies.

The parents tried for several days to gain permission to take their son home, but as Wednesday's court hearing progressed it became clear that would not happen because the logistical problems were insurmountable.

The parents had made clear that if they could not take Charlie home, they would prefer him to die in a hospice rather than in the hospital, where he has spent most of his life.

But a lawyer for Charlie's court-appointed guardian told the court that no hospice could provide care for intensively ventilated children for a long time, so the parents' wish to spend several days with him could not be fulfilled.

The parents have been trying to find a doctor willing to oversee a plan that would allow Charlie to be ventilated in a hospice for several days. It was to give them a final chance of making such an arrangement that the judge gave them until noon on Thursday.

""Unless by 12 noon tomorrow the parents and the guardian and the hospital can agree an alternative arrangement, Charlie will be transferred to a hospice and extubated shortly after,"" said Nicholas Francis, the judge presiding over the case.

Mother in Tears

An alternative arrangement appears unlikely, given the total breakdown in relations between the parents and the hospital.

The judge ordered that the name of the hospice and the exact timing of Charlie's last moments should not be disclosed to the public.

At one point, Yates shouted in court, apparently at Charlie's guardian: ""What if it was your child? I hope you are happy with yourself."" She then left the courtroom in tears.

At the start of the hearing, the parents' lawyer, Grant Armstrong, had said they had found a doctor who could help them.

But the guardian's lawyer, Victoria Butler-Cole, later said the person in question was a general medical doctor with no experience of intensive care, and that he had not identified any hospice willing to undertake intensive care for a long period.

Butler-Cole said the parents should spend the last few days of Charlie's life with him, not with their lawyers.

The dispute first made headlines months ago, when Charlie's parents wanted to take him to the United States to undergo experimental treatment.

The Great Ormond Street doctors said it would not help and would only prolong the baby's suffering. British courts, backed by the European Court of Human Rights, refused permission, saying the parents' plan was not in Charlie's best interests.

The parents gave up the legal battle on Monday, saying that the latest scans showed Charlie's condition had deteriorated to the point that no recovery was possible. But they remain convinced that the treatment might have helped Charlie had he received it months ago.

The hospital disagrees. It says Charlie had suffered irreversible brain damage by January as a result of a series of seizures, and his responsiveness has not changed since then.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/charlie-gard-has-died-hospice-experimental-treatment-denied-life-support-removed-193594/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

The parents of an 18-month-old boy who is suffering from a mystery brain condition are in a legal battle with a hospital in Britain that wants to switch off the child's life support, saying they can do nothing more for him.

Thomas Evans and Kate James want to move their child, Alfie Evans, to a hospital in Italy that is willing to take him, but Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool opposes the move as not in the child's best interests, according to The Sunday Times.

Alfie, who was admitted to the hospital last December, is in a coma and suffers regular seizures, and the hospital has urged the High Court to rule that long-term ventilation and intensive care to the child be withdrawn.

Test results showing two mitochondrial gene variants suggest Alfie could suffer from a form of mitochondrial disease like the one that killed Charlie Gard, a British baby who became the subject of a bitter dispute during the summer between his parents and doctors over whether he should be taken to the United States for experimental treatment, according to Liverpool Echo.

""It's devastating — we feel so disappointed,"" the child's father is quoted as saying. ""I feel Alfie is being ignored, let down and not given a chance.""

He added, ""The doctors here are saying it's a disease he is not going to live through, but Alfie is a fighter and we will not give up on him. On New Year's Eve they told us he only had a couple of hours to live, but Alfie proved them wrong and I know he will prove them wrong again. We call him our little soldier and as long as he is marching, we are marching with him. I will never ever agree to turn his life support off.""

The parents have launched a campaign to raise about $67,000, and thousands have responded.

The 11-month-old Charlie Gard suffered from an extremely rare genetic condition causing progressive brain damage and muscle weakness, and his parents' long struggle to save him drew an international outpouring of sympathy. The child required invasive ventilation to breathe and could not see, hear or swallow.

The case triggered a heated international debate in the press and on social media about who should decide a child's fate, and drew comments from U.S. President Donald Trump and Pope Francis.

American pro-life leaders raised their voices in support of Charlie Gard, decrying the decision by European courts that a London hospital had the authority to withdraw life support against the wishes of his parents.

""Every life is a gift and worth fighting for, and we plan to do everything in our power to be a voice and to protect the inherent dignity of little Charlie Gard,"" said Jeanne Mancini, president of March for Life, in July. ""Our hearts go out to the Gard family and we hope that their wishes for Charlie to be released and to seek alternative medical treatment will soon be respected.""

Catherine Glenn Foster, president and CEO of Americans United for Life, the legal arm of the pro-life movement in the United States, told The Christian Post at the time that the court ruling ""does not require the hospital to remove care; it simply allows them and gives them the authority to.""

Thirty-seven members of the European parliament also signed a letter to British Prime Minister Theresa May and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, writing that they felt ""obliged to voice our deepest concerns about the outrageous outcome of Charlie's case, which infringes Europe's most fundamental values, particularly the right to life, the right to human dignity and personal integrity.""

Christian churches in Syria are crying out for help and assistance amid deadly attacks by Turkish forces on Kurdish areas of the civil war ravaged nation.

Churches in Afrin are calling on the international community not to ignore their plight as they face ""great danger from Turkey and its jihadist alliance,"" which began a military campaign in the Afrin region last week on grounds that Kurdish militias pose a ""security"" threat.

As clashes between Syrian Democratic Forces and Turkish-led forces that include allied militant factions have taken place throughout the region over the last several days, thousands of civilians have fled their homes and a number have been killed as a result of the conflict.

The violence is also impacting religious minorities in the region, such as Yazidis and Christians, who have experienced a level of religious freedom under the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria that advocates say is not enjoyed by religious minorities living in other parts of the Middle East.

""As the leaders of the Christian churches in North Syria, in the town of Afrin we hereby confirm that we are under attack by Turkey,"" an open letter from Pastor Hakim Ali Ismael, senior pastor of a network of churches in Afrin and Kobane, to international leaders reads. ""The lives of our women and children are in danger. The city of Afrin is being bombarded by Turkish airstrikes. We are asking for intervention, and protection against the violent attacks which are being levied against use at the moment.""

""Many lives are in mortal danger,"" the letter, which was shared with The Christian Post, reads. ""We are requesting aid and assistance. We are unable to protect ourselves or our families against these attacks, neither are we able to offer assistance or shelter the innocents.""

According to the letter, there are more than 200 Christian families that live in the Afrin area.

Afrin is an isolated part of the Syrian federation that borders areas controlled by Islamist rebels and the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

In Afrin, evangelical Christianity had steadily grown over the past several years, according to Johannes de Jong, the director of the European Christian think tank Sallux who has worked with Syriac Christians since the rise of the Islamic State in 2014.

""[I]t is only since the beginning of the civil war that these churches started to grow. This was also possible as the Federation of Northern Syria realized full freedom of religion which allowed the public establishment of churches and missionary work,"" de Jong told CP on Tuesday. ""[Ninety-five percent] of the believers have a Muslim background so almost all church members are converts to Christianity. There are at least three Christian congregations in the various parts of Afrin. The largest congregation consists of approximately 200 families.""

Turkey began its attack on the area last week on the grounds that the People's Protection Units, the Kurdish militia in Syria also known as YPG, is a terrorist group that threatens the NATO country's security.

De Jong, however, points out that YPG is part of the Syrian Democratic Forces that worked with the United States-led fight against the Islamic State.

""What we are hearing from these Kurdish churches in Afrin is that they have to sleep in basements out of fear of bombings,"" de Jong said. ""Some are hiding in the mountains. I am getting quite terrible pictures. It is clearly a threat to the freedom of these Christian communities. The existence of these Christian communities is really under threat. As Christians, they simply know what will be coming for them if these al Qaeda-type of militias take over the area.""

De Jong expressed concern that terrorist outfits such as the al Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front are involved in the Turkish attack on Afrin.

""The Turkish outlet 'Cumhuriyet Gazetesi' published these pictures of the Turkish allies in the Afrin operation. Thanks to that we now have evidence that al-Qaeda is part of the Turkish-backed militias that are part of the invasion in Afrin,"" de Jong explained in an email. ""The intention of these pictures is to show the Turkish allies. The man [in photo No. 21 on the website] wears a [bandana] of Al Nusra. [It is] undisputed is that al-Nusra is al-Qaeda in Syria. It is unbelievable that such a threat is supported by anyone at all.""

On Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis urged Turkey to use restraint in its operations in Syria.

""This could be exploited by ISIS and al-Qaeda, obviously, that we're not staying focused on them right now. And obviously it risks exacerbating the humanitarian crisis that most of Syria is going through,"" Mattis told reporters during his trip to Indonesia.

Mattis' comment comes after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Monday that ""We recognize and fully appreciate Turkey's legitimate right to protect its own citizens from terrorist elements.

De Jong criticized Tillerson's remark and called on American Christians to stand up and urge the U.S. government to take action to stop the Turkish operation in Afrin.

""We hear Rex Tillerson speaking about Kurdish concerns for their security. Turks are at the same moment using al-Qaeda militias to attack Afrin and these Kurdish Christians are literally crying out for help. What is this?"" de Jong asked. ""What needs to happen now is that U.S. Christians need to stand up and tell the Trump administration that this needs to stop immediately. There is no right to bomb a civilian population. There is no right in any NATO treaty or whatever to indiscriminately bomb civilians.""

""These guys have already said there is no place for Christians. These Kurdish Christians, you can see it in the statements that they make, they know that these jihadists are the real threat for them,"" de Jong continued. ""This is happening right now and the U.S. is allowing it to happen.""

De Jong asserted that if the U.S. wanted to, it could have a military presence in Afrin.

""There is no problem any more to go to Afrin. First of all, the Russians pulled back. That means that airspace is open. The second point is that U.S. forces have already been between the rest of the federation and Afrin. If they can be there once, they can be there again. Russia will not object. Turkey will not really be able to object because they can't directly attack the U.S. and the U.S. could say if they want that they are going after these al-Qaeda guys that are hiding in these areas. Obviously, they will be able to stop the attack in Afrin.""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/christian-churches-under-attack-amid-turkeys-bombardment-syrian-region-214838/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

SAN JOSE — A conservative Christian evangelical has jumped to the front of the race in the first round of Costa Rica's presidential election next month, boosted by his opposition to gay marriage, according to an opinion poll published on Tuesday.

Fabricio Alvarado, a 43-year-old journalist and the only lawmaker from the evangelical National Restoration party, led the survey by the Center for Research and Political Studies (CIEP) at the University of Costa Rica with 17 percent support.

Given the margin of error, he was virtually tied with conservative lawyer Juan Diego Castro, who had the backing of 16 percent of respondents ahead of the Feb. 4 vote.

Coffee-producing Costa Rica, one of the more prosperous and stable countries in Central America, had been ruled by a two-party dynasty until an upset in the 2014 vote that brought to power a center-left academic who had never held elected office.

Antonio Alvarez Desanti, from the traditionally powerful National Liberation Party (PLN), dropped to third with 11 percent support, according to the CIEP study. The poll was based on 1,013 telephone interviews carried out from Jan. 15 to 17 and had a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points.

Some 27 percent of voters were undecided and all 13 candidates were far from the 40 percent minimum needed to win outright in the first round.

Without an outright winner, the two best-placed candidates would head to a runoff in early April.

Castro, who served as security minister in the 1990s, led during the first months of the campaign by promising to tackle corruption and crime. He is running for the small National Integration Party (PIN).

But Alvarado's opposition to a January ruling by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, which called for the legalization of same-sex marriage, helped him to climb 14 percentage points in one month, according to the survey.

Under Costa Rican law, incumbent President Luis Guillermo Solis cannot seek immediate re-election.

Carlos Alvarado, the candidate from Solis' Citizens' Action Party (PAC), had only 6 percent support amid allegations of corruption against the Solis administration.

An Indian pastor says he was attacked by Hindu extremists who dragged him out onto the streets, beat him, and threatened to kill him unless he renounced Jesus Christ for a Hindu monkey deity.

""In those moments when they were kicking and beating me, I felt that even if I die now, the Lord will make the ministry I leave behind fruitful,"" Pastor Karma Oraon told Morning Star News in an article published Monday.

""We are just a few gathering in the name of Jesus. He is our strength.""

The attack occurred while in Harmu village of Ranchi District, Jharkhand state, on Christmas Eve, when 16 or so Hindu radicals attacked a prayer meeting the 34-year-old pastor was leading with others.

The attackers started shouting ""Praise Bajrang Bali,"" referring to the monkey god Hanuman.

""They forcefully dragged me outside when we were in the middle of meditating on the Word of God,"" the pastor explained. ""They spewed many words in extreme foul language and beat me on my chest repeatedly.""

The pastor was physically and verbally abused, with the radicals tearing up his national identification card.

""They slapped me and said, 'You are Oraon? Tell us what you must do, being an Oraon? You should follow the Adivasi [indigenous] religion or this foreign religion?'"" he said.

""They told me, 'Immediately you should give up Christianity and embrace Sarnaism/Sarna [indigenous religions) — if you don't, you will be brutally murdered.""

The pastor's small flock was also told that they and their families will be killed if they practice Christianity and refuse to embrace the indigenous religion.

One of the witnesses, 21-year-old Chotu Munda, was also beaten when he tried to rescue Oraon.

When he later went to report the incident to the police, the officers refused to even register the case.

The pastor has been driven out of the village, but has not lost his faith in Jesus.

""I never had an experience of opposition when I preached Gospel or visited families to pray for the sick. But I seek inspiration from my Lord; people have crossed every limit to humiliate Him and crucify Him, but He patiently bore their torture for my sake, for my sins,"" Oraon said.

""I strongly feel the presence of my Lord Jesus in all this. Had He not granted the strength to endure, I could have never overcome from what happened.""

Morning Star News reported of other cases of violence against Christians in Jharkhand state, with 60 radicals storming a house church on Christmas Day in Behratoli village, trying to force a group of 16 Christians to renounce their religion.

Major church leaders in India had asked the government to provide additional security at houses of worship over Christmas time, given the increased threats that believers face.

Cardinal Baselios Cleemis, president of Catholic Bishops' Conference of India, spoke with Rajnath Singh, the interior minister, earlier in December.

""The minister assured us that immediate action would be taken to bring the culprits to justice and ensure the safety of the community,"" Cleemis said at the time.

Still, he said that many in the minority Christian community in India are ""losing confidence in the government,"" with attacks continuing to rise against them.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/pastor-dragged-beaten-threatened-death-told-renounce-christ-for-hindu-monkey-god-213949/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
2539,2900,Derrick Dillard Responds to Critic: 'My View Is No Different Than Most Americans',"(Photo: Derick Dillard/ Instagram) Derick Dillard and Jill Dillard are pictured in a Thanksgiving photograph posted to Instagram on November 23, 2017.

Derick Dillard said he believes that most Americans share his views on transgenderism.

Dillard, the husband of Jill (Duggar) Dillard who rose to fame on TLC's reality television programs ""19 Kids and Counting"" and ""Counting On,"" reportedly responded to a comment by a critic who disagreed with his views on transgenderism.

One Instagram user named Travelingafar commented on allegations that Dillard was fired from the ""Counting On"" show.

""I'm glad Derick was fired from 'Counting On.' Enough is enough with all of his nonsense,"" user Travelingafar wrote on an unrelated Instagram post of Dillard's.

Dillard responded to the critic by writing, ""My view is no different than most Americans, but I just mentioned it.""

The comments came after several people on social media spoke out against Dillard for referring to TLC's ""I Am Jazz"" star Jazz Jennings by the teenager's male birth gender in a social media post last year, instead of using his preferred gender identity.

""I pity Jazz, 4 those who take advantage of him in order 2 promote their agenda, including the parents who allow these kinds of decisions 2 be made by a child,"" Dillard tweeted last November. ""It's sad that ppl would use a juvenile this way. Again, nothing against him, just unfortunate what's on tv these days.""

TLC subsequently released a statement about Dillard no longer appearing on the ""Counting On"" series, leading many people to infer than he had been fired.

""We want to let our viewers know that Derick Dillard has not participated in 'Counting On' for months and the network has no plans to feature him in the future. We want to reiterate that Derick's personal statements do not reflect the views of the network,"" TLC shared in a statement posted to Twitter in November. ""TLC is proud to share the story of Jazz Jennings and her family and will continue to do so.""

Diillard, the father of two, insisted that he chose to walk away from the network.

""Unbelievable what's considered newsworthy these days, but then again, this is how I first heard that I was 'fired,'"" Dillard tweeted last month. ""For the record, I was never fired.""

The former reality television star said he felt it was best to take his family in another direction.

""I just felt it best for my family to cut ties months ago, as we are heading in a different direction,"" Dillard wrote.

2628,3001,Oscars 2018-Nominated Film Is True Story of Muslims Risking Lives to Save Christians From Radicals,"(Screenshot: YouTube/Derick bartowski) Oscar-nominated film ""Watu Wote"" trailer released in March 2017.

A Kenyan-German short film called ""Watu Wote,"" which depicts the real life story of Muslim passengers risking their lives to save Christians on a bus when Islamic radicals attacked in 2015, has been nominated for an Oscar award.

The full list of Oscar nominations was released earlier this week, with ""Watu Wote"" up for Best Live Action short film at the 90th Academy Awards, which will take place on March 4, as noted by the Clarion Project.

The Christian Post reported on the story that inspired the movie back in December 2015, when Al-Shabaab terror group radicals ambushed a bus in Kenya that was carrying close to 100 people, both Christians and Muslims alike.

The radicals, which earlier that year had killed 152 people at Garissa University College while hunting down specifically Christian students, again attempted to separate the Muslim passengers from the Christian ones, with the intent to kill the latter.

The Muslims stood up for the Christians on the bus, however, with the women sharing their hijabs in order to help them hide. Others directly told the radicals: ""If you want to kill us, then kill us. There are no Christians here.""

Two people still lost their lives in the attack, including one Christian man who tried to run away, and the driver of a truck behind the bus. A much larger slaughter was prevented due to the united actions of the passengers, however.

Christian leaders, including His Exc. Mgr. Joseph Alexander, the bishop of Garissa, praised the Muslims.

""It is a very good thing; a concrete sign that Kenyan Muslims are against violence,"" Alexander said at the time.

""The Shabaab now know that they do not have the support of the Muslim community,"" he added. ""We hope that we continue in this direction because a year ago there was a similar attack that caused a massacre.""

The terror group, based in Somalia, continues carrying out attacks in Kenya, with a number of violent incidents reported in 2017.

The news of ""Watu Wote's"" nomination has been greeted with praise in Kenya, with the country's Film Commission stating on Twitter:

""Truly deserved ! Congrats @Watu_Wote crew, cast and producers from all of us at Kenya Film Commission. We are proud of you.""

Voice of America reported that a German film student produced the film, with Katja Benrath directing the short as part of a graduation project at the Hamburg Media School.

""We felt very good being nominated because this is a huge achievement being nominated, for us, for Germany and for Kenya,"" Benrath said. ""It's just great.""

The director shared her hopes that the film can open up minds.

""I think prejudices are not the right way to live, so I think maybe this movie could help to start again, to look at the next person as a human being and not as a religion you don't like or a culture you don't like,"" she said.

One of the actors, Abdulahi Ahmed, who played the role of one of the radicals, said that the film offers an important message.

""It was hard acting as a terrorist, but the thing is I really wanted to spread the message that Muslims are not allowed to kill Christians and our religion doesn't teach us to kill Christians,"" said Ahmed.

""In our Quran, we are told that our religion does not allow us to kill even an innocent ant without a reason,"" he added, referring to the Islamic holy book.

2629,3002,Simone Biles Reacts to Larry Nassar Sentencing: 'Monster' No Longer Has Power to Steal Our Joy,"(Photo: Reuters/Lucy Nicholson) Simone Biles, the most decorated gymnast in the United States.

Simone Biles has a message for the judge that sentenced former Olympic doctor Larry Nassar to spend the rest of his life in prison after she and over 150 women revealed that he sexually assaulted them.

After seven days of court proceedings, Judge Rosemarie Aquilina of Lansing, Michigan's Ingham County Circuit Court sentenced Nassar, 54, to 40 to 175 years in prison on Wednesday. The sentencing comes after 156 women shared their testimonies of abuse at the hands of Nassar, according to CNN.

Biles took to Twitter to publicly thank the judge and support the survivors involved in the Nassar case.

""To Judge Aquilina : THANK YOU, YOU ARE MY HERO & Shout out to all of the survivors for being so brave & speaking like the queens that you are while looking at that monster,"" the Olympic gymnast wrote Wednesday. ""He will no longer have the power to steal our happiness or joy. I stand with every one of you.""

While Nassar offered apologies to his victims in the courtroom, the judge did not believe he was sincere after the former doctor submitted a letter to the court last week where he alleged that the media was sensationalizing his story and maintained that he was a ""good doctor.""

""Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned,"" Nassar wrote.

The judge expressed her issues with the letter and spoke out against Nassar's lack of accountability.

""This letter tells me you have not yet owned what you did,"" she said. ""You still think somehow you are right, you're a doctor, that you're entitled, so you don't have to listen. That you did 'treatment.' I wouldn't send my dogs to you, sir.""

When revealing Nassar's sentence, the judge is quoted as saying, ""I just signed your death warrant.""

""It is my honor and privilege to sentence you. You do not deserve to walk outside a prison ever again,"" she said. ""You have done nothing to control those urges, and anywhere you walk, destruction will occur to those most vulnerable.""

The proceedings took place one week after Biles opened up about the sexual abuse that she overcame at the hands of Nassar.

""I've felt a bit broken and the more I try to shut off the voice in my head the louder it screams. I am not afraid to tell my story anymore,"" she tweeted. ""I too am one of the many survivors that was sexually abused by Larry Nassar. Please believe me when I say it was a lot harder to first speak those words out loud than it is now to put them on paper.""

The gymnast went on to add, ""There are so many reasons that I have been reluctant to share my story, but I know now it is not my fault.""

Aside from his sentencing on Wednesday, Nassar received a 60-year federal prison sentence in December on child pornography charges. On Jan. 31, he will be sentenced for three criminal sexual conduct charges in Eaton County, Michigan, which he has also pled guilty to.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/simone-biles-reacts-to-larry-nassar-sentencing-monster-no-longer-has-power-to-steal-our-joy-215060/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
2630,3003,"100 Largest US Megachurches Do Not Affirm LGBT Causes, Mostly Led by White Pastors: Report","(Photo: Elevation Church) Elevation Church in Charlotte, N.C., is one of the largest and fastest-growing churches in the country.

An LGBT advocacy group released a report, showing that megachurches hold to traditional biblical teachings, with all 100 of the largest churches in the United States not affirming same-sex unions. The report also found that 93 percent of the megachurches are being led by a white pastor and only one has a female pastor.

Church Clarity, an LGBT-affirming group that reports on and categorizes churches based on their stated policies regarding LGBT issues, released the findings last week. The report is spurring a debate about the theological stances on sexuality as well as the racial and gender diversity among pastoral leadership and congregational membership in the 100 largest churches in America, as ranked by Outreach Magazine's popular annual list. All told, these congregations represent approximately 1.1 million Christians in America.

Founded last year, Church Clarity states that its mission is to ""promote clarity"" on church policies, specifically LGBTQ policies — which it considers ""critical information."" According to the CC report, 35 percent of the megachurches clearly state their LGBT positions on their websites. For 54 percent of the megachurches, their position is ""unclear"" — meaning they're not easily found on the website and may be ""buried"" in peripheral sections such as sermons, blogposts, or media. And 11 percent have ""undisclosed"" (cannot be found on website) LGBT policies.

Church Clarity's decision to report on racial and gender issues in addition to the degree of LGBT affirmation within congregations is reportedly part of the organization's ""expanding"" mission.

Writing at Religion News Service, Jonathan Merritt called the CC report ""explosive,"" noting that the ""staggering"" data that shows none of the megachurches have policies affirming same-sex people and relationships ""will doubtlessly provide firepower to conservative Christians who claim that LGBTQ+ affirmation is a slippery slope to liberalism and a congregation killer.""

Others maintain that this is but another round of trashing megachurches that are stereotypically known for glitzy flashiness and other factors some find unappealing, but are churches that usually proclaim traditional teaching, including on issues of sexuality and sexual ethics.

Mark Tooley, president of the Washington-based Institute on Religion & Democracy, observed on his organization's blog Tuesday that despite CC's intention to shame these large congregations for their traditional teaching on sexuality, they are the ones that are actually growing while liberal churches that have LGBT-affirming policies aren't.

""There are thousands of churches in America with liberal clergy. They could become megachurches if their messages and appeals were compelling to more people. But they aren't,"" Tooley wrote, adding that liberal iterations of most faiths exist mainly ""in the minds of some Western theologians and sociologists.""

""More permissive and theologically lax religion may sound appealing but it rarely attracts a sustained crowd, anywhere.""

Large crowds do not mean theological truth is being taught, but congregations that continue to die hardly indicate spiritual health, he said.

And while Church Clarity is also calling out megachurches for their lack of diversity in leadership, liberal mainline Protestant churches are even less racially diverse, Tooley argued.

Church Clarity lists as problematic in its report that only 7 percent of megachurches are led by people of color when racial minorities comprise nearly 40 percent of the general population. Similarly, the group laments that only one of the 100 megachurches listed has a female pastor, who co-pastors with her husband, when 8 percent of Fortune 100 CEOs are women.

""In a country/world where roughly 50% of the population is female, let's not get too excited about Fortune's 8% stat,"" CC notes. ""The point is to compare for-profit corporations vs churches.""

Yet Tooley pointed out that while megachurches originated in mostly white exurbs and suburbs and are often founded by entrepreneurial pastors, ""their congregations are more diverse than commonly imagined.""

A study from the Leadership Network and Hartford Institute in 2015 revealed that 10 percent of megachurches reported no racial majority, and 37 percent of megachurches have between 20 and 49 percent racial minorities attending congregations that are majority white.

The IRD president also posited that even though the average megachurch does not affirm LGBT causes, ""still by virtue of its size and variety of programs has more LGBTQ people than the average mostly empty liberal church proudly waving rainbow flags to little effect.""

Such is also the case regarding racial diversity among the supposedly inclusive theologically liberal churches. With the exception of the least liberal American Baptist denomination, Tooley said, the memberships of liberal mainline Protestant congregations range from 88 percent to 96 percent white.

""Their memberships are also much older,"" he continued. ""One survey says only 12 percent of Episcopal Church members are millennials. Likely far fewer are active worshipers. One survey says the average age of a megachurch worshiper is 40. For Mainline Protestants it's close to 60.""

He further pointed out that as for female clergy, some denominations like his own United Methodist Church have ordained women for many decades, even though the vast majority of Christians worldwide do not.

""Although I'm happy in my tradition, I'm loathe to condemn as intrinsically bigoted the vast majority with different teachings. If megachurches are chauvinistic and bigoted why do they more successfully attract women and non-whites than the ostensibly more enlightened liberal churches?"" he asked.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/100-largest-us-megachurches-do-not-affirm-lgbt-causes-mostly-led-by-white-pastors-report-212431/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
2631,3004,Kari Jobe Reveals How Motherhood Has Impacted Her Career,"(Photo: Christian Post/Scott Liu) Kari Jobe speaks with The Christian Post about her third album ""Majestic"" in New York on March 25, 2014.

Kari Jobe gave birth to her first child with fellow singer Cody Carnes almost two years ago, and now the worship leader is opening up about how motherhood has impacted her career.

Jobe, 36, spoke to The Morning Call about her son, Canyon, and how it can be challenging to tour with a toddler.

""Yeah. It just makes things a little trickier, you know? Going out on the road with unknown elements — like it's snowing now, so we can't get off the bus and go outside,"" she said. ""I think that's just the tricky part — just, like, it would be easier if he were just home.""

Cody was born in February 2016 and has been touring since he was a newborn baby.

""... We love doing this, and he's done it since he was a newborn baby, so he doesn't know anything different,"" she said. ""So I think he enjoys it and we just make the most of it.""

On her personal website, Jobe shared the inspiration behind naming her son Canyon.

""God gave us his name even before this whole thing took place,"" she revealed. ""Canyon means a deep ravine for water to flow through. Canyons are formed through storms, so the fact that God gave me his name was so peaceful to me ... I was thankful He gave me his name for that season.""

In a previous interview with CBN, Jobe spoke about how being a mother has influenced her approach to creating worship music.

""I love being a mommy. I love spending time with my son,"" she said. ""And even though he can only smile and throw food on me for now, I love to just be with Him. I think it has helped me slow down more while I lead and just wait in God's presence and just enjoy the environment of His spirit.""

Jobe likened her relationship as a parent to God's relationship with His children.

""I know God is the same way. He loves to just spend time with us,"" she said. ""So I've started cultivating more time for just 'being' ... as I worship alone by myself and in the corporate setting.""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/kari-jobe-reveals-how-motherhood-has-impacted-her-career-214725/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

Jennifer Hudson is revealing why she has taken the concept of collection plates outside of the church on to the set of ""The Voice UK.""

Hudson, the 36-year-old singer and actress who serves as a judge on ""The Voice UK"" and happens to be vocal about her Christian faith, brought a collection plate to the show. In a conversation with TV Life last week, the entertainer revealed why.

""A fan gave it to me in America. She said every time I sing I take everyone to church — and gave me a collection plate,"" Hudson revealed, according to the Daily Star. ""I said I would take it with me to The Voice UK. In church, we take up a collection after the choir sings.""

While Hudson spoke about bringing out the collection plate if singers in the competition perform well, she insisted that the money collected will be used for a good cause.

""So if the acts have sung exceptionally well, I feel the need to get up and take a collection from the audience,"" she said. ""Of course any money collected will go to charity.""

When speaking about the show to The Guardian last month, Hudson revealed more about her church roots. The entertainer was asked about a book that impacted her, which she revealed as the Bible.

""Which book changed your life?"" The Guardian asked Hudson in a Q&A style interview to which the entertainer responded, ""The Bible. I've been reading it since I was little and it hasn't failed me yet.""

In another interview with The Guardian four years ago, Hudson revealed that her Christian faith helped her deal with the 2008 homicide of her mother, older brother and 7-year-old nephew.

""It (faith) was the ultimate help to me. We always said: 'If He brings you to it, He will bring you through it,'"" Hudson previously said. ""There would be no point in faith if it wasn't tested. My mother always told me no matter how negative your life seems to be, you must always look for a positive.

2633,3006,"ACLU Using Undocumented Minors as 'Political Pawns' in Abortion Debate, Pro-Lifers Warn","(Photo: REUTERS/John Gastaldo) Alliance San Diego and other Pro-DACA supporters hold a protest rally, following U.S. President Donald Trump's DACA announcement, in front of San Diego County Administration Center in San Diego, California, U.S., September 5, 2017.

The American Civil Liberties Union is being accused by pro-life groups of using undocumented immigrant minors as ""political pawns"" to force the Trump administration to fund abortions.

Over the past few months, the ACLU has leveled multiple lawsuits against the federal government to reverse an administration policy banning elective abortions for illegal immigrant minors.

Chuck Donovan, president of the pro-life research group the Charlotte Lozier Institute, told The Christian Post in an interview that he believed the ACLU ""is using these girls as political pawns to push a larger agenda of making the United States a sanctuary nation for abortion.""

""Their claims are radical and extremely dubious. There is no consensus that there is a so-called 'constitutional right' to abortion, even for American citizens, let alone pregnant teens who come into this country illegally,"" said Donovan.

""As controversial as Roe v. Wade has been, it has never been interpreted this way. We believe HHS has a strong case that will likely go all the way to the Supreme Court.""

Donovan expressed concern over the potential opening of ""abortion tourism"" in which ""vulnerable young girls – who may have been abused or trafficked"" will ""travel to the United States to get abortions.""

A Change in Policy

Last October, the Trump administration reversed President Barack Obama's policy of allowing for pregnant illegal immigrant minors to obtain abortions.

The Administration for Children and Families, which oversees the Office of Refugee Resettlement, explained that there was ""no constitutional right for a pregnant minor to illegally cross the U.S. border and get an elective abortion while in federal custody.""

""Federal law is very clear on giving the director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement the legal responsibility to decide what is in the best interests of a minor in the unaccompanied alien children program and, in this case, her unborn baby,"" stated the ACF, as quoted by Politico.

""The Office of Refugee Resettlement is providing excellent care to this young woman and her unborn child and fulfilling our duty to the American people ... We cannot cede our responsibility to care for minors and their babies by releasing them to ideological advocacy groups.""

ACLU Litigation

In response to the policy change, the ACLU filed complaints on behalf of four undocumented pregnant teenagers, known in court documents as ""Jane Doe,"" ""Jane Roe,"" ""Jane Poe,"" and ""Jane Moe.""

A spokesperson for the ACLU directed CP to a Jan. 11 blog entry by Brigitte Amiri, senior staff attorney at the ACLU's Reproductive Freedom Project.

Expand | Collapse (Photo: REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein) Pro-life and pro-choice activists gather at the Supreme Court for the National March for Life rally in Washington January 27, 2017.

Amiri explained that the ACLU is pursuing a lawsuit, known as Garza v. Hargan, in district court to overturn the administration's general ban on abortions for undocumented minors.

""Until the court makes that ruling, we find ourselves in the position of having to request temporary restraining orders against the government in each individual case we find out about,"" wrote Amiri.

""As we made clear in our court papers ... the Trump administration is blatantly ignoring the fact that the Supreme Court has held for the past 45 years that abortion is a fundamental constitutional right. And that right does not depend on immigration status.""

Thus far, the ACLU has been successful in getting abortions for undocumented minors. Doe was able to get her abortion in late October, both Roe and Poe got theirs in December, and Moe was released earlier this month to do the same.

In its efforts to get abortions for the undocumented minors, the ACLU has been accused by the Justice Department of misleading the government on certain details.

For example, Justice Department filed a petition to the Supreme Court last November claiming that ACLU lawyers had agreed to keep it informed about the procedure, and that they purposefully moved the abortion of one of the minors from Oct. 26 to Oct. 25, before the administration could appeal to the high court.

""In light of that, the Justice Department believes the judgment under review should be vacated and discipline may be warranted against Jane Doe's attorneys,"" stated the Department.

Donovan of the Lozier Institute explained that these releases did not reflect a change in policy, but rather that the minors had found sponsors and were thus no longer in ORR custody.

""'Jane Moe' found a sponsor, usually an adult family member in the U.S., and is no longer in federal custody. Placing unaccompanied minors with a sponsor is always a priority for HHS, and once the child leaves their direct custody, medical decisions are handled by the sponsor,"" noted Donovan.

""The Trump administration still strongly opposes facilitating abortions for young girls in their care, out of compassion for both them and their unborn children. America is a pro-life nation and we ought to respond with love to both young mother and child.""

Taxpayer Expenses

Steven Aden, chief legal officer for Americans United for Life, told CP that the debate over the Trump administration's policy involves taxpayers funding of abortion.

Although the ACLU has noted in the past that private funds are used for the abortion procedure, Aden countered that other aspects connected to the abortion required federal expenditures.

Expand | Collapse (Courtesy, The Heritage Foundation) Internal Revenue Service

""Legally, they have jurisdiction and responsibility for her, they have to assign staff to be with her, there are other resources that are utilized to follow up on her as well as medical resources that are utilized to follow-up on her condition after the abortion to make sure that it went well,"" said Aden.

""So all these things are paid for by taxpayer dollars, so it is a subsidization of elective abortion on the part of the minor by U.S. taxpayer dollars.""

Aden felt that the administration's position ""faithfully reflects existing federal law,"" noting that the Hyde Amendment prohibits the federal funding of abortion in most circumstances.

""That is why the ACLU and its allies are pushing on this issue right now because they see a vulnerable point. Everyone is talking about immigration right now, their argument is that the administration should allow minor immigrants to obtain elective abortions,"" continued Aden.

""But the point is that they're in the country illegally and to allow them to obtain elective abortions would require the use of federal taxpayer dollars to monitor, follow up, to provide treatment and that's just contrary to what the law has always said at least since the Hyde Amendment came into effect in the late '70s.""

Aden believed that this was the ACLU's best route, for ""they can't make much headway obviously in the state legislatures and Congress, [since] the Republicans control both houses.""

""So they've chosen to push on this point, the point they see as a point of vulnerability which is immigration, but the principle remains that our tax dollars are not to be used to promote, to subsidize, to facilitate elective abortion,"" he noted.

""It goes contrary to the conscience of the taxpayer.""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/aclu-undocumented-minors-political-pawns-abortion-debate-pro-life-214683/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
2634,3007,"Tony Perkins: Evangelicals Gave Trump a Do-Over on Porn Star Sexcapade, Moral Failings","(Photo: REUTERS/Mike Segar) Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council leads the U.S. Pledge of Allegiance at start of the final day of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio, U.S. July 21, 2016.

Conservative evangelicals gave President Donald Trump a do-over when it came to his morally questionable behavior from years ago, said Family Research Council President Tony Perkins.

Recently, President Trump has been accused of having had an extramarital affair with a porn star back in 2006, mere months after his wife Melania gave birth to his son Barron.

In an interview with Politico's Off Message podcast posted Tuesday, Perkins explained that when it came to Trump's past behavior, such as the failed marriages and alleged affairs, evangelicals have been willing to give him grace.

""Among evangelicals, there is an understanding that we are all fallen and the idea of forgiveness is very prominent,"" said Perkins, adding that ""I think the evangelical community gives him grace for the mistakes that he's made.""

""We kind of gave him, 'alright you get a mulligan. You get a do-over' ... This is what he is committed to and as long as he commits to that and continues on that, he will have the support of evangelicals.""

Despite noting that evangelicals strongly support Trump for his policy efforts as president, Perkins warned that ""evangelical support is not unconditional.""

""If the president were to all of a sudden revert back to some of that behavior as president, the evangelical support will not be there for him,"" continued Perkins.

""It's not unconditional. This president keeps his commitment and his promise to the evangelicals that supported him, and he continues to walk the straight and narrow if you will, then the support will be there.""

Perkins' comments come not long after excerpts from a 2011 interview a porn star, who goes by the name Stormy Daniels, made claiming that she and Trump had an affair in 2006 after meeting at a golf event.

Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported that a lawyer for Donald Trump had paid $130,000 in hush money to Stormy Daniels to keep quiet the alleged affair during the election season.

Daniels, whose given name is Stephanie Clifford, has claimed to multiple publications that she had sex with Trump around the time that his wife Melania had given birth to their son Barron.

According to the story, Daniels and Trump began their affair in July 2006 at American Century celebrity golf tournament in which Trump invited the porn star into his room and they had what she later described as ""textbook generic"" sex.

Ben Shapiro, a conservative author and head of The Daily Caller, penned a column last week arguing that ultimately ""nobody will care"" about the Daniels affair because for most Americans these and other things have ""already been baked into the cake.""

""Now, that doesn't mean that Trump's stock price is high enough to win him re-election, or drive serious support for Republicans in 2018. It isn't. But simply throwing gossipy headlines at him does nothing to him, because we knew who he was when we elected him,"" wrote Shapiro.

""Perhaps that says something about many religious Americans: in their view, they've despaired of the culture anyway, so they may as well support the guy who will enact their priorities. Perhaps it says something about American society more broadly: the worst seem to get ahead, while the most virtuous seem to get left behind.""

Others have been more critical of Perkins' approach.

Conservative columnist Michael Gerson wrote for The Washington Post that Trump-supporting evangelicals ""have lost their gag reflex.""

""Some Christian leaders are surrendering the idea that character matters in public life in direct exchange for political benefits to Christians themselves. It is a political maneuver indistinguishable from those performed by business or union lobbyists every day. Only seedier. You scratch my back, I'll wink at dehumanization and Stormy Daniels. The gag reflex is entirely gone,"" stated Gerson.

In response to Perkins' Politico interview, Gerson tweeted, ""If you are looking for evidence relating to my column today, look at this.""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/tony-perkins-evangelicals-trump-do-over-mulligan-porn-star-sexcapade-moral-failings-214843/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
2637,3010,"Alabama Bill Eliminates Need for Marriage License, Wedding Ceremony to Comply With Same-Sex Marriage Ruling","(Photo: Reuters/Joshua Roberts) Supporters of traditional marriage between a man and a woman rally in front of the Supreme Court in Washington, June 26, 2015. The Supreme Court ruled on Friday that the U.S. Constitution provides same-sex couples the right to marry in a historic triumph for the American gay rights movement.

A bill that would eliminate the need for a marriage license and wedding ceremony to be legally married in Alabama could soon become law in a move local legislators argue would bring the state in line with the 2015 Supreme Court ruling on Obergefell v. Hodges which legalized same-sex marriage nationwide.

The bill, which has already passed the Alabama Senate, according to AL.com, would create a new process that would allow couples to submit affidavits to probate judges which would then be used as an official record of their marriage.

These affidavits would only be required to state that the spouses are at least 18, or at least 16 with parental consent, are not currently married and are not related by blood or adoption the report said. All other aspects of marriage such as divorce, child custody and child support are expected to remain the same in the state. The cost of this new process will be the same as the current cost of a marriage license, which is about $70.

Republican sponsor of the bill Sen. Greg Albritton who has sponsored similar bills since Obergefell v. Hodges, said the Supreme Court decision made his bill necessary.

""We have to bring a bill because of the decision,"" he said. ""I can't change the decision. That decision is the law of the land. The only thing I can do is try to make it easier and try to find some kind of middle ground that we in Alabama can live under that law.""

The new process would remove the state's role in any marriage ceremonies, properly separating church and state, he said.

Current state laws also do not require probate judges to issue marriage licenses, which protected the freedom of conscience for judges whose views didn't align with the Supreme Court ruling.

A number of judges, such as Washington County Probate Judge Nick Williams, stopped issuing marriage licenses after the Supreme Court ruling. Williams argued that the Supreme Court had no authority to ""redefine"" marriage because God created the institution.

The new bill will remove that discretion from probate judges and only require them to accept and record properly completed affidavits presented by couples.

Williams, who argues there is a difference between recording a document and adding his signature to it, says if this new bill becomes law he will abide by its requirements and record all marriages.

Democrat State Rep. Patricia Todd said she would vote for the new bill because she agrees that the state should not be in the position of deciding who can marry and should have changed the law years ago.

Current Alabama law states that a couple that has received a marriage license must ""solemnize"" the union in a ceremony. State law 30-1-7 says: ""Marriages may be solemnized by any licensed minister of the gospel in regular communion with the Christian church or society of which the minister is a member; by an active or retired judge of the Supreme Court, Court of Criminal Appeals, Court of Civil Appeals, any circuit court, or any district court within this state; by a judge of any federal court; or by an active or retired judge of probate.""

Albritton explained that the language on ""licensed minister"" is ambiguous and the requirement for a ceremony entangles the state unnecessarily in what should be a private affair, according to AL.com.

Alabama's House Judiciary Committee is expected to consider the bill on Wednesday, which could lead to a final vote in the House next week.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/alabama-bill-eliminates-marriage-license-wedding-ceremony-same-sex-gay-marriage-ruling-214979/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
2669,3045,Franklin Graham Argues With Don Lemon on Whether President Trump Has Christian Values,"(Screenshot: YouTube/Live Stream TV News) CNN anchor Don Lemon debates the Reverend Franklin Graham over the moral character of President Donald Trump.

Conservative evangelical leader the Reverend Franklin Graham recently debated CNN anchor Don Lemon over the character flaws of President Donald Trump.

In an interview on CNN that aired Tuesday evening, Lemon asked Graham, a staunch supporter of President Trump, why evangelicals seem hesitant to call out Trump's misbehavior but not President Bill Clinton when he was in office.

Graham responded that the difference between Clinton and Trump is that Clinton had his extramarital affairs while in office, whereas Trump's alleged affairs happened several years ago.

Expand | Collapse (Photo: Franklin Graham Facebook page) Franklin Graham (R) and Donald Trump in Alabama at a photo posted on December 18, 2016.

""These alleged affairs, that are alleged with Trump, didn't happen while he was in office. This happened 11, 12, 13, 14 years ago. And so, I think there's a big difference,"" responded Graham.

""Not that we give anybody a pass, but we have to look at the timeline and that was before he was in office and I think the president has changed quite a bit in the last 11 years, at least I have seen that.""

Lemon countered by noting that aside from the alleged extramarital affairs from several years ago, Trump has engaged in other morally questionable actions and statements.

""The payout to the porn star, that was in 2016, that wasn't 11 years ago, that's now; threatened nuclear war with North Korea, that's now; calls for a ban on religions entering the country, that's now,"" said Lemon.

""He has 15 accusers, some of them said it was shorter than a long time ago as you said. He started a fight with Gold Star families, started a fight with Gold Star widows, he fights with people on Twitter, he uses the word s-hole about certain countries. That's all in the current time.""

Lemon pressed Graham on whether the president should be a role model, paraphrasing a verse from the Gospel of Luke, ""out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.""

""I went to Catholic school, I went to Catechism, and then I went to Sunday School at my Baptist church,"" noted Lemon. ""And, the Bible and everyone always taught me to do unto others and to not attack others and that's all this president does.""

Graham's debate with Lemon comes not long after another conservative evangelical leader, Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council, took to defending Trump.

In an interview with Politico's Off Message podcast posted online on Tuesday, Perkins explained that when it came to Trump's past behavior, such as the failed marriages and alleged affairs, evangelicals have been willing to give him grace.

""Among evangelicals, there is an understanding that we are all fallen and the idea of forgiveness is very prominent,"" said Perkins, adding that ""I think the evangelical community gives him grace for the mistakes that he's made.""

""We kind of gave him, 'alright you get a mulligan. You get a do-over' ... This is what he is committed to and as long as he commits to that and continues on that, he will have the support of evangelicals.""

Perkins did go on to explain to Politico that ""evangelical support is not unconditional"" and that Trump could lose that support.

""If the president were to all of a sudden revert back to some of that behavior as president, the evangelical support will not be there for him,"" continued Perkins.

""It's not unconditional. This president keeps his commitment and his promise to the evangelicals that supported him, and he continues to walk the straight and narrow if you will, then the support will be there.""

2670,3046,Sam Brownback Confirmed as New International Religious Freedom Ambassador,"(Photo: Reuters/Mark Kauzlarich) Republican Kansas Governor Sam Brownback speaks to supporters after winning re-election in the U.S. midterm elections in Topeka, Kansas, on November 4, 2014.

Kansas Governor and former U.S. Senator Sam Brownback has been confirmed as the new Ambassador at large for International Religious Freedom.

In a party-line vote in which Vice President Mike Pence had to serve as tie-breaker, Gov. Brownback was confirmed Wednesday evening 50-49.

""Thank you to @POTUS, @VP, and all the Senators who supported my nomination. I'm looking forward to starting my new position as Ambassador and working hard for the American people and religious freedom around the world,"" stated Brownback on Twitter.

Last July, President Donald Trump announced that he was appointing Brownback to the position of International Religious Freedom Ambassador.

While in the U.S. Senate, Brownback was a key sponsor of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 — legislation that created the Office of International Religious Freedom, the ambassador position and the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom.

David Saperstein, who held the ambassador position during the Obama Administration, told World Magazine last year that he approved of the Brownback choice.

""This is a very strong appointment, and I look forward to working with him in furthering the cause of religious freedom around the globe,"" said Saperstein.

Brownback faced resistance from Democratic members of the Senate, who took issue with the socially conservative politician's views on LGBT issues.

""I just think that it's really important if you're going to be the ambassador trying to promote tolerance that you show that kind of attitude,"" stated Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri.

""And his difficulty with the question about using religion as an excuse to persecute or prosecute people who are gay, that was a disqualifier.""

For his part, Brownback garnered much opposition in Kansas for his pushing through of tax cuts that led to severe budget deficits for the Midwest state, according to The Hill.

""The legislature, controlled by Republicans, voted to reinstate many of those taxes Brownback cut [in 2017], overriding the governor's veto,"" reported The Hill.

Many organizations that focus on religious freedom issues expressed approval of the Brownback confirmation, with The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom Chairman Daniel Mark stating Wednesday that it ""could not have come soon enough.""

""We are witnessing immense challenges to religious freedom around the globe. We need to utilize every resource available to confront these challenges,"" stated Mark.

""USCIRF looks forward to working with Ambassador Brownback in advancing the U.S. government's promotion of international religious freedom.""

The Religious Freedom Institute praised the Brownback confirmation, with RFI President Thomas Farr saying in a statement released Thursday morning that Brownback ""will make U.S. religious freedom policy an integral part of America's national security strategy.""

""Ambassador Brownback's deep experience, and his commitment to religious freedom for all people, will help ensure American leadership in the vital work of reducing global religious persecution,"" stated Farr.

Family Research Council President Tony Perkins stated Wednesday that Brownback ""will significantly boost our nation's efforts to help those around the globe who are persecuted and targeted for genocide because of their religious faith.""

""As ambassador, he will have more authority and resources to prioritize religious freedom programs, and elevate the issue in our foreign policy,"" said Perkins.

""We applaud President Trump's nomination and the Senate's confirmation of Sam Brownback to promote religious freedom around the world, a significant accomplishment which helps fulfill the president's promise to address this issue.""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/sam-brownback-confirmed-new-international-religious-freedom-ambassador-215117/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
2671,3047,"Scholars Decipher One of Last Remaining Mysterious Parts of the Dead Sea Scrolls, Oldest Bible Texts","(Photo: Reuters/Baz Ratner) A preservationist works on a fragment of the Dead Sea Scrolls in a laboratory in the Israel Museum in Jerusalem October 18, 2010.

Israeli researchers have reportedly deciphered one of the last remaining unread parts of the Dead Sea Scrolls, more than half a century after their initial discovery.

A Haifa University spokesman told AFP on Sunday that scholars pieced together more than 60 tiny fragments of parchment, finding that the encrypted Hebrew writing makes up one scroll.

According to BBC News, the text describes ancient Jewish festivals that are no longer observed, called New Wheat, New Wine and and New Oil, part of a unique 364-day calendar.

Dr. Eshbal Ratson and Professor Jonathan Ben-Dov of Haifa University said that they also found that the ancient Jewish sect used the word ""Tekufah"" to describe the transition between the seasons.

Annotations left by a scribe correcting mistakes made by the original author helped shed light on the content.

""What's nice is that these comments were hints that helped me figure out the puzzle — they showed me how to assemble the scroll,"" Ratson told Haaretz.

The Dead Sea Scrolls, which date back from the third century BC to the first century AD, are some of the oldest known manuscripts of the Hebrew Bible.

Close to 900 of the scrolls were found in caves above the Dead Sea in a period between 1947 and 1956, containing Hebrew, Greek and Aramaic writing.

Some of the fragments, including a collection revealed in October 2016, contain information about God's promises of rewards for those who obey the 10 Commandments.

""If you walk according to my laws, and keep my commandments and implement them, then I will grant your rains in their season, so that the Earth shall yield its produce and the trees of the field their fruit,"" reads a translation of part of one fragment.

""I will grant peace in the land, and you shall lie down untroubled by anyone; and I will exterminate vicious beasts from the land, and no sword shall cross your land,"" the fragment continues. ""I will look with favor upon you, and make you fertile and multiply you.""

The authors of the scrolls remain a mystery, though some experts credit them to an ascetic desert sect called the Essenes.

Hebrew University announced another major find in February 2017 with the discovery of a 12th cave in the Judean desert that once contained Dead Sea Scrolls, though the ancient parchments themselves were missing.

Researchers said that the scrolls were likely stolen by Bedouin people in the 1950s.

""Until now, it was accepted that Dead Sea Scrolls were found only in 11 caves at Qumran, but now there is no doubt that this is the 12th cave,"" said Oren Gutfeld, one of the leaders of the excavating team.

""Although at the end of the day no scroll was found, and instead we 'only' found a piece of parchment rolled up in a jug that was being processed for writing, the findings indicate beyond any doubt that the cave contained scrolls that were stolen.""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/scholars-decipher-one-of-last-remaining-mysterious-parts-of-the-dead-sea-scrolls-oldest-bible-texts-214679/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
2672,3048,"'Prayer Warrior' Pastor Tortured, Then Hung to Death in Church; Congregation Terrified","(Photo: REUTERS/Ajay Verma) People pray at a church during Christmas celebrations in Chandigarh, India, December 25, 2015.

A pastor in India who was known for long five- to six-hour prayer sessions was found beaten, tortured and hung to death from the rafters of his church, parishioners said. The murder has deeply shocked the congregation.

Morning Star News reported on Sunday that the body of pastor Gideon Periyaswamy of Maknayeem Church in southern India was found early Saturday morning. His death comes after he had complained about Hindu extremists.

Pastor Azariah Reuben, a close friend of the 43-year-old victim, said that Periyaswamy converted from Hinduism 25 years ago, and has served as pastor in Adayachery for more than 12 years, becoming known as a ""prayer warrior.""

""The local Hindus were not happy with growing Christianity,"" Reuben said. ""They had several times tried to stop the ministry.""

A week before he was killed, the pastor had filed a complaint with local police ""on some village people troubling him."" Officials were reportedly investigating the incident before the pastor was found dead.

Periyaswamy's body displayed signs of being beaten and tortured, according to some members of his 70-strong congregation.

The British Asian Christian Association said that the parishioners who found the pastor removed the thin rope around his neck.

""On removing the rope the frightened parishioners found a blood clot around the throat and neck area of Pastor Gideon where the main pressure from the rope had choked the pastor, there were bruises and welts but no other traces of blood on his body,"" BACA described.

""Parishioners noticed that a gold ring was missing from the hand of Pastor Gideon but do not believe the crime was a burglary as nothing else was touched in the whole building.""

Reuben explained that at first, police had refused to file a complaint over the murder, and initially even wanted to rule it as a suicide; but church members and pastors from nearby villages came out to protest.

Some church members said that village elders could have been behind the killing.

""These people had cut the church's water supply by disconnecting the pipeline,"" said one member, who was not identified.

Nehemiah Christie, director of legislation and regulations for the Synod of Pentecostal Churches, said police must carry out a fair investigation.

""There is urgent need for an autopsy in the presence of a judicial magistrate,"" Christie told Morning Star News. ""Pastor Gideon Periyaswamy's death can't be ruled out as suicide.""

Periyaswamy's church had been targeted on a number of occasions in 2017, and had suffered vandalism, with local Hindu groups accusing the pastor of carrying out forced conversions.

""This attack has terrified our church parishioners to their core, the death is a brutal murder of a devout Christian pastor who was more vulnerable because he was alone and trusting of people. Pastor Gideon was well loved by all and we will all shed many tears for our lost brother,"" one parishioner, who wasn't named, told BACA.

""His murder has removed a dedicated, learned and very influential messenger for God from this earth, which is to the detriment of India as a nation,"" he added.

""We will continue to attend church and will provide full support to our future pastor, but the gap left by Pastor Gideon is a huge one to fill. His death only makes us all more committed to the church; the killers can't defeat God.""

Pastors who have converted to Christianity from Hinduism have faced severe attacks in India.

On Christmas Eve, one church leader was dragged on the streets, beaten, and threatened with death unless he renounced Jesus for the Hindu monkey god Hanuman, which he refused to do.

""In those moments when they were kicking and beating me, I felt that even if I die now, the Lord will make the ministry I leave behind fruitful,"" Pastor Karma Oraon of Harmu village of Ranchi District, Jharkhand state, said of the attack by 16 radicals.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/prayer-warrior-pastor-tortured-then-hung-to-death-in-church-congregation-terrified-214665/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
2673,3049,"UK Schools Acting Too Swiftly to Change Kids' Gender; 11-Y-O Girls on Puberty Blockers, Expert Warns","(Photo: Reuters) Lulu, a transgender girl, leans on a hammock at her home in Buenos Aires.

A psychologist at the only U.K. clinic for children seeking to change their gender has said that girls as young as 11 are being placed on puberty blockers and hormone treatment, and warned that schools act ""within minutes"" to register a child as the opposite sex.

Bernadette Wren, consultant clinical psychologist at the Gender Identity Development Service clinic in London, revealed in an interview with The Sunday Times that the youngest child receiving such treatment there is an 11-year-old girl who identifies as a boy.

Wren warned that schools in the U.K. are moving too fast in labeling a child as a member of the opposite sex.

""Schools might wait for the parents to approach them before changing things like names in the register, uniforms, pronouns, toilets, sports,"" she said.

""If a school just gets a whisper of a child who may be querying their gender and within minutes they are doing everything to make sure that child is regarded as a member of the opposite sex right from the word go — that may not be the best for that child,"" she added.

The psychologist revealed that about one in 10 of the children who are referred to the London clinic decide to opt out of the treatment.

GIDS says that GPs, schools, and support groups referred more than 2,000 children to its services in the space of nine months last year, which is a 20-fold increase from previous years when in 2009 there were only 97 referrals.

Wren warned that future generations may not think that the current way of handling the issue has been wise, noting that young people sometimes regret their decision to undergo gender change, which creates serious problems later on in life.

""Perhaps the choices they make when they are 16 look different when they are 30,"" she said.

""You can accept their feeling about gender difference but you do have to say alongside that — and without being transphobic — that there are really difficult treatment choices to be made.""

One of the main concerns she identified is infertility, with people who are born males losing their capacity to father children as a result of treatments.

Gender change issues concerning children have been highly controversial in the U.K. In December, shocked parents demanded that the National Health Service remove questions aimed at primary school children asking them if they ""feel different"" to the gender they were born with.

""At a time when children are growing up and having to deal with all sorts of challenges of the modern world, now they are being asked to confront their gender, which for many will be unsettling,"" Tim Loughton, a Conservative Party politician and former children's minister, said at the time.

""Clearly we need to be sensitive about the issue of gender and sexual orientation but forcing children to question whether they are the right gender so early on can be deeply destabilizing,"" he added.

The Lancashire Care NHS Foundation Trust said at the time in a response to the controversy that it will no longer be widely asking the question.

Debate also swirled around Girlguiding U.K., the country's leading organization for girls and young women, which in November announced that transgender members who are born male but identify as females will be allowed to use the same shower facilities as girls.

Feminist campaigner Julie Bindel said at the time: ""This is not a moral panic. The concern that I and many feminists have about boys invading bedrooms, tents and showers, is that disproportionately the victims of sexual violence are girls and women, and overwhelmingly, the perpetrators are boys and men.""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/uk-schools-acting-too-swiftly-change-kids-gender-11-year-old-girls-puberty-blockers-214825/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
2674,3050,80 Nigerian Christians Slaughtered in 'Inhuman' Violence; Victims Describe Being Hacked by Machetes,"(Photo: REUTERS/Afolabi Sotunde) People react as a truck carries the coffins of people killed by the Fulani herdsmen, in Makurdi, Nigeria January 11, 2018.

More than 80 Nigerian Christians have been slaughtered at the hands of radical Islamic herdsmen this month, with major Christian groups decrying the ""inhuman"" violence, as survivors describe what it felt like to be hacked by machetes.

Persecution watchdog group International Christian Concern said on Monday that more than 80 Christians have died in Benue State since Jan. 1, with 50 deaths in Logo and another 30 in Guma County.

The shooting and machete attacks have been carried out by Fulani herdsmen, nomadic Muslims who graze their cattle throughout the country, and for the past couple of years have been targeting Christian farmers who stand in their way.

Survivors described some of the attacks, with one man identified only as Vershima explaining how he and others had been ambushed on Jan. 3 by armed Fulani.

The herdsmen ""opened fire on us, killing three of the people I was conveying and injuring me,"" the man said, who was shot in the chest and left for dead.

Another survivor, named Peter, a local cattle guard, said the attackers who went after him ""were people I had interfaced with in that community.""

""I got up and called them by their names and tried to wrestle the machete they had out of their hands, but to no avail. I was overpowered and they began to cut me,"" said Peter, who is now in a hospital recovering from his wounds.

Officials in Benue passed an anti-open grazing bill last year which was seen as an attempt to put an end to the roaming and violence of the Fulani, but as ICC pointed out, the effort has ""failed thus far.""

The Rev. Musa Asake, the General Secretary of the Christian Association of Nigeria, came out with a major address last week, speaking on his ""grave concern"" for the continued attacks believers in the country are facing, both at the hands of the Fulani, and other terrorists, such as Boko Haram.

Asake said Benue, in particular, has seen ""horrendous and inhuman attacks"" going back to 2013, and accused government forces of not only not doing enough to protect citizens, but in some cases of collaborating with the herdsmen.

In detailing one attack on New Year's Day in Ilorin, the General Secretary said that security agents refused to intervene until three churches were burned.

""This pattern suggests collusion of the Security Units with the Islamist militia operating under such names as Fulani herdsmen, Boko Haram, 'unknown gunmen,' and 'group of vandals,'"" Asake asserted.

He also pointed to the Nigerian Air Force bombing a Christian IDP Camp in January 2017, leaving over 200 Christian refugees dead, which was presented to the nation as an accident.

""In December 2017, an Air Force spokesperson confirmed that the Nigerian Air Force sent an Alpha Jet and an EC 135 attack helicopter to fire 'warning' shots at Islamist militia attacking Christians in Numan, Adamawa state, but not to kill them,"" Asake continued.

""The villagers were later to report that the jet actually bombed the Christian villages resulting in the death of over 50 people, while the Nigerian Air Force said it merely fired warning shots at the Islamist militia attacking the villagers. This is jihad as we cannot understand fired warning shots in the narrative of this attack.""

CAN further accused President Muhammadu Buhari of failing to run Nigeria with Democratic values, and argued that he has ""no respect for human rights.""

""Under President Buhari, the murderous Fulani herdsmen enjoyed unprecedented protection and favoritism to the extent that the herdsmen treat Nigeria as a conquered territory,"" the statement read.

""Rather than arrest and prosecute the Fulani herdsmen, security forces usually manned by Muslims from the North offer them protection as they unleash terror with impunity on the Nigerian people.""

Buhari has insisted on a number of occasions that he is taking the Fulani attacks very seriously, and that his government is doing all it can to bring them under control.

""The president assured Nigerians that the rising attacks on communities by herdsmen will soon be brought under control by security forces deployed to the vulnerable areas across the country,"" noted a statement this week regarding a meeting between Buhari and the Board of Directors of the Nigerian Economic Summit Group in Abuja.

""He said the unfortunate incident of attacks, which had resulted in loss of lives and properties, had already brought sorrow and hardship on many Nigerians, with the government deeply affected,"" it added.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/80-nigerian-christians-slaughtered-inhuman-violence-victims-describe-being-hacked-by-machetes-214824/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

Close to 2,000 Christians in India came out to protest and block roads in Tamil Nadu state, demanding justice for a pastor who was beaten, tortured, and hanged following disputes with Hindu radicals. Police claim the pastor committed suicide.

UCANews reported that the Christians gathered for the protest on Monday, days after Pastor Gideon Periyaswamy was found hanging from a rope in a home close to his church.

Police inspector Amal Raj argued that ""prima facie it appears to be a case of suicide but we are looking at all possible angles.""

Members of Periyaswamy's congregation who found his body said that he displayed signs of being beaten and tortured, however, and was missing a gold ring from his finger.

The pastor had filed a complaint with police following trouble with Hindu hardliners, who did not want him preaching.

The 43-year-old unmarried pastor was known as a ""prayer warrior"" for his deep devotion and long five- to six-hour prayer sessions.

Pastor Azariah Reuben, a close friend of the victim, explained that local Hindus ""were not happy with growing Christianity.""

""They had several times tried to stop the ministry,"" Reuben said.

Pastor Immanuel Prabhakaran, who had also worked with Periyaswamy, said that local leaders also did not want him speaking about the Gospel with lower-caste people in the area.

""Not a single Sunday service in the past six months passed off peacefully without disturbance,"" Prabhakaran said.

Lawyer Gini Immanuel added that Periyaswamy, whom he helped file the complaints, had many issues with the hardliners.

""Once the church water supply was cut and the church's roof was demolished. I intervened in the matter and represented the issue to the district authorities,"" Immanuel revealed.

The Rev. Joel Sekar of the Synod of Pentecostal Churches said that believers will continue protesting on the streets until a fair post mortem is carried out and until the pastor receives justice.

Wilson Chowdhry, chairman of the British Asian Christian Association, pushed back against police claims that the pastor took his own life.

""The circumstances of his death especially the removal of his gold ring, the lack of a suicide note, the visible bruising and numerous threats and previous incidents, all point in the direction of foul play. Intolerant local police are shamefully choosing to ignore tangible evidence,"" Chowdhry argued.

""Exhibited police insouciance and apathy when investigating crimes against Christians serves to embolden radicals who gain a sense of impunity, for as long as this continues we can only expect more crimes of this nature in India,"" he added.

Chowdhry warned that India is slowly regressing toward the kind of ""anarchy"" that has consumed Pakistan, where Christian victims of religious-based violence often do not receive help or justice from local authorities.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/thousands-of-indian-christians-protest-after-police-claim-tortured-hanged-pastor-committed-suicide-214975/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
2698,3075,'Beyond Disgusting': Critics Slam Vatican's Push to Replace Chinese Bishops With Communist-Backed Ones,"(Photo: Reuters) Pope Francis looking out at people waving Chinese flags in this undated photo.

Critics are speaking out against the Vatican's ongoing efforts to force two Chinese bishops to retire so that they can be replaced by church leaders approved by the Communist government, which has been persecuting Christians across the country.

As AsiaNews reported on Monday, Bishop Peter Zhuang of Shantou and Bishop Jospeh Guo Xijin of Mindong have been asked to step aside so that the Communist-backed Bishop Huang Bingzhang can come into power.

Bingzhang was excommunicated by the Catholic Church in 2011 when he accepted illicit episcopal ordination without the pope's approval, and has been a long-time member of the National People's Congress, China's parliament.

Catholic News Agency points out that the Vatican has been attempting to re-establish relations with the Chinese government, which is leading it to side with clergy appointed by the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association. The association is backed by the government.

Underground Catholics, however, along with church pastors from other denominations, have for years faced a crackdown at the hands of Chinese authorities, with hundreds of worshipers and church leaders arrested.

Shantou, who is recognized by the Vatican, was asked to retire by the Holy See back in December, but has so far refused to do so.

A source told AsiaNews that the Vatican has been trying to offer a consolation by allowing Shantou to nominate three priests for Huang to choose a vicar general from.

""Bishop Zhuang could not help his tears on hearing the demand,"" the source explained, adding that ""it was meaningless to appoint a vicar general, who is still a priest that Bishop Huang could remove him anytime.""

Critics, such as Rod Dreher, editor of the American Conservative, who converted from Catholicism to Eastern Orthodoxy, called the situation ""beyond disgusting.""

""It is possible to hold on throughout the persecution. Perhaps the thinking in Rome is that it is better to guarantee the validity of the sacraments throughout the communist time, so that the Catholic Church will still validly be present when communism passes,"" he said.

Dreher pointed out that Catholic and Orthodox ecclesiology is different from Protestant ecclesiology, as sacraments are valid even if a priest is personally corrupt.

""But without valid sacraments — which require a validly ordained bishop, and a validly consecrated clergy — there is no church, only ecclesial communities,"" he added.

""Maybe what Rome is trying to do is to gamble to keep the Catholic Church alive through the dark communist night. That's the best spin I can put on it.""

Last year, it was reported that the Vatican and the Communist Party were working on a deal aimed at ordaining Chinese bishops, seeking to end ""decades of frosty ties.""

ChinaAid President Bob Fu told The Christian Post at the time, however, that Pope Francis needs to be aware that the Chinese government has not relented in its persecution of believers.

""A partnership between the Vatican and the Chinese government would worsen the lives of house church Christians. The Communist Party already targets clergy who are not ordained by the state as illegitimate, which leads to persecution, and having the Vatican's backing gives them a further excuse to do so,"" Fu told CP in March.

""They may also feel emboldened in their persecution of Christians who practice their faith outside of government churches, since such a union would be the Vatican's stamp of approval on the Party's approach to Christianity.""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/beyond-disgusting-critics-slam-vaticans-push-to-replace-chinese-bishops-with-communist-backed-ones-214976/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
2699,3076,Shocking Footage Captures Screaming Syrian Child Being Rescued; 50 Other Children Killed (VIDEO),"(Screenshot: BBC News) Video footage shows Syrian child being rescued from the rubble in Eastern Ghouta in January 2018.

Footage obtained from Eastern Ghouta in Syria has captured the dramatic rescue of a young child from underneath a large pile of rubble. But at least 50 other children are among the 200 people who have died in the area due to the bombings over the past couple of weeks.

A BBC News video, published Tuesday, showed people pulling out a 3-year-old boy named Mahmoud from the rubble of a building that was taken down in an air strike.

Although Mahmoud survived, his older brother was lost in the rubble, the report said.

The video showed another eight civilians being pulled out alive with the help of workers and locals.

Eastern Ghouta is one of the heavily besieged areas finding itself in the crossfire of Syria's civil war, with at least 200 people being killed due to air strikes, shelling, and bombardment between government forces and rebels who are trying to take down President Bashar Al Assad.

UNICEF, the U.N.'s agency for children, said last week that as many as 200,000 children have been trapped under siege since 2013, when the civil war intensified.

""It is shameful that nearly seven years into the conflict, a war on children continues while the world watches. Millions of children across Syria and in neighboring countries have suffered the devastating consequences of unabating levels of violence in several parts of the country,"" the organization said in a statement.

""UNICEF received information from inside east Ghouta that people are taking shelter underground in fear for their lives. One particular heavy attack on residential buildings was so strong it reportedly injured 80 civilians including children and women. Medical personnel struggled to pull survivors out of the rubble.""

The BBC video further shows how survivors of the attacks are struggling without shelter, food or jobs. There's no money to purchase firewood either as families suffer in winter cold temperatures.

And desperate families have risked their lives crossing snow-covered mountains in freezing temperatures to find safety in Lebanon. At least 12 Syrians, including two children, died last week during such treks, according to UNICEF.

""More children could be among the dead as residents in the area and the Lebanese authorities continue to look for people who are reportedly trapped in the mountainous in freezing temperatures and snow,"" said Geert Cappelaere, UNICEF regional director for the Middle East and North Africa, on Saturday.

Meanwhile, watchdog groups, such as the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, have said that chlorine gas has been used in the bombing of Syrian cities, though the government's army continues to deny that it has used any kind of chemical weapons against its own people.

The United States has continued to insist that Syria is not only using chemical weapons in its fight against rebels, which has contributed to the deaths of thousands of innocent civilians, but that Russia is complicit by continuing to stand by Assad.

""There is simply no denying that Russia, by shielding its Syrian ally, has breached its commitments to the United States as a framework guarantor and has betrayed the chemical weapons convention and the UN Security Resolution 2118,"" U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Tuesday, according to Fox News.

Tillerson was speaking about an agreement made in 2013 between Russia and the U.S. that would have secured the removal of chemical weapons from Syria.

""Russia's failure to resolve the chemical weapons issue in Syria calls into question its relevance to the resolution of the overall crisis,"" he added. ""At a very minimum, Russia must stop vetoing and at least abstain from future Security Council votes on this issue.""

Nikki Haley, U.S. ambassador to the U.N., also accused Russia of failing to live up to the agreements.

""If these reports are true, this attack in Syria should weigh heavily on their conscience. The United States will never stop fighting for the innocent Syrian children, women, and men who have become victims of their own government and those who continue to prop it up,"" she said, referring to suspected poisonous gas use in the Duoma district on Monday.

2700,3077,Pentecostal Mother Fighting for Brain-Damaged Baby's Life Says God Will Decide When He Dies,"(Photo: Reuters/Toby Melville) NHS in London, England.

A Pentecostal Christian mother is fighting for her 11-month-old baby to be allowed further intensive treatment, declaring that God should decide when he dies, not doctors who think he's too brain-damaged to recover.

""I am a Pentecostal Christian,"" Takesha Thomas said at a High Court trial, as reported by Premier on Wednesday. ""For me, I don't think it is right to say who should live or who should die.""

""If God wants to take the person, He will,"" she added.

The Guardian reports that physicians at King's College hospital in London say the baby, Isaiah Haastrup, is not only brain-damaged due to oxygen deprivation at birth, but also cannot move or breathe without assistance, and is showing no ""purposeful"" responses.

The doctors believe he should be taken off life support as there is no hope for any recovery, though Thomas insists that he does show limited reactions, such as slowly opening his eye when she reads to him or cuddles or bathes him.

""When I call his name, I say: 'Isaiah it's mummy,' he will also give me a response by opening his eyes,"" she said.

The parents, including father Lanre Haastrup, are asking to be allowed to bring Isaiah home, where he will need 24-hour intensive care.

Thomas has argued that despite what doctors are saying, with enough love and care, there is still hope for her child.

""I don't know how they come to that conclusion. I see a child that is injured. He needs love. He needs care, and I have it and can give it,"" the mother declared.

""For them [the doctors] to say it's so poor it's not worth living, that's not right. That's not their decision to make.""

She said that doctors have only assessed Isiah for short periods of time, but she sees first hand that he is not as unresponsive as they are claiming.

""The more I say to them that I have seen Isaiah open his eyes, they will dismiss it and say it's not. They are trying to say I'm not right,"" she continued.

Still, expert medical witnesses say that there is often ""a mismatch between what parents perceive and what carers perceive to be purposeful responses.""

They said that movements do not always mean a purposeful response, and in fact jaw-clenching and muscle-stiffening could be caused by severe dystonia.

Thomas' plight is similar to other high-profile cases of parents fighting for their child to be allowed to continue treatment, such as 11-month-old Charlie Gard last year.

The parents, Coonie Yates and Chris Gard, challenged Great Ormond Street Hospital in London's decision to stop treatment for Charlie, who had an extremely rare genetic condition that caused progressive brain damage and muscle weakness.

They petitioned to be allowed to take Charlie for experimental treatment in the United States, but were unsuccessful in their bid.

The case, which prompted many weeks of passionate debate, and drew comments from world leaders such as U.S. President Donald Trump and Vatican leader Pope Francis in support of the parents, ended late in July when Charlie died.

Thomas Evans and Kate James are two other British parents, this time fighting Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool, hoping that their 18-month-old boy, who is suffering from a mystery brain condition, is allowed continued treatment on life support.

The hospital has said that baby Alfie Evans is in a coma and suffers regular seizures and has no hope for recovery.

The parents insisted in December that their child has already defied expectations on a number of occasions when he had been given only hours to live, however, and continues fighting for his life.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/pentecostal-mother-fighting-brain-damaged-babys-life-god-decide-when-he-dies-215107/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
2701,3078,Christians in New Zealand Rally to Reinstate Jesus' Name in Parliament Prayer,"(Photo: REUTERS/Ana Nicolaci da Costa) A police car is seen in front of the parliament building in Wellington, New Zealand, September 21, 2017.

Christians in New Zealand are planning to hold a rally outside the country's Parliament building to urge the speaker of the House to reinstate the name of Jesus Christ in the Parliamentary prayer after it was removed last year.

""At the beginning of the new Parliament, on the first business day, it always begins with a prayer and the name of Jesus Christ was deleted from that prayer. Many of us have made submissions to Parliament to reinstate the prayer,"" Pastor Rasik Ranchord of Abundant Life Church said in a statement on Wednesday.

Christians have said they will gather on Jan. 30 in Wellington at the Parliament building, when the House sits for the first time in the year.

Jesus for New Zealand spokesperson Pastor Ross Smith of Celebration Church Wellington explained that the gathering is not a protest, but a movement aimed at bringing believers together.

""We feel that the Church does not have a voice in this change and we are here to change that,"" Smith said.

""Numbers speak to Parliament and this rally may be the only way to keep Jesus in the prayer, that is why we are calling for all Christians to be a part of this movement.""

The controversy stems from a decision announced in November, when Speaker of the House Trevor Mallard began using a new prayer at the start of every sessions that removed references to Jesus, and Queen Elizabeth.

While the original version of the prayer used the phrase ""Jesus Christ our Lord,"" and the new version still references ""Almighty God,"" Christ's name is missing from the latest text.

Christianity has been on a major decline in the country, with national census data from 2013 revealing that less than half, or 48.9 percent of the population, identify themselves as Christians.

The country's 37-year-old Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, is an agnostic, and was sworn in at a non-religious ceremony in October. She's also the youngest woman to lead the nation.

Ardern has said that she was raised as a Mormon, but left the LDS Church in her early 20s when she could not reconcile supporting her gay friends with the religion's conservative positions on marriage.

Mullard meanwhile told rally organizers that he would consider their request to bring back Jesus' name to the prayer over the holidays, but has not yet revealed his decision.

Pastor Merita Lau Young of Hosanna World Outreach Center said believers need to make it clear how important their faith is.

""We need to walk to the talk,"" Young said. ""Jesus is alive and well in our life and the community, Parliament and our nation Aotearoa need to know that.""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/christians-new-zealand-rally-reinstate-jesus-name-parliament-prayer-215113/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
2702,3079,Bolivian President Revokes Anti-Evangelism Law; Major Victory for Evangelicals After Days of Protests,"(Photo: REUTERS/ABI/Bolivian Presidency/Handout via Reuters) Bolivia's President Evo Morales reads an official statement during a news conference in Sucre in this July 8, 2014 handout picture.

Bolivian President Evo Morales has said he will revoke a new penal code that would have criminalized evangelism, explaining that he wants to ""avoid confusion"" following protests, prayer and fasting by evangelicals.

Evangelical Focus translated a tweet by Morales on Sunday, which included the announcement of the repeal of the penal code that had previously been approved on Dec. 15.

""The national government will never approve laws against the Bolivian people,"" the president insisted, but at the same time accused opposition forces of ""conspiring"" and ""destabilizing the country with misinformation and lies.""

Morales said the government will now listen to proposals ""of all sectors of the country"" for a new penal code.

Article 88.1 of December's penal code had threatened anyone who ""recruits, transports, deprives of freedom or hosts people with the aim of recruiting them to take part in armed conflicts or religious or worship organizations"" with between five to 12 years in prison, which caused great concern for the minority evangelicals.

""We express our most resolute rejection of the inclusion of our ministerial activities in the list of possible conducts that go against the law,"" the National Association of Evangelicals in Bolivia said in a statement back then.

""The legislator forgets that the evangelical Christian churches in Bolivia are religious organizations recognized by the Bolivian state, and, therefore, legal entities,"" it added.

Protests against the new law included recent marches in Cochabamba, while evangelical churches across the nation held days of prayer and fasting.

Major bodies, such as the World Evangelical Alliance, spoke out on the issue, and just a day before Morales' announcement sent out a prayer alert.

The WEA, which says it represents 600 million believers worldwide, called on prayers for the government to withdraw the new penal code provision.

""Pray that the authorities would not restrict, but protect and promote religious freedoms in Bolivia,"" it urged.

""Pray for God's guidance and favor upon Bolivian Christians who are protesting against the new law and advocating for greater religious freedoms in the country.""

The Adventist Review, which said that the Seventh-day Adventist Church has also warned against legislation that would endanger freedom of belief, assembly, and worship, pointed to local newspapers that have highlighted that the implications of the latest decision are still unclear.

""So far we hear only announcements,"" Cochabamba Civic Committee President Juan Flores told El Deber. ""Protests will continue until all our demands are met.""

The Seventh-day Adventist Church itself has called on its members to pray for civic authorities.

""Pray that God may grant His wisdom to authorities as they discuss this topic,"" the church has said.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/bolivian-president-revokes-anti-evangelism-law-victory-evangelicals-protests-214822/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555

Christian churches in Syria are crying out for help and assistance amid deadly attacks by Turkish forces on Kurdish areas of the civil war ravaged nation.

Churches in Afrin are calling on the international community not to ignore their plight as they face ""great danger from Turkey and its jihadist alliance,"" which began a military campaign in the Afrin region last week on grounds that Kurdish militias pose a ""security"" threat.

As clashes between Syrian Democratic Forces and Turkish-led forces that include allied militant factions have taken place throughout the region over the last several days, thousands of civilians have fled their homes and a number have been killed as a result of the conflict.

The violence is also impacting religious minorities in the region, such as Yazidis and Christians, who have experienced a level of religious freedom under the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria that advocates say is not enjoyed by religious minorities living in other parts of the Middle East.

""As the leaders of the Christian churches in North Syria, in the town of Afrin we hereby confirm that we are under attack by Turkey,"" an open letter from Pastor Hakim Ali Ismael, senior pastor of a network of churches in Afrin and Kobane, to international leaders reads. ""The lives of our women and children are in danger. The city of Afrin is being bombarded by Turkish airstrikes. We are asking for intervention, and protection against the violent attacks which are being levied against use at the moment.""

""Many lives are in mortal danger,"" the letter, which was shared with The Christian Post, reads. ""We are requesting aid and assistance. We are unable to protect ourselves or our families against these attacks, neither are we able to offer assistance or shelter the innocents.""

According to the letter, there are more than 200 Christian families that live in the Afrin area.

Afrin is an isolated part of the Syrian federation that borders areas controlled by Islamist rebels and the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

In Afrin, evangelical Christianity had steadily grown over the past several years, according to Johannes de Jong, the director of the European Christian think tank Sallux who has worked with Syriac Christians since the rise of the Islamic State in 2014.

""[I]t is only since the beginning of the civil war that these churches started to grow. This was also possible as the Federation of Northern Syria realized full freedom of religion which allowed the public establishment of churches and missionary work,"" de Jong told CP on Tuesday. ""[Ninety-five percent] of the believers have a Muslim background so almost all church members are converts to Christianity. There are at least three Christian congregations in the various parts of Afrin. The largest congregation consists of approximately 200 families.""

Turkey began its attack on the area last week on the grounds that the People's Protection Units, the Kurdish militia in Syria also known as YPG, is a terrorist group that threatens the NATO country's security.

De Jong, however, points out that YPG is part of the Syrian Democratic Forces that worked with the United States-led fight against the Islamic State.

""What we are hearing from these Kurdish churches in Afrin is that they have to sleep in basements out of fear of bombings,"" de Jong said. ""Some are hiding in the mountains. I am getting quite terrible pictures. It is clearly a threat to the freedom of these Christian communities. The existence of these Christian communities is really under threat. As Christians, they simply know what will be coming for them if these al Qaeda-type of militias take over the area.""

De Jong expressed concern that terrorist outfits such as the al Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front are involved in the Turkish attack on Afrin.

""The Turkish outlet 'Cumhuriyet Gazetesi' published these pictures of the Turkish allies in the Afrin operation. Thanks to that we now have evidence that al-Qaeda is part of the Turkish-backed militias that are part of the invasion in Afrin,"" de Jong explained in an email. ""The intention of these pictures is to show the Turkish allies. The man [in photo No. 21 on the website] wears a [bandana] of Al Nusra. [It is] undisputed is that al-Nusra is al-Qaeda in Syria. It is unbelievable that such a threat is supported by anyone at all.""

On Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis urged Turkey to use restraint in its operations in Syria.

""This could be exploited by ISIS and al-Qaeda, obviously, that we're not staying focused on them right now. And obviously it risks exacerbating the humanitarian crisis that most of Syria is going through,"" Mattis told reporters during his trip to Indonesia.

Mattis' comment comes after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Monday that ""We recognize and fully appreciate Turkey's legitimate right to protect its own citizens from terrorist elements.

De Jong criticized Tillerson's remark and called on American Christians to stand up and urge the U.S. government to take action to stop the Turkish operation in Afrin.

""We hear Rex Tillerson speaking about Kurdish concerns for their security. Turks are at the same moment using al-Qaeda militias to attack Afrin and these Kurdish Christians are literally crying out for help. What is this?"" de Jong asked. ""What needs to happen now is that U.S. Christians need to stand up and tell the Trump administration that this needs to stop immediately. There is no right to bomb a civilian population. There is no right in any NATO treaty or whatever to indiscriminately bomb civilians.""

""These guys have already said there is no place for Christians. These Kurdish Christians, you can see it in the statements that they make, they know that these jihadists are the real threat for them,"" de Jong continued. ""This is happening right now and the U.S. is allowing it to happen.""

De Jong asserted that if the U.S. wanted to, it could have a military presence in Afrin.

""There is no problem any more to go to Afrin. First of all, the Russians pulled back. That means that airspace is open. The second point is that U.S. forces have already been between the rest of the federation and Afrin. If they can be there once, they can be there again. Russia will not object. Turkey will not really be able to object because they can't directly attack the U.S. and the U.S. could say if they want that they are going after these al-Qaeda guys that are hiding in these areas. Obviously, they will be able to stop the attack in Afrin.""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/christian-churches-under-attack-amid-turkeys-bombardment-syrian-city-214838/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
2704,3081,Texas Judge Says God Told Him Suspected Sex Trafficker Was Not Guilty,"(Screenshots: YouTube) Comal County, Texas Judge Jack Robison (L) told jurors that God told him 32-year-old Gloria E. Romero-Perez (R) was not guilty of trafficking her teenage niece.

A judge in Comal County, Texas, could face disciplinary action after he was accused of trying to influence a trial by telling jurors that God told him a woman accused of trafficking her teenage niece was innocent.

""I apologize to you folks but when God tells me I gotta do something, I gotta do it,"" Judge Jack Robison reportedly told jurors about the case of 32-year-old Gloria E. Romero-Perez after trying to convince them that the Lord had vouched for her innocence, according to the Herald Zeitung.

Romero-Perez was accused in 2016 of selling her then 15-year-old niece to a man the teen met at a local church for $6,000. She allegedly paid for her niece to be smuggled into the U.S. from Honduras then sold her to Julio Amilcar Jimenez-Ramirez, 34, who was also arrested. Local police got involved with the case after Romero-Perez reported her niece had run away.

Police eventually located the teenager, who produced receipts to show payments toward her sale price.

Romero-Perez had entered into an informal agreement with Jimenez-Ramirez that he would pay the teen $600-$700 monthly. After the teen moved in with Jimenez-Ramirez, however, her aunt became impatient with the payments and threatened to call the police.

""[Jimenez-Ramirez said] the aunt was extorting the money from him and he was threatened that she would tell the police and call immigration on him,"" said Comal County Sheriff Office Detective Anthony Moreno.

Romero-Perez' niece became pregnant and gave birth as a result of her relationship with Jimenez-Ramirez and the child was placed in the care of Child Protective Services.

Shortly after Robison delivered his message from God to the jurors deliberating the case, he recused himself from the remainder of the proceedings.

Despite the divine word, the jury panel of seven men and five women found two hours later that there was enough to convict Romero-Perez on one count of continuous traffic of a person and was sentenced to 25 years in prison. She was acquitted on a second charge of sale or purchase of a child.

The State Commission on Judicial Conduct did not say whether Robison was being investigated but they said actions like that could lead to punishment, according to News 4 San Antonio.

Eric L. Vinson, executive director of the State Commission on Judicial Conduct, said: ""That's an issue that we would definitely investigate and present to the commission as potential misconduct. Legally, a judge is really not supposed to be weighing in on the facts of the case.""

The woman's attorney had asked for a mistrial but was denied. Robison is currently on leave but is expected to return to work on Jan. 31.",https://www.christianpost.com/news/texas-judge-says-god-told-him-suspected-sex-trafficker-was-not-guilty-214684/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
2707,3084,"Kentucky School Shooting: 15-Y-O Boy Kills 2 Students, Wounds 12","(Photo: Reuters) A school bus is shown in this file photo.

A 15-year-old boy opened fire with a handgun in his high school in western Kentucky on Tuesday, killing two fellow students and wounding a dozen other youths before being arrested, the state's governor and police said.

The shooting began shortly before 8 a.m. CST (1400 GMT) at Marshall County High School in Benton, a small town about 130 miles (210 km) northwest of Nashville, Tennessee, according to Kentucky State Police and Governor Matt Bevin.

Authorities offered no information on the motive behind the shooting. There was no immediate indication how well the youth, who officials said faces multiple charges of murder and attempted murder, knew the victims.

""There's no good answer for it,"" Bevin told reporters at an afternoon news conference. ""There's 1,000 hypotheses we're not going to go into.""

The bloodshed at the school, where nearly 1,150 students are enrolled, was the latest outbreak of gun violence that has become a regular occurrence at schools and college campuses across the United States over the past several years.

Tuesday's carnage occurred just 32 miles (52 km) from Heath High School in West Paducah, Kentucky, where in 1997 a 14-year-old boy opened fire on a group of students, killing three.

In Tuesday's shooting, 14 students were struck by gunfire, two of them fatally. One, a 15-year-old girl, died at the scene, and a 15-year-old boy was pronounced dead at a hospital trauma center, Bevin said.

Five of the 12 surviving wounded students were taken by helicopter to the Vanderbilt University Medical Center's trauma center in Nashville, a hospital spokeswoman said.

Another five students suffered non-gunshot injuries, Bevin said.

Kentucky State Police Commissioner Richard Sanders said the 15-year-old suspect walked into the school armed with a handgun and started shooting. The governor said the youth was apprehended at the scene ""in a nonviolent way,"" but Bevin did not elaborate.

No further details of the circumstances of the shooting were immediately divulged by authorities. None of the students involved were being publicly identified, Bevin said.

Agents from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation were taking part in the investigation, officials said at the news conference.

The school serves Marshall County, which has population of about 31,000.

During the news conference at the county Board of Education, Governor Bevin paused to collect himself as his voice choked with emotion, asking members of the news media to exercise restraint in dealing with the families of victims.

""I beg of you again - respect the fact that these children belong to this community and to specific families in this community. And this is a wound that is going take a long time to heal. And for some in this community it will never fully heal.""",https://www.christianpost.com/news/kentucky-school-shooting-15-y-o-boy-kills-2-students-wounds-12-214853/,2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555
3480,4001,The Church Should Lead in Giving Moral Examples and Here's Why,"[PHOTO:REUTERS]

Over the past several months our society has experienced a monumental shift in the treatment of women — particularly in regard to how they are treated by men in power.

Dozens of stories of men coercing women into sexual encounters by using their power over them have emerged. Prominent men in almost every industry have fallen from grace. Women have risen up to say ""no more.""

Recently, Hollywood made a bold statement as women and men paraded down the Golden Globes red carpet wearing black in solidarity with the #TimesUp and #MeToo movements. Though this display of support won't replace real action, it is a sign that Hollywood is saying mistreating and abusing women in any form will no longer be tolerated.

Contrast that with what is happening in the Christian Church.

On Jan. 7, prominent Memphis pastor Andy Savage admitted to a sexual encounter with a high school student 20 years ago, after the woman involved made her story public. He received a standing ovation from his congregation after asking for forgiveness.

What are we doing, Church?

The Church has operated under a cloud of shame and silence for decades. I experienced this firsthand when I came to my church for help as a victim of domestic violence. After years of enduring physical, mental, and emotional abuse, I filed for divorce and turned to my lifelong church for aid.

Instead of helping, my church instead called me before church discipline as punishment for divorce. My ex-husband received no condemnation.

During my years in women's ministry, I have seen my story repeated dozens of times. I've met women who weren't believed or who were returned to their abusers with the admonishment to ""submit."" We've seen similar stories play out in the news, but for every woman brave enough to bring her story to the press, there are likely hundreds more suffering in silence.

While secular society has recently rushed to correct its mistakes in silencing women, the Church seems to be doubling down. Instead of condemning the abuse of a high school student, a congregation supported its pastor without question. There was no talk of how a church should handle these incidents or the emotional consequences experienced by the woman involved. Instead, the congregation only discussed forgiveness for Andy Savage and remorse that his victim was not on the same ""road to healing.""

The Church should always set the moral example for the rest of the world, and on this issue we have failed. We've sat back and allowed Hollywood to take responsibility for advocating for women instead of rising up against the sin in our midst. While the Church should practice grace and forgiveness, there must be real, tangible consequences for sexual misconduct — especially when it involves a minister using his power to coerce women into sexual acts.

It's time for leaders to take women seriously. When a woman comes forward, whether she's sharing about domestic violence or sexual misconduct of a minister, there needs to be a swift response from church leadership. Her safety — both emotional and physical — must be of utmost importance. The leadership's first instinct should be her care, not determining ""whether she's telling the truth"" or ""whether she participated willingly.""

If pastors across the nation don't take immediate steps to advocate for the women in their congregations by speaking out against domestic violence and sexual misconduct, we are abdicating our role as the moral compass of our nation. We cannot expect America to look to us for guidance when we are disregarding the care of half the population. If we give up our responsibility on this issue, we give it up on every issue, from race relations to marriage.

If #TimesUp for Hollywood, it's way past due for the Church.

3481,4002,Living the True Meaning of Pro-Life,"[PHOTO:UNSPLASH/SUHYEONCHOI]

If being ""pro-life"" only means opposing abortion, we need a better conversation about the myriad ways human life is threatened today.

Today, the March for Life will bring together thousands of anti-abortion activists and conservative political leaders in Washington, as it does every year in the week before the anniversary of the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion.

The gathering offers an opportunity to reflect on what it means to defend life, especially at a time when the Trump administration is pushing policies that break up immigrant families, exacerbate inequality and poison our environment.

It's understandable that abortion remains a foundational issue for millions of Americans. Debates over when life begins, whether a fetus can feel pain and at what stage a pregnancy can be terminated raise profound moral and medical questions.

While interest groups on both sides of this contentious issue often use absolute claims and polarizing rhetoric to make their case, many Americans recognize the complexity of abortion should not be reduced to talking points or bumper stickers. In fact, a poll from Public Religion Research Institute found that 43 percent of respondents identified as both ""pro-choice"" and ""pro-life,"" a sign that binary categories are insufficient.

A more productive national discussion could start with acknowledging that the way we talk about abortion can't begin with a culture-war approach, and finally recognizing the limits of single-issue politics.

There is nothing ""pro-life"" about defending life in the womb while walking away from our collective obligations to care for the child once that baby is born. This is exactly what President Trump and many politicians such as Speaker Paul Ryan, who will speak at the march, do when they shred social safety nets, fail to fund health insurance programs for low-income children, and put tax cuts for the wealthiest few before the needs of those in poverty.

The president has won over many political and religious conservatives with his appointment of anti-abortion judges, including Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch. His administration pushed for expanded conscience exemptions to contraception coverage requirements in the Affordable Care Act, and like every Republican president since Ronald Reagan, he reinstated the so-called Mexico City policy, which forbids U.S. aid money going to any international group that funds or promotes abortion.

For some voters and political leaders, these checks on the scorecard are a sign that Trump passes the test.

There are signs that a more expansive understanding of what constitutes a ""life issue"" is challenging that narrow vision. Pope Francis, the world's most influential religious leader, is driving that conversation.

The pope strongly opposes abortion, but has also elevated what he calls an ""economy of exclusion and inequality"" that ""kills,"" the death penalty, climate change and the treatment of immigrants as central pro-life concerns.

When asked by reporters about President Trump's decision to rescind an Obama-era program that protected some 800,000 young immigrants brought to the United States as children, Francis didn't equivocate. ""The President of the United States presents himself as pro-life,"" the pope said, ""and if he is a good pro-lifer, he understands that family is the cradle of life and its unity must be protected.""

Climate change is ""one of the principal challenges facing humanity,"" according to the pope, a stark difference from a president who pulled out of the Paris climate agreement and who once called global warming a hoax invented by the Chinese.

Francis also helpfully rejects the kind of simple categorizations that limit American political debates. ""Everything is connected,"" he writes in ""Laudato Si,"" the first encyclical in the church's history to address environmental themes and climate change. Francis understands that climate change caused by human activity is already killing people in the poorest countries, and it contributes to a migrant crisis also exacerbated by war and economic exclusion.

When Pope Francis visited the United States in 2015, he linked the need to protect life in the womb with ""children who die of hunger or from bombings, immigrants who drown in the search for a better tomorrow ... and the environment devastated by man's predatory nature.""

Several U.S. Catholic bishops are taking the pope's lead.

Boston Cardinal Sean O'Malley, an influential advisor to the pope, calls immigration ""another pro-life issue."" Chicago Archbishop Blase Cupich views gun violence as an urgent pro-life concern, and is a leader who forges alliances with progressives and Democratic politicians who disagree with the church's position on abortion. In a speech to the Chicago Federation of Labor, the cardinal spoke of ""feeding the hungry, sheltering the homeless, protecting the unborn, caring for the sick and welcoming immigrants"" as part of a ""consistent ethic of solidarity.""

The language echoed the message of a previous Chicago cardinal, Joseph Bernardin, who in the 1980s became the most prominent American church leader. ""Those who defend the right to life of the weakest among us, must be equally visible in support of the quality of life of the powerless among us: the old and the young, the hungry and the homeless, the undocumented immigrant and the unemployed worker,"" Bernardin said in a 1983 speech at Fordham University.

Debates over abortion shouldn't stop. But let's make sure the conversation about protecting life and human dignity doesn't end there.

3482,4003,"The Evidence Is In: The Sex-Change Revolution Is Based on Ideology, Not Science","America is in the midst of what has been called a ""transgender moment.""

(Photo: Reuters)

Twenty-eight years ago, the release of ""When Harry Met Sally"" highlighted one big debate: whether men and women could really be just friends.

That question may still be up in the air, but now we are being forced to confront a more fundamental debate: whether men can really become women.

America is in the midst of what has been called a ""transgender moment."" In the space of a year, transgender issues went from something that most Americans had never heard of to a cause claiming the mantle of civil rights.

But can a boy truly be ""trapped"" in a girl's body? Can modern medicine really ""reassign"" sex? Is sex something ""assigned"" in the first place? What's the loving response to a friend or child experiencing a gender identity conflict? What should our law say on these issues?

These shouldn't be difficult questions.

Just a few years before ""When Harry Met Sally"" hit theaters, Dr. Paul McHugh thought he had convinced the vast majority of medical professionals not to go along with bold claims about sex and gender being proffered by some of his colleagues. And as chair of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins Medical School and psychiatrist-in-chief at Johns Hopkins Hospital, McHugh put a stop to sex-reassignment surgery at Hopkins.

Once the elite Johns Hopkins did this, many medical centers across the nation followed suit.

But in recent years we have seen a resurgence of these drastic procedures—not in light of new scientific evidence, mind you, but as a result of a growing ideological movement. Such is our transgender moment.

The people increasingly in the spotlight of this moment are children.

In the past 10 years, dozens of pediatric gender clinics have sprung up throughout the United States. In 2007, Boston Children's Hospital ""became the first major program in the United States to focus on transgender children and adolescents,"" as its own website brags.

A decade later, over 45 gender clinics opened their doors to our nation's children—telling parents that puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones may be the only way to prevent teen suicides.

Never mind that according to the best studies—the ones that even transgender activists themselves cite—80 to 95 percent of children with gender dysphoria will come to identify with and embrace their bodily sex.

Never mind that 41 percent of people who identify as transgender will attempt suicide at some point in their lives, compared to 4.6 percent of the general population. Never mind that people who have had transition surgery are 19 times more likely than average to die by suicide.

These statistics should stop us in our tracks. Clearly, we must work to find ways to effectively prevent these suicides and address the underlying causes. We certainly shouldn't be encouraging children to ""transition.""

Many psychologists and psychiatrists think of gender dysphoria as similar to other dysphorias, or forms of discomfort with one's body, such as anorexia. The feelings of discomfort can lead to mistaken beliefs about oneself or about reality, and then to actions in accordance with those false beliefs.

The most helpful therapies focus not on achieving the impossible—changing bodies to conform to thoughts and feelings—but on helping people accept and even embrace the truth about their bodies and reality.

Operating in the background is a sound understanding of physical and mental health—proper function of one's body and mind—and a sound understanding of medicine as a practice aimed at restoring health, not simply satisfying the desires of patients.

For human beings to flourish, they need to feel comfortable in their own bodies, readily identify with their sex, and believe that they are who they actually are.

In my new book, ""When Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender Moment,"" I argue that McHugh got it right. The best biology, psychology, and philosophy all support an understanding of sex as a bodily reality, and of gender as a social manifestation of bodily sex. Biology isn't bigotry.

In my book I offer a balanced approach to the policy issues, a nuanced vision of human embodiment, and a sober and honest survey of the human costs of getting human nature wrong.

Despite activists' best efforts to put up a unified front, Harry cannot become Sally. Activists' desperate insistence to the contrary suggests that the transgender moment is fleeting.

3483,4004,The Shape of Water Received 13 Academy Award Nominations - What Does This Tell Us?,"It seems that The Shape of Water celebrates ""love"" as defined however the characters choose to express it.

[PHOTO:SCREENCAPTURE/YOUTUBE/THESHAPEOFWATERTRAILER]

The Shape of Water received thirteen Academy Award nominations yesterday, one short of the record. The plot followsa mute custodian who develops a sexual relationship with a humanoid-amphibian creature.

Due to the film's graphic nudity, I will not see it. As to why it received so many nominations, I defer to a film critic who noted: ""Perhaps the best argument in its favor is that, in a weird way, it's a film that speaks to our times. One could interpret 'The Shape of Water' as being about a mute woman who finds her voice with the help of her gay and African American friends to take down the sexually predatory, bigoted patriarchy.""

It seems that The Shape of Water celebrates ""love"" as defined however the characters choose to express it.

""Speaking your truth""

The prevailing theme of our culture is the belief that truth is whatever you believe it to be. Oprah Winfrey made headlines in her Golden Globes speech when she announced, ""What I know for sure is that speaking your truth is the most powerful tool we all have.""

However, to claim that there is no such thing as absolute truth is to make an absolute truth claim. Nor does such a denial change the reality it denies.

More and more Americans are rejecting the concept of hell, but does their opinion change its existence? If I don't believe the Queen of England exists, does my aristocratic atheism change anything about her reign?

The denial of absolute truth also leads to ethical quicksand: Americans view the 9/11 attacks as cowardly terrorism, while al-Qaeda celebrates them as a courageous defense of Islam. Is each viewpoint just ""their truth""?

Of course, the rejection of objective truth leads inevitably to the rejection of objective sexual morality. Marriage becomes defined however its participants wish to define it. Your sexual identity is just that-yours. A sexual relationship between a human and a humanoid-amphibian creature becomes the plot for an Academy Award-nominated film.

If we disagree, we are labeled intolerant, bigoted, or worse.

One of the most powerful testimonies of deliverance from same-sex attraction I have ever seen is Emily Thomes's story. I strongly encourage you to watch her video. Appallingly, the ministry behind the video has received death threats. One person posted to Facebook, ""If I had the means, I would come there and kill every last one of you!""

""God designed the human machine to run on Himself""

Martin Luther observed, ""The first commandment will stand and remain, that God is our God; this will not be accomplished in the present, but in the life everlasting."" He is right, of course: we will not worship God fully and unconditionally until we are with him in heaven.

But consider what Luther concluded from this observation: ""All the other commandments will cease and end; for, in the life to come, the world will cease and end together with all external worship of God, all world policy and government; only God and the first commandment will remain everlastingly, both here and there.""

In heaven, we will not need commandments against idolatry, adultery, murder, and the rest. We will not need to be commanded to keep the Sabbath or to honor our parents. We will keep the first commandment, and all the others will flow from it.

Now consider the degree to which Luther's observation explains the moral morass of our day. If morality flows from worship in heaven, is not the same true on earth?

Humans were created to need intimate relationship with our Creator. In Mere Christianity, C. S. Lewis explained: ""God made us: invented us as a man invents an engine. A car is made to run on petrol, and it would not run properly on anything else. Now God designed the human machine to run on Himself. He Himself is the fuel our spirits were designed to burn, or the food our spirits were designed to feed on. There is no other. That is why it is just no good asking God to make us happy in our own way without bothering about religion. God cannot give us a happiness and peace apart from Himself, because it is not there.""

The UK recently appointed a minister for loneliness to deal with what Prime Minister Theresa May calls ""the sad reality of modern life"" for too many people. If we are children cut off from our Father, should we be surprised at the epidemic of loneliness in our culture?

Yesterday's violence in Kentucky is the eleventh school shooting this year and tragic proof that we need a Prince of Peace. According to Gallup, 77 percent of Americans say our moral values are getting worse.

A personal question

If we cut a flower at its roots, the flower inevitably dies. As Jesus noted, ""the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine"" (John 15:4).

According to our Lord, there's only one way to live with flourishing purpose: ""Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing"" (v. 5).

Is American society ""abiding"" in Jesus today? Here's a more personal question: Are you?

3484,4005,Important Pro-Life Goals for 2018 You Need to Know About,"(Photo: Reuters/Kevin Lamarque)

Just one short year ago, there was a considerable sense of doubt among some in the pro-life movement. Although there was palpable relief that Hillary Clinton was not elected president in November 2016, many still harbored concerns about President-elect Donald Trump. Trump certainly campaigned as an opponent of abortion in both the primary and the general election. However, unlike previous Republican presidential nominees, he did not have a track record of voting for pro-life bills or supporting pro-life initiatives. However, most pro-lifers have been pleasantly surprised by the Trump administration.

One of the president's first actions was to both reinstate and strengthen the Mexico City policy, which prevents foreign-aid money from being used to pay for abortions overseas. President Trump also defunded the United Nations Population Fund. It has a long history of involvement in China's brutal birth-limitation policy, which routinely included forced abortions. Finally, Trump's executive-branch appointments and his judicial nominees, especially Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, have received praise from pro-lifers. Of course, the work is far from over.

This year is shaping up to be an extremely important year for the pro-life movement. That is because Republican majorities in both the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate have made possible two important pro-life policy objectives. The first is to defund Planned Parenthood. The second is a federal ban on abortions after 20 weeks. Pro-lifers should move boldly, because the twin pro-life strategies of defunding big abortion and pursuing incremental legislation have proven to be very effective in the past. Some history is instructive. One of the most important legislative victories for pro-lifers was the passage of the Hyde Amendment in 1976. It prevents federal Medicaid dollars from being used to pay for elective abortions. After years of litigation, the Hyde Amendment was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1980, and the abortion rate has fallen nearly every year since then.

Additionally, both pro-life and pro-choice analysts agree that the amendment has reduced abortion rates. In my analysis of it, I find that it has saved 2.1 million lives between 1976 and 2016. The defunding of Planned Parenthood needs to be a priority. The upcoming Department of Justice investigation will almost certainly reveal damaging information about the organization. Furthermore, Republican elected officials should not be scared by the inevitable misinformation campaign that will take place. Ever since Texas defunded Planned Parenthood in 2011, the media have worked overtime to find evidence of a public-health crisis in the Lone Star State. However, most public-health trends are positive. Minor pregnancies and minor abortions in Texas are down by 33 percent and 49 percent, respectively, and there is no evidence of a significant increase in the rate of unintended pregnancies. The debate over a 20-week abortion ban will definitely shape public opinion in a way that will benefit the pro-life cause. Since 1973, the biggest gain in pro-life public sentiment occurred in the mid 1990s, during the congressional and national debates over banning partial-birth abortion. The media attention given to that gruesome practice made many Americans reconsider their position on abortion. Something similar could happen with the 20-week abortion ban. Such bans have been popular politically: 20 states have passed bans on abortion after 20 weeks. And a significant body of survey data shows that women and young adults are actually more likely to support a 20-week abortion ban than are other demographic groups.

Although we have not succeeded in overturning Roe. v Wade, we have enjoyed great success in reducing the abortion rate in the U.S. The abortion rate has been falling consistently for the past 34 years and is currently half of what it was in 1980. In fact, in 2014, the most recent year for which we have data, the abortion rate was lower than what it was in 1973, the year that Roe v. Wade was decided. Contrary to the claims of the mainstream media, the declines in the abortion rate are not due to increases in contraceptive use. Rates of unintended pregnancy have been fairly stable for much of the past 35 years. Instead, the main factor driving the decline in the abortion rate has been that a higher percentage of unintended pregnancies are being carried to term. Pro-life efforts to defund Big Abortion, pursue incremental legislation, and provide for the needs of pregnant women will continue to protect women — and their unborn children — for years to come.

3485,4006,Christians Are More Persecuted Than Any Other Faith Group,"The United States needs to take bold action to prevent Christianity in many countries from disappearing altogether.

Last month, we focused on hostility toward religion in America. This month, I would like to talk about hostility towards Christians worldwide.

A recent report by Aid to the Church in Need documents that persecution of Christians today is worse than at any time in history. ""Not only are Christians more persecuted than any other faith groups. But ever-increasing numbers are experiencing the very worst forms of persecution.""

In some countries the situation was already so severe, it is hard to imagine how it could be any worse. Other countries (like China) have seen intolerance on the rise, as evidenced by a clampdown on dissent clergy and the destruction of churches.

Most of the countries where persecution against Christians is the most intense are Muslim countries (though North Korea and China are notable exceptions). Former Representative Frank Wolf has been on Point of View many times and recently called for the United State to take ""bold action"" to prevent Christianity in Iraq from disappearing altogether. Of course, ISIS remains a threat to Iraq's minority groups but they also face threat from a Baghdad-sanctioned Shiite militia.

World Summit

Earlier this year, the World Summit in Defense of Persecuted Christians was held in Washington, D.C. More than 600 victims and advocates from 130 countries gathered to raise awareness of the plight of persecuted Christians.

Franklin Graham said that he ""spent time this week with two men whose brothers were among the Coptic Christians marched out on the beach in Libya and viciously beheaded by ISIS for refusing to deny Christ."" Some were surprised to hear the story of one of the men who actually was from Chad and had NOT been a Christian prior to the day of his beheading. As the terrorists gave each Christian a choice to deny Jesus or die, they came to this man from Chad. He answered, ""Their God is my God."" He was moved by the faith of these Christians and chose to die with them.

Vice President Mike Pence spoke at the summit. He observed, ""The reality is, across the wider world, the Christian faith is under siege. Throughout the world, no people of faith today face greater hostility or hatred than the followers of Christ."" He also added that he believed ""ISIS is guilty of nothing short of genocide against people of Christian faith and it is time people called it by name.""

During the summit's final session, the organizers put forth a declaration that called for all believers to declare their allegiance with those who suffer for Christ's name. They pledged to promote awareness of persecuted Christians as well as pray and urge other believers to pray for those being persecuted. It also called for churches and individual Christians to provide practical assistance to the persecuted church.

Ignored and Forgotten?

Whenever I do a radio program on the plight of persecuted Christians, I notice two things. First, the number of people who call into the program drops significantly. Second, a number of those who do call the program complain that we should be more concerned with what is happening in America.

I thought of this phenomenon when I read a commentary by Dennis Prager that asked: ""Why Don't Christians Help . . . Christians?"" He is asking a good question. He tells the story of how as a young American Jew he traveled to the Soviet Union and became the national spokesman for the Student Struggle for Soviet Jewry.

He spoke before synagogues of every denomination, Jewish federations, and Jewish groups on college campuses. For decades, virtually every synagogue in America has a ""Save Soviet Jewry"" sign in front of it. By contrast, he never saw a sign in front of a church that said ""Save Soviet Christians.""

Today Christians are being murdered and churches are being destroyed. We hear very little about it. Some of the attacks have made the news. More than 60 people were killed at the Our Lady of Salvation Church in Baghdad. Since that massacre, an estimated 100,000 Christians have left the country.

In Nigeria, armed men and bombers killed over 40 in a Christmas Eve attack. More than 200 Muslim rioters burned homes, churches, and police stations when the Nigerian people elected a Christian as president.

In Egypt, terrorists detonated a bomb at Saints Church in Alexandria as worshippers left a New Year's Eve service. The attack killed at least 23 of those attending Mass as the Coptic Christian church.

Recently we had Johnnie Moore on Point of View to talk about his new book The Martyr's Oath. He begins the book and began our interview by talking about attending a Bible school graduation ceremony. The students repeated this martyr's oath in which they pledged their lives and death to Jesus. He felt like he was standing in the book of Acts, witnessing ""a raw, first-century Christianity"" that he had been shielded from in America.

He has since asked himself, ""Why are so few of us in America willing to live for Jesus when others are so willing to die for him?"" He noted that seeing Jesus through the eyes of the persecuted church has transformed him.

How Should We Respond?

As a church there are many ways we can respond. We can encourage church members and missionaries to go to these persecuted Christians and minister to them. We can set aside time in church to pray for persecuted Christians. Since 1996, the World Evangelical Fellowship has coordinated efforts of churches and Christian organizations to institute the first International Day of Prayer for the Persecuted Church.

The Scriptures admonish us to pray for those who are being persecuted. Hebrews 13:3 says, ""Remember those in prison as if you were their fellow prisoners, and those who are mistreated as if you yourselves were suffering."" And Paul reminds us in 1 Corinthians 12:26 that, ""When one member suffers, all members suffer with it.""

What should you pray? Here are four prayer targets:

First, pray for courage. It takes courage to stand for Christ in a country that is hostile to your beliefs and actively persecutes you.

Second, pray for faith. Pray that these persecuted believers will grow in grace and increase in faith as they face persecution.

Third, pray for hope. It is hard to find reasons for hope in a world of persecution. Pray that they would be empowered and press on.

Finally, pray for help. Many of these persecuted Christians need food, medicine and finances to survive.

3486,4007,How to Stop Being a Hamster on the Ministry Wheel,"Do you feel like a hamster when it comes to your ministry?

(Screenshot: HelloDenizen/YouTube)

Have you ever watched a hamster running furiously around the inside of a hamster wheel and wondered, ""What is that little guy thinking?"" You watch it run and run and run, sometimes with bursts of energy, where you wonder if the hamster actually thinks it is making some kind of progress.

But it goes nowhere.

Sometimes that's what ministry can feel like.

Like hamsters running on a wheel to nowhere youth leaders run the cycle of annual priorities (camp, curriculum, rally, curriculum, retreat, curriculum, repeat) without ever asking the question, ""Are we getting anywhere?""

Too often the ministry wheel (that annual cycle of the way you've always done ministry) can run you, your adult leaders and your teenagers ragged...with little to show for all your efforts.

So how do we escape the hamster wheel? Here are 4 ways:

1. Take a break long enough to ask the really hard questions.

Get out of the hamster wheel so that you can pray, think and evaluate. Ask yourself hard questions like:

-How spiritually on-fire are my teenagers?

-Are my teenagers accelerating in their faith or just coming to youth group?

-Is my youth group growing because new disciples are being made and multiplied on a consistent basis?

Be brutally honest. Ask God for divine insight.

Consider getting away for a weekend to spend time thinking and praying about this. Read the the book of Acts and compare what you read in it with how you are running your youth ministry (or how it is running you!)

2. Re-discover your mission.

We don't technically need a youth group mission statement because Jesus already gave us the ultimate one in Matthew 28:19,20, ""Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.""

This is what we are called to do, to make and multiply disciples. If your youth group is more defined by meetings than accomplishing this mission then it has been ""hamsterized"", institutionalized, and needs freed from the ministry wheel.

A few years ago I wrote a book called Gospelize your Youth Ministry that unpacks how to build a youth ministry that advances the Gospel and makes disciples. It's all rooted in the seven values that drove the early church. These same values can drive your ministry too if you get out of the wheel long enough to figure it out.

3. Create a new cycle.

Sometimes we need to break the old cycle and accomplish your mission. If year after year you've been doing the same camp, same brand of curriculum, same old-same old and are getting the same results, it's time to break the cycle and create a new one.

Everything we do should go through a mission grid. ""Is this (camp, conference, curriculum, activity, etc) going to help us get from here to there?""

At Dare 2 Share we have seen youth leaders who have finally chosen to break the camp cycle and bring their teenagers to Lead THE Cause (our full week intensive training for disciple multiplication.) Many of them ask themselves afterward ""Why didn't I take my teenagers to this earlier?""

The answer is simple. They were stuck on the ministry wheel, going to the same camp year after year because, well, that's what they've always done and that's where they've always gone.

They discover that Lead THE Cause actually helps them, not only get off the ministry wheel, but escape the cage altogether. And now they have the beginnings of a youth group that is making progress toward the mission God has put in their hearts!

4. Ask God for his strength to escape the wheel!

Paul tells the Ephesians believers, ""be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power"" Ephesians 6:10. This same power is available to you and me. God will give you the strength to escape the ministry wheel if you yield to his indwelling Spirit and take a courageous step of faith.

The collective power of the Trinity is available to you to escape the ministry wheel. Unleash it through faith and escape!

Let's stop running around in circles. Let's start accomplishing the mission God has placed in our hearts!

After all, we're not hamsters! We're ambassadors of the King!

3514,4036,The Media Continues to Shout Their Abortion Bias,"If ever we needed a reminder of the media's extreme pro-abortion bias we sure witnessed it with the coverage of last week's two marches.

(Photo: The Christian Post/Samuel Smith)

If ever we needed a reminder of the media's extreme pro-abortion bias, we received it with their coverage of last week's two marches, the March for Life on Friday and the Women's March on Saturday. The first event was all but ignored, aside from President Trump's historic address to the march; the second event was celebrated and glorified and magnified.

The differences in coverage were so glaring as to be embarrassing. But within the echo chamber of leftist media, the bias is so ingrained that it is not even noticed. And it is hardly anything new.

In fact, in 1981, professors S. Robert Lichter and Stanley Rothman ""released a groundbreaking survey of 240 journalists at the most influential national media outlets — including the New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Time, Newsweek, U.S. News & World Report, ABC, CBS, NBC and PBS — on their political attitudes and voting patterns."" The survey found these ""media elites"" to be shockingly liberal, to the point that ""54 percent did not regard adultery as wrong, compared to only 15 percent [of the general public] who regarded it as wrong.""

Not only so, but ""90 percent agree that a woman has the right to decide for herself whether to have an abortion; 79 percent agree strongly with this pro-choice position."" This was in 1981. Little has changed to this day, aside from alternative voices being raised up to combat this one-sided narrative.

From 1987-1996, my family lived in Maryland, immediately outside of Washington, DC, and many of our friends were on the front lines of the pro-life movement. One year, a number of us participated in an Operation Rescue event and were arrested at a local abortion clinic. This barely made the news, despite a fairly substantial turnout.

The next day was the massive March for Life, attended by multiplied tens of thousands of peaceful protestors. And it took place right in our back yard, certainly worthy of local news, not to mention national news. There were also a handful of pro-abortion protestors at the event, but they were outnumbered by 500 or even 1,000 to 1.

That night we gathered around our TVs to watch the 11:00 PM local news, and there was not a mention of the march until the closing minutes of the broadcast. And this despite the fact that the march was far and away the most momentous local event of the week (or month?), let alone of the day.

And how did the stations cover the event? They did not show the massive crowds. Instead, they interviewed a couple of pro-life marchers and a couple of pro-abortion protestors, giving the idea that they were equal in number. We were grieved but not surprised.

Not much has changed today, and if not for President Trump addressing the March for Life, which was participating in the longest-lasting protest march in our nation's history (tragically), it appears there would have been a virtual media blackout of the event.

But this year, the media were able to display their bias even more dramatically, not just covering the women's march (which included many a staunch pro-abortion feminist) but actually celebrating it.

The Right Scoop website counted tweets from CNN and CNN Breaking News on both events. The totals?

For the March for Life, there were zero tweets from CNN's Breaking News and two from CNN's main account, both focusing on the president's address, where, we were told, he touted his ""anti-abortion"" record. In contrast, CNN's Breaking News tweeted 10 timesabout the women's march while CNN's main account tweeted 18 times.

It's worth looking at the page to see the tweets and pictures for yourself. Talk about shouting out your bias.

But once again, this is nothing new. One year ago, Newsbusters carried this shocking headline: ""Networks Cover Women's March 129x More Than March for Life."" Yes, 129 times.

What is really tragic is that many people get their news from the liberal media, because of which they have a skewed sense of reality, not even knowing what is taking place in their own nation.

All the more, then, do we have the responsibility to challenge the integrity of the leftist media, to expose its biases loudly and clearly, and to determine to get the truth out – sans our own biases – for the world to hear.

And we do this with confidence, not despair, knowing that in the end, truth will always triumph. As the apostle Paul wrote, ""For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth"" (2 Corinthians 13:8).

Who knows? We might even see a shift in media perspectives in our lifetimes.

3515,4037,Collateral Damage of Hormone Drugs,"Handing out hormone drugs like candy to prevent pregnancy can be deadly to girls.

Expand | Collapse Alvimann Morguefile.com

Planned Parenthood clinics across the country provide young girls with birth control pills, morning-after drugs, IUDs, hormone-delivering injections, the Patch and NuvaRings—and if those fail, help arrange for abortions. Schools can also be birth control providers under the guise of helping girls stay in school and avoid unplanned pregnancies.

There's plenty of research on the psychological implications of having sex too young. And as Christians we read in the Bible about God's thoughts on the subject, but has anyone researched the long-term medical complications that can occur in young girls receiving high levels of hormones during puberty? Hormones are not innocent drugs. I learned this by experience.

During my mom's pregnancy with me, her doctor gave her a new drug that supposedly helped prevent miscarriage. Diethylstibetrol (DES) was a synthetic form of the hormone estrogen. Mom dutifully took it daily throughout her pregnancy and experienced no complications.

Then 16 years later complications arose—not in her, but in me. The DES caused clear cell adenocarcinoma —and cases all over the country were cropping up in other ""DES daughters"".

Less than a decade later, I had a miscarriage, followed by giving birth prematurely at 32 weeks. Why? Deformed uterus caused by DES. Then, six years later, my mom died of breast cancer—DES gave the women who took it a 30 percent increased chance of developing that disease.

For all of these young girls being given hormone drugs—there may be a cost to pay in the future. Who will they blame? Schools? Government? We need to consider the drugs we hand out freely in the very schools that teach students about drug abuse.

3516,4038,Why a Palestinian Christian Is Wrong About Jerusalem,"With all respect to Dr. Sara as my brother in the Lord, and having shared with him privately that I'd be responding to his article, allow me to address the issues he raises.

Michael Brown holds a Ph.D. in Near Eastern Languages and Literatures from New York University and has served as a professor at a number of seminaries. He is the author of 25 books and hosts the nationally syndicated, daily talk radio show, the Line of Fire.

According to evangelical Christian leader Johnnie Moore, President Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel is a good thing for the Palestinians. According to Rev. Dr. Jack Sara, a Palestinian Christian living in Jerusalem, Moore has seriously missed the mark. In fact, in Sara's view, since Trump's decision was strongly encouraged by evangelical Christians, that very name – evangelical – now has a negative connotation among the Palestinian people, making it all the more difficult for the Palestinian Christians living there. What are we to make of these concerns?

Sara writes with a gracious tone, saying, ""My critique is from an evangelical perspective and it is a plea to my brethren across the water."" But he is forthright in his convictions, claiming that the term ""evangelical"" has ""become increasingly despised in our region and that the ""uncritical support of Israel"" by evangelicals ""is blinding their eyes to the injustices committed in the land.""

He blames this further on the alleged ""distorted interpretation of Scripture"" held to by evangelicals, asking, ""What is their good news to the Palestinians? What is their Gospel for the Arab nations?""

With all respect to Dr. Sara as my brother in the Lord, and having shared with him privately that I'd be responding to his article, allow me to address the issues he raises.

First, in 1972, as a weeks-old, Jewish believer in Jesus, the local rabbi gave me a book on anti-Semitism in Church history, outlining one of the major reasons many Jews do not believe in Jesus. Non-baptized Jews were exiled from numerous countries; Jews were slaughtered in the Crusades (including European Jews, whose sin was to be Jewish); Martin Luther counseled that rabbis be forbidden to teach on penalty of death – and on and on it goes.

As evil and anti-Christian as the Holocaust was, it found a ready home in anti-Semitic Europe, the result of centuries of ""Christian"" anti-Semitism.

Now, after such a long and ugly history, evangelical Christian love for Israel has won the hearts of many Israelis, and Jewish leaders around the world recognize the sincerity – even the altruism – of this love, thereby recovering some of the testimony of Jesus that has been lost.

Dr. Sara, can you rejoice with me that this has taken place? Since these are the Messiah's own flesh and blood, the ones for whom Paul agonized (in Romans 9), shouldn't you, as a follower of Jesus be glad? ""Evangelical"" has hardly become a dirty word among Israeli Jews.

Second, the gospel for the Arab nations is the same as the gospel for the Hindu nations and Buddhist nations – and for the Jewish people themselves. You can receive forgiveness of your sins through the blood the cross! You can receive a new heart and become a child of God through the death and resurrection of Jesus! Repent and believe!

Isn't that message enough? Why must it also have territorial promises tied in with it?

Third, God did promise the physical land of Israel to the Jewish people before the Law was given at Sinai, and as Paul explained in Galatians 3, the Law, which was 430 years after the promise, cannot nullify the promise. As for the perpetuity of that promise, could God have made Himself any clearer? ""He remembers his covenant forever, the word that he commanded, for a thousand generations, the covenant that he made with Abraham, his sworn promise to Isaac, which he confirmed to Jacob as a statute, to Israel as an everlasting covenant, saying, 'To you I will give the land of Canaan as your portion for an inheritance.'"" (Ps. 105:8-11)

You might say, ""But that's not fair.""

May I ask you, dear brother, why everyone else gets a homeland but the Jewish people don't get one, even a tiny one in the Middle East? If my calculations are right, the physical land of Israel constitutes roughly 1/650th of the surrounding Arab and Muslim land. Is it so terrible that we Jews have a homeland?

Fourth, when there was plenty of room for Jews and Arabs to dwell side by side in what was then called Palestine in the 1930s, the Muslim leadership was offered a two-state solution. The Jewish leadership accepted the offer; the Muslim leadership refused.

The same thing happened in 1947. The Jewish leadership accepted the two-state solution, echoing the sentiments of David Ben Gurion, who said in 1937, ""We do not wish and do not need to expel Arabs and take their place. All our aspiration is built on the assumption – proven throughout all our activity in the Land of Israel – that there is enough room in the country for ourselves and the Arabs.""

The Muslim leadership refused, calling for war instead. In the words of Azzam Pasha, Secretary-General of the Arab League, October 11, 1947, ""It will be a war of annihilation. It will be a momentous massacre in history that will be talked about like the massacres of the Mongols or the Crusades.""

Isn't that still the attitude of Hamas, rightly branded a terrorist group by America? And isn't it true that the Palestinian Authority (PA) still rewards the families of terrorists who slaughter Israeli children, women, and men? And isn't it true that, the vast majority of Israel's 1.5 million Arab citizens prefer living under Israeli rule rather than under the rule of Hamas or the PA?

Perhaps Israel is not the primary cause of Palestinian suffering? Perhaps the greater cause is the Palestinian Muslim leadership?

Fifth, if I follow your logic, then the only way Palestinians will be happy with evangelical Christians is if we renounce reality and say that Jerusalem is not the capital of Israel, when in fact it is the capital, both in history and at present. Conversely, as you surely know, Jerusalem has never been the capital of a Palestinian state. Why, now, must E. Jerusalem be the capital of Palestine? Based on what criteria?

Unfortunately, as noted by one pro-Israel blogger, you are basically stating ""that without antisemitism, the Arabs won't listen to the message of Christ."" In other words, unless Christians worldwide take an anti-Israel position and refuse to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Muslims won't receive the gospel. Dr. Sara, do you really believe this?

The good news is that, around the world, not only are Muslims coming to Jesus in unprecedented numbers, but many of them are becoming staunch lovers of Israel, recognizing that it is Satan who wants to destroy the Jewish people and that Jew-hatred is all too present in Islamic tradition.

On a recent trip to Germany, I met some former Muslims from Iran and Turkey and Syria. We hugged and rejoiced together, as they told me in their imperfect English how much they loved Jesus and how much they loved the Jews. This is but one anecdotal example out of countless thousands.

I know some Palestinian Christians who feel the same way, yet they have been beaten and threatened by their Muslim neighbors because of their pro-Israel stance.

Perhaps, Dr. Sara, they are not all reading the Bible wrongly? Perhaps they recognize that, as surely as God is God, His love for Israel remains the same, despite our many sins (Romans 11:28-29)?

Sixth, I do not minimize injustices you and your friends may have suffered, and I do not believe Israel is faultless, not historically and not today. I do my best to address areas of concerns when my Jewish brothers fall short, so yes, we are joined together in Jesus to stand for justice. Where I have a blind spot to these injustices, by all means, help me to see more clearly.

I simply appeal to you to reconsider your understanding of the Scriptures when it comes to Israel, to ask yourself if your bad experiences have blinded your eyes to the plain teaching of the Bible, and to do what the Lord enjoined in the Psalms and in Isaiah (Psalm 22 and Isaiah 62), namely, to pray for a Jewish Jerusalem to become the praise of all the earth.

Let the discussion continue.

3517,4039,There Is Actually a Great Deal of Evidence for the Christian Worldview,"It is true that a theistic God exists? Go ahead, and test your knowledge.

Can Christianity be proven? Contrary to popular belief that the Christian faith is based on unproven assumptions, there is actually a great deal of evidence for the Christian worldview. This is a 12 point reasoning process, in extremely short form, indicating a reasoning route beginning at ""Can truth be known?""

1. Truth about reality is knowable.

a. The phrase ""all truth is relative"" actually contradicts itself, the statement is making an objective claim while at the same time suggesting that all ideas must be relative. That is an obvious contradiction. (Road-runner tactic)

b. All sorts of facts are knowable, such as: mathematics, history, science, rules of logic, finances, and systems of law. The whole world functions on objective truths; philosophy and religion don't become ""relative"" just because it's intellectually convenient.

c. We don't need absolute proof to take action, we only need proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

2. The law of non-contradictionindicates that what is opposite of true must be false.

3. It is true that a theistic God exists.

a. The fine tuning of the universe proves God exists

b. The fact of a cosmic beginning shows that God exists

c. The order and design in nature and human DNA proves that God exists

d. The reality of good and evil and objective morality proves that God exists

e. Only an infinite God with infinite power could create the universe, time, space and humanity. Aninfinite God is singular, in that multiple gods could not all be infinite, only one God is needed, an infinite God, therefore God must be a theistic God, one God.

4. If God exists then miracles are possible.

a. An infinite God can interact within the universe He created in any way he desires, so miracles are not a problem for this theistic God.

5. Miracles are useful as evidence and confirmation of a message from God.

6. The Bible is historically reliable.

a. Over 5,000 manuscripts validate the Bible as unaltered and historically reliable

b. Archaeological evidence agrees with biblical descriptions of history.

c. Respected ancient historians cite facts that match with the biblical narrative

7. The New Testament says that Jesus claimed to be God.

a. ""I and the Father are one."" –John 10:30 ESV

b. Jesus said to them, ""Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am."" –John 8:58 ESV

c. ""So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath."" –Mark 2:28 NIV

8. Jesus' claim to be God was miraculously confirmed by:

a. His fulfillment of many prophecies about himself

b. His sinless and miraculous life

c. His crucifixion and resurrection

9. Therefore, Jesus is God.

10. Whatever Jesus (Who is God) teaches must be true.

a. If Jesus Christ is God, then anything Jesus teaches must be absolutely true, given the requirements for God include infinite knowledge, infinite ability, moral purity, and a living embodiment of the truth.

11. Jesus taught that the Bible is the word of God.

a. ""For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass from the Law until all is accomplished,"" Matt. 5:18 NASB

b. ""The Scripture cannot be broken"" –John 10:35b NASB

c. ""Your word is truth"" –John 17:17b NASB

12. Therefore it is true that the Bible is the word of God.

If Jesus Christ is really God, then the Bible must be the word of God, because Jesus considered the Bible the word of God. Given these 12 points, Christianity is true beyond a reasonable doubt.

How should you respond? First step, do more research. Second step, think about it. Third step, actually pray about it and ask God to reveal himself to you.

From a basis of imperative (necessity) the greatest question of life itself must be: How can we overcome death? The clock is after all ticking for all of us. Well, there is only one who has successfully overcome death.

Did Jesus Christ really rise from the dead? If Jesus Christ really did rise from the dead, then he can do the same for us, as God, and for that reason, eternal life, the holy grail itself becomes available to us!

If the reasoning is sound, and you've come to believe that these facts are true, then commit your life to Jesus Christ, commit to serve Him and live by his standards put forth in the New Testament. And you will live forever. It's as simple as that. Believe on Jesus Christ, believe God raised him from the dead, and commit your way to his teachings. If the goal is to believe what is actually true, then you ought to believe Christianity.

3518,4040,"West Coast Fears of Tsunami After Earthquake, Evangelist Luis Palau and Humility","(Photo: Reuters) A massive tsunami sweeps in to engulf a residential area after a powerful earthquake in Natori, Miyagi Prefecture in northeastern Japan, on March 11, 2011. (Reuters/KYODO)

The news consistently reminds us that we are not the captains of our fate. For instance, a 7.9 magnitude earthquake off the southern coast of Alaska early this morning has prompted fearsof a tsunami that could reach the West Coast. Despite all our scientific advances, humans are no match for the power of nature.

A new study suggests that the Black Death, a plague that killed 30 to 60 percent of Europe's population, was caused not by fleas spread on rats but by human fleas and body lice. Not only did we not know how to stop the plague–until now, we didn't even know what caused it.

Jacksonville Jaguars cornerback Jalen Ramsey guaranteed that his team would defeat the New England Patriots in last Sunday's game and then win the Super Bowl. Patriots defensive tackle Adam Butler responded: ""Be humble or be humbled."" We now know which transpired.

A life of humility

Evangelist Luis Palau is one of the godliest and most gracious men I have ever met. His sparkling wit and infectious passion for Jesus have attracted millions of people to our Lord.

He has spoken to thirty million people in seventy-five countries across his ministry, authored dozens of books, and been featured in radio broadcasts on 3,500 radio outlets in forty-eight countries. When he preached at the last church I pastored, his message exalted Jesus in a way I will never forget.

Now he has announced that he has Stage 4 lung cancer. ""Everything is ready and if the Lord wants to take me home in the next few months or two years or whatever it is, I'm ready,"" he said in a video I hope you'll watch today.

One of the most impactful attributes of Rev. Palau's life and ministry is his genuine humility. He believes passionately that his salvation and ministry are God's gifts of grace. He points people to Jesus rather than himself because he knows our souls need not a man but the Master.

I recently read this statement from Charles Spurgeon: ""The more thou hast, the more thou art in debt to God; and thou shouldst not be proud of that which renders thee a debtor.""

The priority of humility

C. J. Mahaney is the author of Humility: True Greatness. This pastor's insightful description of the biblical path from pride to humility is transformational reading. I was given a copy of his book recently and profited from it greatly.

Mahaney begins with God's promise from Isaiah 66:2: ""This is the one to whom I will look: he who is humble and contrite in spirit and trembles at my word."" This promise causes him to note that ""humility draws the gaze of our Sovereign God.""

Just as our humility honors God, the converse is true: honoring God leads to humility. Mahaney quotes John Calvin: ""It is evident that man never attains to a true self-knowledge until he has previously contemplated the face of God, and come down after such contemplation to look into himself."" Calvin's observation leads to Mahaney's definition: ""Humility is honestly assessing ourselves in light of God's holiness and our sinfulness.""

Choosing humility involves the following theological commitments:

• View pride as ""the essence of all sin"" (John Stott) and ""an abomination to the Lord"" (Proverbs 16:5).

• Remember that ""God opposes the proud"" (James 4:6; 1 Peter 5:5) because our pride contends with his sovereignty.

• Define greatness as serving others for the glory of God: ""Whoever would be great among you must be your servant, and whoever would be first among you must be slave of all"" (Mark 10:43-44).

• Ask God to rescue you from pride, depending on the One who ""came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many"" (Matthew 20:28).

The path to humility

Next, Mahaney offers several practical steps toward humility. The first and most important is to reflect often on the wonder of the cross, beginning your day by acknowledging your dependence on God and your need for God.

He quotes John Stott: ""Nothing in history or in the universe cuts us down to size like the cross. All of us have inflated views of ourselves, especially in self-righteousness, until we have visited a place called Calvary. It is there, at the foot of the cross, that we shrink to our true size.""

Now begin your day by expressing gratefulness to God. Spend time in the spiritual disciplines of prayer, Bible study, and worship. Memorize Scripture, especially on your commute or during what Mahaney calls ""mundane moments."" Cast your cares upon Jesus (1 Peter 5:6-7), as this will cause you to realize your need for your Lord. And end your day by expressing gratitude to God for his grace and for the gift of sleep.

There's much more in Mahaney's wonderful exposition. That's why I hope you'll read it and apply its truths personally.

The mystery of humility

Faith does not exempt us from the peril of pride. Mahaney quotes John Owen's warning: ""There is no duty we perform for God that sin does not oppose. And the more spirituality or holiness there is in what we do, the greater is its enmity to it. Thus, those who seek the most for God experience the strongest opposition.""

The more you serve Jesus, the more opposition you will face, but the more you will experience his abundant life (John 10:10). And the closer you get to God, the farther away you will realize you are.

That's the challenge, the joy, and the mystery of humility.

3519,4041,Why Christian Theology Was Necessary for Science,"REUTERS/FRED PROUSER A full scale model of the Mars Science Laboratory's (MSL) Curiosity rover is pictured at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab.

To paraphrase Mark Twain, reports of the rift between science and Christianity have been greatly exaggerated.

Scientist Richard Dawkins, the combative author of ""The God Delusion,"" has said, ""Faith can be very, very dangerous, and deliberately to implant it into the vulnerable mind of an innocent child is a grievous wrong."" I wonder why the good doctor doesn't just go ahead and tell us how he really feels?

Seeing such vitriolic quotes from high-profile scientists such as Dr. D, it's no wonder that so many Christians believe that most scientists hate God, Christians, and religious faith. The good news is, it is simply not true!

That's according to a fascinating new book, ""Religion vs. Science: What Religious People Really Think,"" by Elaine Howard Ecklund of Rice University and Christopher Scheitle of West Virginia University. As reported in Christianity Today, Ecklund and Scheitle found that, based on data from a nationally representative survey of 10,000 Americans, evangelicals are just as likely as most Americans to count scientists as close friends—but they tend to assume their friends are the exceptions, that most scientists want nothing to do with them.

And while only 40 percent of all scientists say they believe in God, and about half have no religious affiliation, Ecklund and Scheitle found that a full 65 percent of those working in practical scientific fields such as medicine and engineering identify as Christians, including 24 percent as evangelicals.

Apparently there's a link between faith traditions that emphasize helping other people and the kinds of professions that actually do so—who knew? Down through the centuries, of course, Christians have been eager to help the sick and many of us have taken to heart God's call to be His stewards in the world, caring for and developing His creation, so these figures are no surprise.

We're not doing quite as well in the basic and more theoretical sciences, however. Ecklund and Scheitle suspect there isn't as strong a connection between our religious values and basic science, observing, ""[I]t would be easier to see 'new medical discoveries' as spiritually connected to the ideals of faith than it would be to see 'new scientific discoveries' as promoting faith ideas.""

But of course the connection between scientific discovery and a Christian worldview is as strong as an electric current running through water. Years ago, Chuck Colson reminded us that many of the great scientists of history—Copernicus in astronomy and Newton in physics, among them—made epochal discoveries while operating out of a Christian worldview.

That worldview says that God created the universe out of nothing, that He has set up a series of observable, rational laws to govern it, and that mankind—male and female—has been created in His image with the God-given ability to discover things about the physical world and bring order and blessing to it. As the eminent historian Rodney Stark has written, ""Christian theology was necessary for the rise of science."" Indeed!

Yes, sometimes certain modern scientific trends and spokespeople have anti-religious agendas. But let's never fear the battle, remembering that when we engage in science, we are firmly on our heavenly Father's home turf.

Ecklund and Scheitle, for their part, suggest that our churches should take a more active role in recognizing and promoting science as a calling from God. They say that the church needs ""faith leaders to celebrate the scientists within their congregations, and they need these scientists to speak out about how scientific knowledge is not a threat to their faith.""

So while the rift between science and faith may have been greatly exaggerated, we still have some work to do.

3520,4042,Why Does God Allow So Much Affluence?,"Why do some people seem to never get a break in life, while many never seem to miss a beat?

Expand | Collapse

Multitudes of people over the centuries have wrestled with the question, ""Why does God allow so much suffering?"" On the flip side of that issue I wonder, ""Why does God allow so much affluence?""

After all, Jesus issued this clear warning: ""I tell you the truth, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."" (Matthew 19:23,24)

Why then do you suppose God allows so much affluence, given how dangerous the love of money and the pursuit of materialism is to a person's soul? Jesus cut to the chase by asking, ""What does it profit a man to gain the whole world, and yet lose his own soul?"" (Mark 8:36)

And yet in spite of the solemn risk, throngs of people seem willing to give anything in exchange for loads of money and a ton of possessions. Jesus addressed this pitfall by declaring what has become a well-known biblical principle: ""You cannot serve both God and money."" (Matthew 6:24)

The apostle Paul expressed the danger this way: ""People who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs."" (1 Timothy 6:9,10)

Nevertheless, God has given man the option to pursue a life of extravagance and riches. Ultimately, it is a test of one's allegiance. Will I choose to worship created things, or the Creator Himself?

The Bible describes how centuries ago people ""exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator - who is forever praised."" (Romans 1:25) The same error goes on all the time today.

You assume that you own your things, when in reality, they may very well be owning you. And so it's no surprise that ""the abundance of a rich man permits him no sleep."" (Eccl. 5:12)

When you worship things, you are left high and dry; whereas when you worship your Creator, you engage in an activity that will take place in heaven forever. And while the joy and contentment of paradise will never end, the person who loves money and worships wealth will have a far different experience throughout eternity.

As you look at your life today, ask yourself this question: ""Am I consumed by the love of God and a desire to help others know Christ, or by the love of money and the obsession to get rich?"" No heart is capable of being consumed by both of those goals at the same time because they are polar opposites. And at the end of the day, ""A man is a slave to whatever has mastered him."" (2 Peter 2:19)

The wisdom of Solomon revealed this fact: ""Whoever loves money never has money enough; whoever loves wealth is never satisfied with his income."" (Ecclesiastes 5:10) In other words, those who chase after riches dig a bottomless pit for themselves.

No wonder Jesus spent most of His earthly ministry reaching out to the poor, rather than hobnobbing with rich folks. Remember that it was Christ who said, ""When you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, and you will be blessed."" (Luke 14:13,14)

Nearly one-half of the world's population live on less than $2.50 a day. Meanwhile, there are scores of people on the planet who adhere to Warren Buffett's famous admonition: ""Rule No. 1: Never lose money. Rule No. 2: Don't forget rule No. 1.""

Now compare that worldview to what Christ said concerning man's immortal soul. You could sum up the Lord's approach to money and eternity this way: ""Rule No. 1: Never lose your soul. Rule No. 2: Don't forget rule No. 1.""

It has been 2600 years since the prophet Daniel was given profound spiritual insight into future events. Daniel wrote, ""Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake: some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt. Those who are wise will shine like the brightness of the heavens, and those who lead many to righteousness like the stars forever and ever."" (Daniel 12:2,3)

And so the question remains: With eternity hanging in the balance, why does God allow so much affluence?

While we may not have all the answers to this puzzling question, Scripture does reveal why God sent His only Son to be sacrificed on the cross. ""God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life."" (John 3:16)

The wealth of this world is pitiful and paltry when compared to the glorious riches of Christ and His eternal kingdom. I guess that leaves each one of us with a monumental decision in front of us. And the stakes couldn't be any higher.

Here's How Followers of Christ Should Respond to the Unrest in America","I, like the rest of the country, cannot understand how an institution full of highly-educated men and women cannot do what millions of Americans do every week—balance their budget. I am frustrated with the President's and Congress's games and excuses while hardworking men and women (many of whom put their lives on the line every day) will suffer because they won't do their jobs.

In the ongoing news cycle of discouraging situations one after another, how do we as followers of Christ respond? God often uses the following five biblical truths to remind me Who's in control when life seems out of control.

I had you all along. God won't fail us. He promises us this in Hebrews 13:5, ""I will never leave you nor forsake you"" (ESV). He is active in every part of our lives and our family's lives. I am working. In John 5:17 Jesus said, ""My Father is working until now, and I am working."" Every part of our lives is important to God and He is always working in our lives even when we don't see evidence. The Bible is full of examples of God working through and in spite of the craziness of the world. Jesus' life is the perfect example. Only Mary, Joseph, Elizabeth, and Zacharias knew Who He was and His purpose for coming to earth. Jesus dealt with persecution from His own people, the Roman government, and the religious leaders. From the outside it seemed His life was discouraging and off-track at times, but all along God was working His plan. You have not missed anything. If there is one message that social media preaches louder than any other, it is this—You are missing out! It has been given a name—FOMO (fear of missing out). It is the job of social media to convince you that you are missing out so you better stay connected online at all times. When current events bring uncertainty, the temptation is to be glued to whatever medium we use for the news. We look to others' social media posts to give us insights and comfort, assuming they have the inside scoop. But the truth is only God knows all. He will tell us what we need to know when we need to know it. 2 Peter 1:3, ""I can pray this because His divine power has bestowed on us everything necessary for life and godliness through the rich knowledge of the one who called us by his own glory and excellence"" (NET). We need to be alert and listening to Him. I am not holding out on you. We want what we want and we want it now. We are basically two-year-olds. But the truth is if what we want would be good for us, God would make sure we had it and now. Psalm 84:11, ""For the LORD God is a sun and shield; the LORD bestows favor and honor. No good thing does He withhold from those who walk uprightly"" (ESV). When we don't understand what God is up to, we must make a decision—to acknowledge God as our sovereign LORD, trusting Him; or not to trust Him because He has not shown us ""the big plan."" Faith trusts. Disbelief demands answers. I have given you all you need. We live in a country where we can get hot coffee on any street corner and order an item online and it will be delivered within an hour, two days at the most. We have news and entertainment literally at our fingertips. Yet, we live with the scarcity mentality—there's not enough for me. Through Moses' life God shows us, ""I have given you all you need."" Throughout his life, God communicated with Moses in a way Moses could hear. Moses leaned in and listened to God and then did what God told him to do. Throughout his life, God provided for Moses and the Hebrews by giving them manna and keeping their clothes from wearing out. God will give us what we need as we need it. We only need to listen and look for it. Enjoy Today. Life is a process. Life does not consist of many easy days strung together with a hard one every so often. Each day provides its own challenges. Jesus told us as much, ""So then, do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Today has enough trouble of its own"" (Matthew 6:34, NET). Our pastor recently reminded us that Jesus has today taken care of; so I can enjoy today. Enjoying today requires that I am present in the moments and not rushing through to get to the end of the day. It means I acknowledge and thank God for all I call good in my life—my family, friends, home, our church, work, etc. Today and all the blessings it brings are a gift from God. I can enjoy them even when I don't have answers or power to change the crazy in our country.

Yes, we have the responsibility to participate in our government—vote, call your Congressperson, pray for our leaders. But remember that ultimately it is God Who directs the leaders' hearts (Proverbs 21:1). And because of this we have peace.

3540,4062,Emily Thomes' Journey to God,"When someone states that he or she was ""born this way,"" maybe the most biblical response is, ""me too.""

[PHOTO: FACEBOOK/EMILYTHOMES]

When someone states that he or she was ""born this way,"" maybe the most biblical response is, ""me too.""The Huffington Post is all in a huff over a stupendous viral video about homosexuality and the Gospel—a video that's racked up nearly 2 million views. Created by the Christian media ministry Anchored North, this production gives every appearance of being just another ""coming out"" story by a lesbian woman.

Emily Thomes tells of how it ""went terribly"" when she revealed her first romantic relationship with a woman to her father. In her Southern lilt, she describes the conviction at age twenty that if anyone in the Bible Belt was truly a Christian, they would approve of her lifestyle. ""If not,"" she says, ""then you were legalistic and you needed to re-read what God was really about: 'Judge not.'""

Then, at twenty-two, Thomes was invited to attend a ladies' Bible study. Certain the women would reject her, she gave it the old college try. But something strange happened. Thomes was not shunned by these Christian women. As a result, she began asking herself questions: ""What if it's all true? Are you sure this is who you are?""

She turned to the Bible to see if her ideas about what real Christians believe were accurate, and soon found herself in the sin list of 1 Corinthians 6. Paul's promise of judgement, she says, scared her. ""I realized I was in the 'will not enter the kingdom of God' lineup."" And then she read verse 11: ""And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified.""

The freedom promised in this verse ultimately opened her eyes. ""I could hold onto my sin and reject God,"" she says, ""or I could turn to Him. All the debt that I racked up living like I had lived didn't have to be mine...""

Predictably, HuffPo slams Thomes' story as a commercial for the ""scientifically discredited and flat-out lethal idea that gay, lesbian, or bisexual people can change their sexual orientation if they pray hard enough."" They quote one so-called ""queer Christian writer and pastor"" who insists ""a robust, Christ-centered"" theology teaches that God accepts every lifestyle, that He is ""all gracious, all merciful, and extends forgiveness and love to absolutely everyone.""

The irony is that Thomes would agree that God extends forgiveness and love to all. The difference is that her idea of forgiveness involves repentance, and being born again.

People regularly confront her with the refrain of the LGBT movement: ""I was born this way."" Her reply? ""Yeah, me too. You're not born with right affections. That's why Jesus had to come. You're feeling a desire for sin just proves you need grace like me.""

This answer is more than just a good one. It's the definitive response from a Christian worldview to those who insist sexual desires define them.

What Thomes' story so beautifully portrays and what proves to be such a stumbling block to the editorial staff at the Huffington Post is a little something called the Gospel. It's the same message preached by other disciples called out of the gay lifestyle, like Rosaria Butterfield, who no longer identify themselves by their desires, but in Christ.

Secular news outlets want to associate this with so-called ""conversion therapy,"" the once popular practice of trying to clinically ""cure"" homosexuality. But as Thomes says, the transformation we undergo in Christ isn't from gay to straight. Despite being happily married in the Lord today, she reminds viewers that ""God calls us not to heterosexuality but to holiness.""

The central lie of the LGBT movement and the sexual revolution is that our sin and our desire for it are our identity—even something in which to take pride. But the good news of Christianity is that in Jesus, we can have a new identity. We need no longer be enslaved to our fallen passions. We were made for something better.

3541,4063,Confessions of a Pastor and a Note to Parishioners,"Your pastor probably will never tell you many of the things that he struggles with internally

[PHOTO: UNSPLASH/ZOLTANTASI]

I have served the same small congregation for over seven years now. I am not one of those who would consider myself to have had phenomenal success in the ministry--by most metrics. We did not grow exponentially and send out a dozen missionaries and pastors. We have grown. We have shrunk. We have grown again.

I have had discontent individuals complain over the fact that our church did not have enough elderly members, not enough programs, an unpaved parking lot, that I did not dress nicely enough, that my wife looks too young, there are too many kids, that there are not enough kids, that we sing too many old hymns, that we do not sing enough old hymns, and so on. There seems to be no shortage of illegitimate reasons why people leave a local church in which they are truly loved, pastored, and held up in prayer.

When members leave for unbiblical reasons, the faithful pastor has to fight the unsanctified tendency to envy the churches around me that appear to be more successful on account of their attendance. The faithful pastor is tempted to sometimes too quickly label other pastors as ""wolves,"" ""sellouts,"" or ""ear-itchers.""

The faithful pastor has to listen to all kinds of suggestions from people in the church about what they think would make the church grow with discernment and the consensus of the eldership without attempting everything or rejecting everything. The faithful pastor has to preach the gospel to himself regularly and remember that it is ultimately God who grows the church. As a dear friend and pastor once told me after a church split, ""Chris, God did not call you to be successful; He called you to be faithful.""

No matter the size of the church you attend, your pastor is always aware that there are bigger churches. He is assaulted and accused by the evil one, and he struggles with the balance between viewing himself as both the sinner and the child of God. He often wonders whether the church would be better off with another pastor, but loves the congregation too much to leave.

Your pastor probably will never tell you many of the things that he struggles with internally because he doesn't want to discourage you. You need to know he has thought about quitting everything and taking up a secular job. You need to know that he feels the sting of betrayal when someone leaves the church. You need to know that he weeps when the sheep bite and run away.

You need to know these things in order to know how to encourage your pastor. You cannot force people to stay, but you can keep yourself from contributing to the pastor's sorrow. These things will also make you a better servant of the Kingdom of God.

If you are a member of a church, take a good look around at the churches in your area. Talk to pastors, visit services, and focus on the major elements. Is the theology sound? Is the preaching consistent? Are they organized by scriptural principles regarding leadership, church membership, and discipline? Be critical in your search, but be expedient, and set your roots. Here are six things to keep in mind before you decide to leave a local congregation:

1. Be in the church. First, this means to actually attend services. When the doors are open, and it is possible for you to be there, be there. Secondly, it means being in the church, dedicated and emotionally attached. Are there difficult people in the church? That's a wonderful opportunity for you to treat them with the love of Christ!

Are there old hymns you do not know? Wonderful! You can examine the theology of those hymns and learn while you try to sing. Are there little children that get bored and distracted during the sermon? Great! You now have tiny souls that you are reminded to pray for and you have opportunity to encourage parents as they raise their children in the faith. Examine yourself with a flood lamp and your pastor with a candle.

2. Do not be concerned with other local churches. This goes two ways. Do not be consumed with how awful some churches in your area appear, and do not be consumed with how great other churches seem to be. While not absolutely the same, there is roughly a parallel between the relationship of the church and that of marriage. Looking around and comparing your spouse to other people you know is fatal.

One of the best lessons we can learn from Song of Solomon is the way in which the spouses are instant with songs of praise for the other. God put you in a particular church at this time and it will only be destructive to be ""browsing."" When other gospel-preaching churches are growing in your area, praise God for working in them, and return to serving the local congregation to which you have committed. Resist the urge to nurture the thought, ""Would I be happier if I were there?"" The grass only looks greener over there. You almost certainly cannot see the thorns.

3. Bloom where you are planted. God put you there to serve him, to grow, glorify His name, and be an ambassador for His kingdom. Ask not what your church can do for you, but what you can do for your church.

4. Do not idolize the ""internet pastor."" By all means, listen to the sermons of great men. Read books by gifted theologians and pastors. Find ministries that are doctrinally sound and glean from them. But remember, those men do not know you, they do not pray for you, they will not visit you when you are sick or on the brink of a divorce. Your pastor may not be as brilliant or eloquent, but a big part of it is that he is spending his time tending the flock while the theologian is reading and writing. Your pastor is aware that he is not Charles Spurgeon.

5. Do not leave lightly. After someone leaves a congregation on account of discontentment, there is a stall in the growth of the saints--especially for the pastor. Your pastor has been praying for you, preparing spiritual meals for you, and striving to serve you. Even if you leave and another person comes, he will feel the pain of your departure. Keep in mind that when a congregant leaves because of unbiblical discontentment, your pastor will be tempted to start believing that he is unfit for ministry. There is not a scriptural precedence for leaving a true church, and I am convinced that it is sin to leave for reasons other than moving, church-planting, or significant and clear biblical reasons.

6. If you do move on from a particular congregation, leave in peace. It is always a temptation for a departing person or family to try to take the best with them. This is divisiveness and sinful. Unless the church you left is a full-blown cult teaching heresy, do not poach sheep. You sin against Christ's bride by luring others away. If you are leaving for legitimate reasons, be honest with your elders about those reasons, but be tactful and brief if you must explain to others so that you do not sow seeds of discord.

I understand the appeal of reliving that church honeymoon period where everyone is nice to you and whatever work you do is thoroughly applauded. I believe Satan's most effective tactic is often to keep Christians impotent by moving them from church to church. When he does, there is perpetual delay to the work to which they once belonged. Your pastor does his best work when he is encouraged by the spiritual growth and commitment of the saints.

I pray that God presses these things upon your heart in such a way that you can best serve Him in His church. To God be the glory.

3542,4064,"Face It: People Want Hook-Ups, Sex and Perhaps a Better Love","[PHOTO:UNSPLASH/OZIELGOMEZ]

The New York Times just ran a well-written piece about hook-ups and the sexual encounters of young adults on the dating scene. The author, a young woman named Gabrielle Ulubay, shared intimate details about her recent experiences with casual sex after the first date. She was thoughtful, honest, genuine...and completely, utterly lost.

I'm ashamed to admit that for far too many years my attitude towards opinion pieces like this was less than charitable. I'd find annoyance in what I saw as poor counsel from the author and would seethe with frustration at any serious publication that helped promote it.

But truthfully, Ms. Ulubay is doing the best she can – and I wouldn't hesitate to say that's far better than I would be doing without the saving relationship I found in Christ.

Think about it. She's a graduate of a prestigious university and is being published by the New York Times. She exudes compassion, an earnestness to do the right thing herself, and help others do the same. As a hopefully maturing Christian, I find myself less inclined these days to criticize her for failing to come to the proper conclusion, and more impressed at her apparent desire to find it in the first place.

As she narrates the tempest of emotions she felt the morning after her one night stand with a companion she met on the dating app Tinder, she vulnerably expresses her concerns over being perceived as a ""slut,"" ""morally deficient,"" or ""dirty."" She acknowledges ""falling for"" her partner's flattering compliments. And Ulubay voices her persistent desire to ""have a man who wants me despite how fallible, loud or political I can be. Someone who, with a kiss, can snap me out of my self-pitying reverie.""

It doesn't take a psychologist to realize that what Ulubay wants is love. She wants real intimacy. She wants the safety of what marriage was always intended to be. And like so many, she finds herself adrift in a culture of shallow romance coupled with sexual excess. A culture that clutches its chest and sighs longingly as it watches the third make-out session on that night's episode of The Bachelor, while simultaneously relegating abstinence, virtue, and Biblical sexual morality to a bygone era.

I feel sympathy for Gabrielle Ulubay; not in a condescending way, and not because she asked for it. I feel it because I can't imagine trying to navigate the pressures of relational intimacy without a guidepost grounded in something more foundational than the wise counsel of my parents, without a compass calibrated by something more reliable than my fickle emotions. In short, I can't imagine attempting to find and express love without the living personification of love a permanent resident of my heart.

Yes, I'm talking about Jesus. And I know that's not fashionable, culturally relevant, or likely to land my opinions in the Times, but that doesn't really matter. If we're all doing the best we can, if we're all trying to piece this thing together as we go, if cultural wisdom says that no one's perspectives are any more legitimate or valid than another's, then what's the harm in expressing mine?

After all, Gabrielle writes of soliciting the advice of her friends, whose counsel included a perplexing call to ""find it within yourself."" Ulubay's exasperation at that recommendation is not unlike my own as she asks, ""How do I search within myself?"" That's just it. We're the confused ones in the first place – Gabrielle, me, you, all of us. If we're honest, that should be enough to tell us the answers don't lie within us, but without.

There's more to the Christian sexual ethic than a despotic list of don'ts. There's a holistic and healthy ideal that includes recognizing the person you are dating is someone's future spouse, and should be treated with the same dignity that we would want another treating our future spouse. There's an enduring commendation of the formation of lifelong, loving relationships built not upon tawdry lusts but self-sacrificial commitment; the recognition that love is not something we feel, but something we do.

It's God's way, and because no one knows better what will bring us lasting contentment than our own Creator, it's the better way. And I am willing to bet it's the very thing that a culture of Gabrielles are looking for.

3543,4065,Jesus' Birth Is Perhaps the Greatest Pro-Life Story Ever Told,"A blind preacher stood in line at a store, and although he could not see the ladies around him, he could hear them vocalizing their opinions about an ongoing political debate—abortion. They berated political right-wing activists who stand against abortion. They spoke hatefully about conservative Christians who assert that life begins in the womb. Together, they passionately agreed that every woman should have the right to choose what she does with her body and that abortion should be a legal option for every woman.

This godly man could remain quiet no longer. He turned to the ladies and kindly asked if he might have a word. They agreed, so the preacher offered them a biblical view regarding the pre-born child. He quoted Luke 2:5, where the Bible describes Mary as being ""great with child"" and explained that God sees the pre-born as children—not as mere tissue.

He further challenged their misconceptions, explaining that many Christians give of their time and effort to help distressed women looking for answers: ""Ladies, Christians do not hate those who abort babies, but they do believe that abortion is against God's plan. Many organizations helping women who face unwanted pregnancy are established and supported by Christians who want to show God's love to those without hope.""

As the preacher humbly concluded his thoughts, the ladies, captivated, grew quiet. Their political views had not necessarily changed, but because this man was not afraid to speak up, they had heard a Christian's beliefs poured out from a heart of compassion. As the conversation ended, the women evidenced respect for this preacher who had lovingly articulated the truth of God's Word.

Would your opinion on abortion be similar to that of these ladies? Perhaps you feel uncertain about the issue. Take a few moments to consider when life actually begins.

From eternity past, God had predetermined, according to His foreknowledge, that man would need a Savior to die for their sins (Acts 2:23). This Savior was Jesus—God who took on flesh to come to us. Jesus' predetermined death began with a predetermined birth. ""And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favor with God. And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David"" (Luke 1:30–32).

The birth of Christ was no coincidence; it was planned and appointed by God. The Old Testament contains hundreds of prophecies concerning the birth of Christ. (Micah 5:2 prophesied where Christ's birth would take place, and Daniel 9:24–26 prophesied its timing.) The probability of all these prophecies taking place exactly as recorded is inconceivable, yet they did. Only God could have orchestrated such an event.

Even before baby Jesus was born, He was living proof that God's design for life begins at conception. Scripture does not refer to the life growing inside Mary as a mere tissue. Notice how Luke 2:5 refers to Jesus when He was still in the womb of His mother: ""Mary...being great with child."" Scripture does not use the words embryo or tissue; it refers to a child.

God does not make a distinction between the pre-born and the born; both are children whom He has created. To God, the pre-born child is alive and possesses the same distinctions inherent to all humanity.

The United States Supreme Court struggles with this concept. With regard to the Roe v. Wade decision, the court made a tremendous mistake—ruling in favor of abortion—that has been a blight on our nation ever since.

The court stated, ""We need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins. When those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus, the judiciary at this point in the development of man's knowledge is not in a position to speculate as to the answer."" In other words, ""We are not equipped to answer the question concerning where life really begins. This is above our pay grade.""

There is One, and only One, who is capable of answering that question—the One who created life. Though our culture seems blind to the truths of the Bible, we must align our beliefs with God's principles and hold fast to His view of life—the view revealed in His account of Christ's divinely appointed birth.

While popular culture may consider abortion an option, it is not a biblical option. God's Word leaves no room for doubt concerning the inception of human life and the personhood of an unborn infant.

The miraculous conception of Jesus Himself is a reminder that the pre-born child is indeed a precious life given by God. Every child has been planned by God and created with a special purpose for his life. God uniquely prepares each child even while he is still in his mother's womb that he might fulfill this distinctive purpose.

In a day when the sanctity of human life is quickly eroding, Christians must lovingly and unashamedly stand for the truth. Proverbs 31:8–9 instructs us to be a voice for the oppressed who are unable to speak for themselves: ""Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction. Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.""

Surely unborn children need us to defend them and speak for them. They need us to recognize and respect the value of their life.

3544,4066,"The Deal With Health Care Sharing Regulations - How Can I Count on Other Members, Strangers?","Pixabay/DarkoStojanovic Image used for illustration purposes only.

From the earliest days of health care sharing ministries, objections to the methods of these ministries have been raised that are based on inaccuracies and misunderstandings. The following are doses of reality that bust these myths. Read more about five more myths below and catch up on the previous five myths in The Christian Post here.

Myth #6: Health care sharing ministries are not regulated.

Reality: While it is true that health care sharing ministries are not subject to state health insurance laws (because they are not health insurance), that doesn't mean HCSMs aren't subject to any laws.

HCSMs are regulated as charities in their home states under each state's charity laws and each state's attorney general, and as 501(c)3 charities by the Internal Revenue Service.

But the best regulators are HCSM members. First, for example, members of Samaritan Ministries International elect from within the membership the majority of the individuals serving on the Board that governs SMI. Also, Samaritan's Guidelines provide a complaint resolution process. Members dissatisfied with administrative decisions can appeal to a randomly chosen panel of 13 other members. That process has been invoked only four times in Samaritan's 23-year history.

Evidence points to member satisfaction through file drawers full of letters from members who like Samaritan Ministries and thank God for having provided this ministry.

Myth #7: Health insurance=health care.

Reality: While this might not necessarily be a myth about health care sharing ministries, it's closely related and a common misconception of those just learning about HCSMs.

Health insurance and health care are not synonymous. Health care is obtaining a service from a medical provider. Health insurance is contracting with a third party to pay for those services in exchange for premiums. Just because you don't have health insurance doesn't mean you don't have health care. Doctors are not required to see patients or accept their health insurance.

Being part of a health care sharing ministry allows members to bypass the third parties. They deal directly with a medical provider and directly with the HCSM. It's a bit more responsibility for members, but they are able to see the actual cost of care, thus helping them be better patients and stewards of God's provisions. One of the problems in health care today is that patients with health insurance are generally ignorant of the costs of medical care. Cash-pay patients, including those who are members of health care sharing ministries, can make better decisions about their health care because they become better informed about the process and costs.

Myth #8: People won't send money to people they don't know.

Reality: Samaritan members have been sending money to people they don't know for more than 23 years—about $25 million per month at this writing. It can be difficult for someone who doesn't believe in Christ and the Bible to understand why someone would want to send money to another person they don't know, let alone trust that a person they don't know will send money to them when they have a need. However, Christians who live according to the instructions of the Scriptures understand their responsibility to help those in need and trust that they will be treated the same in their time of need. Samaritan Ministries believes that, ultimately, God provides—often through His children.

Myth #9: Health care sharing ministries turn away people with pre-existing conditions.

Reality: Samaritan Ministries doesn't deny membership to anyone for health reasons.

Needs from pre-existing conditions aren't eligible for sharing as regular needs. However, needs related to conditions that existed before a person joined may eventually become able to be shared under certain conditions, such as an absence of symptoms for a certain number of years depending on the condition. In addition, needs related to pre-existing conditions may also be submitted as a ""Special Prayer Need."" SPNs are needs that fall outside the Guidelines (expenses related to pre-existing conditions, extensive dental work, orthodontics, etc.) but that are causing a financial burden. If approved, they are included on a month's share slips for voluntary giving above and beyond one's monthly share. In some cases, Samaritan even shares SPNs related to expenses incurred before the person's membership started.

Members of Samaritan Ministries send their money directly to each other. The only money sent to the ministry's office is an enrollment fee, a new member's first two monthly shares, and an annual membership share. Shares are only sent to households that have sent itemized medical bills to Samaritan and whose bills have been determined to be within the ministry's Guidelines.

Health care sharing is not a ""Ponzi scheme"" because there is no promise of ""returns"" to ""investors."" In fact, Samaritan goes to pains to make sure anyone interested in joining knows there's no guarantee of any kind of payment because health care sharing is not health insurance. Samaritan operates on faith, and has done so for 23 years. And the method is effective.

Neither is health care sharing a ""pyramid scheme"" because, while members are encouraged to spread the word about Samaritan, there is no requirement for them to get new members to sign up in order to be able to remain members. There is the incentive of a $100 credit for those members who are listed as referrals by new members, but telling others about Samaritan is not required.

There is also no need to recruit new members so as to ""pay off"" a backlog of needs of the old members. When needs for a month exceed available shares, Samaritan pro rates needs. And when there are not enough needs to use all the available shares, everyone can sometimes actually receive a share reduction.

Bonus myth: Health care sharing is too expensive for the average family.

Reality: The facts reveal that it is health insurance that is too expensive for the average family. According to the 2017 Milliman Medical Index, the cost of health insurance for a family of four without employer contribution is $26,944.

""Of the $26,944 spent by the MMI's family of four, $11,685 is paid by the employee, through a combination of $7,151 in payroll deductions for premium, and $4,534 in out-of-pocket costs incurred at time of care,"" the report at milliman.com (May 16, 2017) said.

""Employer-sponsored"" insurance can also be deceiving. It sounds like a bonus, as it is a tax-free benefit that companies provide to their employees, but it's really a tax break for employers that also restricts patients' freedom of health care choices. If the company's share of health care costs were given to employees in cash, tax-free or not, employees could spend it as they see fit.

By contrast, a year's worth of Samaritan Classic monthly shares for a family of four is $5,940 ($495 per month), with one month of that a membership fee. The numbers would be even less for Samaritan Basic.

That, of course, includes a $250,000 per need cap. So factoring in the program for needs over $250,000, Save to Share ($399 set aside per year for family household and less for others), with no cap per incident, would add to that. It would still, however, be much less than the cost of health insurance, whether out-of-pocket or employer-provided.

In an ever-changing health care landscape, many are researching health care sharing ministries—and for good reason. Myth often becomes a welcome reality.

""Never in our country's history has a generation been so empowered, so wealthy, so privileged—and yet so empty.""

― Ben Shapiro, Porn Generation

We live in a time of clashing worldviews. We live in a time of great corruption and uncertainty. We live in a time of great splendor, and beauty, and technological marvels and convenience. Yet suicide rates are on the rise according to the CDC suicide rates have doubled in the United States when comparing the early 2000s to the late 2000s up to 2014 (source). According to the World Happiness Report in 2007 the United States ranked 3rd in happiness in surveyed countries, and in 2016 we'd dropped to 19th (source).

There is a sense of growing corruption in our times, and of growing polarization in our culture. There are no longer shared beliefs of the past that unite all Americans in common heritage and worldview. There are now two chief warring worldviews in the United States, each of which are distinct and unique, with many varying viewpoints, but generally these two worldviews come down to the traditional vs. the progressive.

The traditional would affirm certain core philosophies held, some unknowingly, like the values leading back to ancient Greek and Roman thought, coming from people like Plato, Aristotle, and Socrates. Married with the ancient Greek philosophy of seeking unity in diversity is of course the religious heritage of Christianity in Protestant and Catholic forms, as well as various forms of Judaism. Prominent foundational thinkers of this worldview would include of course Jesus Christ, Moses, and the church fathers like Augustine, Origen, Justin Martyr, and others. Other foundational thinkers would include people like George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, John Locke (philosopher) and Martin Luther (the Reformation).

Current leaders include Victor Davis Hanson (author and speaker), Ravi Zacharias (famed Christian apologist), Mike Lee (Senator), Ted Cruz (Senator), Mark Levin (talk show host), Franklin Graham (Christian leader), David Horowitz (political philosopher), Dennis Prager (orthodox Jew and talk show host), Ben Shapiro (orthodox Jew and political commentator) and Dinesh D'Souza (Catholic apologist and film maker). Baked into these various forms of traditionalism are ideas like objective truth, natural law (God given rights), the concept of absolute truth, individual liberty, religious freedom, free market economics, the right to life, natural marriage and the fallen nature of man.

Baked into the worldview of progressivism are ideas like the basic goodness of humanity, equality, group rights, critical theory, deconstructionism, advocating for victim groups, social safety nets, welfare, socialism and democratic socialism, government redistribution of wealth, class structures, the evolutionary view of human origins, naturalism, post-modernism and viewing the course of history as a constant progression and of viewing humanity as always progressing toward the greater good.

This worldview tends to believe that a ruling elite of academics, scientists, rationalists, philosophers, political commentators and bureaucrats should rule over the society and guide the course of society, through direct democracy, and guided by the larger society's view of what progression toward utopia looks like. This worldview generally believes that very little can be learned from history, and the present must always be remade and reshaped, always evolving toward a better future.

The traditionalist view is quite different of course, believing instead that the present must be guided by the past, by history, and by learning throughout the ages. In general this worldview believes that Judaeo-Christian ethics, the ideas brought forth from the Torah and the Christian Bible form the best foundation for the ideals for a society to live by. Individual liberty is vital, religious liberty is vital, and economic liberty is very important as well. The society is considered a meritocracy where people rise and fall based on how hard they work and how well they put their ideas and values into practice.

Equality is also valued, but not in the same way as in the progressive worldview. Equality is viewed as secondary to liberty in the traditional view, while in the progressive view equality tends to be prime, while liberty is secondary to the progressive worldview.

Probably the deepest foundational difference between progressive and traditionalist is their views on the nature of man: The traditionalist recognizes man is basically sinful and fallen, with a capacity to become good if brought into religious faith and good moral practice while the progressive tends to believe that man is basically good and pure, with a capacity to do evil only on an institutional level, therefore existing institutions must be torn down and replaced with a truly equal society in which all are treated fairly.

Of course the deepest foundation of this belief is regarding the nature of the universe itself, the progressive sees a random material evolving universe in which there is no truth or absolutes and values are fungible, while the traditionalist sees an ordered universe intelligently designed by a creator, with inherent values, absolutes and objective realities.

So those are the two worldviews battling in our society. There are varying forms of course on both sides, traditionalists might be more libertarian, or more deist, or more Christian, or even atheist or gay or transgender conservatives would fall under this umbrella, additionally some would identify as paleo-conservatives, Traditionalist (with a capital T) and neo-conservative. Many progressives would consider themselves more liberal, less liberal, social justice warriors, progressives, democratic socialists, communists, blue dogs, classical liberals, atheists, naturalists, deists, liberal Christian, progressive Christian, new left, black lives matter and so on and so forth.

Now let me tell you, I understand the frustration with the polarization in our country, and in the western world overall. It's really annoying, frustrating, and mind-boggling. But I'm really sorry to tell you that's there no easy way to ""come together.""

So many complain about the polarization of the country, but we've really been coming to this point for a long time. There is a very real difficulty, seemingly insurmountable difficulty, in reconciling the traditional worldview and the progressive worldview. They are fundamentally different worldviews, with fundamentally different presuppositions. And both views can produce decent evidence for their positions. So there isn't a simple way to come together.

Though I suppose it could start with a willingness for both sides to stop with the inflated rhetoric, but I don't think we'll see that happen because it's so intense on both sides. Progressives come and out shout ""Thousands of people will die if Obamacare is repealed!"" And Conservatives are just as quick to point out ""that if the progressive agenda is allowed to continue it will mean the total collapse and destruction of western civilization itself!"" The rhetoric is wild on both sides. And the differences are not just policy-deep, they're systemic foundational beliefs.

So we see this struggle in our country between left and right. Some think both sides are pretty much the same, and there is a certain truth to that, in that there are ""establishment"" sides to both parties, that tend to be interior between the line, that are snuggled up close with special interest groups, lobbyists and the big money.

These are the sitting senators and congressmen who have been in their respective bodies for 20, 30 and even 40 years. It's a sad state of affairs, but let me assure you that returning to this supposed bi-partisan middle ground is not the answer either. It was this establishment middle ground that brought us to the point of 20+ trillion dollars in debt, hyper-inflation, career politicians, and Washington becoming a place that was seemingly cut off from the will of the people.

Politics is politics. I don't have a further comment on all this progressive vs. traditionalist struggle. Obviously I would fall more on the traditionalist side of the struggle. But my concern is the state of human souls. My concern is helping people to understand what the meaning of life is, and how to connect with what is beyond us. And I do believe there is a way forward.

Ultimately it will have to start with me. And with you. We look to solving the problems of the world by changing things around us, but what about us? It has to start with us, internally, and how we live externally.

We've often been a people of hedonism. We've been indulgent and lazy, staring at the television when we should've been pursuing holiness. We've prostituted ourselves to one night stands when we should've been mighty men and women of God, standing boldly, with great dignity and honor against the rising tide of darkness. We should've been building up the future generations, not destroying them, lying to them and educating them into imbecility. We've made many mistakes, and to better the world we must better ourselves.

But there is still hope. We can patch up these wounds, and cry out to God almighty for His help and deliverance, and come to a humility, and a patient knowledgeable about who we are and what we need. The truth is there is only one who can truly transform our souls into new people, it's God. But of course the question must come up and many would ask, ""Why do you believe in God?""

It's a fair question and a good question. Most assume that Christians are backwards fundamentalists who have faith in things that are not true and are simply practicing a sort of cultural faith based on their heritage. If that were the sum of it, I would not be here now talking about it, because if that's all it is, then it's nothing, and it's less than nothing, it's just an empty pattern of nothingness.

Thankfully that's not what I believe. I believe in a reasonable, intelligent faith based on history, science, personal experience, textual criticism, and philosophy. And I believe facts in these disciplines indicate that God does exist. Christianity is unique as a world religion in that there is a great deal of historical and archaeological evidence for the facts depicted in the biblical documents.

So my response regarding the existence of God is this: I think it's very reasonable to believe in God. Let me tell you why:

1. The universe exists and it must have a cause, everything that begins to exist has a cause. The universe began to exist. Evolution can't create, neither can science. The universe needs a first cause that is timeless, outside the system and infinitely powerful. God is the logical first cause (cosmological argument)

2. The universe is finely tuned, there is order in the universe at work that allows for planets, stars and galaxies. There are laws in the universe, constants like gravity, relativity, and so on. It's reasonable that when we find mathematical laws and cosmological laws in the universe, that there is a powerful being that created those systems (argument from design)

3. Within the human cell we find massive amounts of information. When we look at the human eye, we see a system so incredibly complicated that it could never come about by chance. When scientists look into the human body they see a complex yet harmonious system of machinery. We see cells and tissue, and DNA and systems that all function as one, and are irreducibly complex. (specified complexity, irreducibly complexity).

4. The human mind intuitively knows that there is good and evil, right and wrong, good and bad. Objective moral laws exist, they are universal. If objective morals exist, then an objective moral law giver must exist, therefore God exists. (moral argument)

Those are four key logical progressions that indicate it's reasonable to believe God is real. We can also talk about the historical authenticity of the biblical documents, how there are thousands of manuscripts that match each other highly accurately.

And we can also talk about how Jesus Christ is mentioned in historical documents outside the Bible, such as in the histories of Tacitus and Josephus, indicating that Jesus Christ did really exist and his life was recorded. There is a great deal of evidence, and I think you'll see if you really research it, that Jesus is truly who He said He was and is, today alive and active in the world.

So we move beyond these key arguments for the existence of God. But for the believer reading these words, do memorize these facts and be prepared to provide an answer to those you may an encounter who don't know Jesus.

We should know the truth. And people in our world don't trust the word of God. We can show how science and history point to Christ. Many will not be interested in the truth anyway, just finding a way to avoid and reject the concept of a creator, but there are many out there who have genuine questions and are honestly searching for the truth. Give them answers.

We've often struggled as the church on Earth to contend with the forces of culture and change. Don't get me wrong, the church has done so much good in human history and does a great deal of good today. Please don't mistake me on that. But many of us have struggled to step out and take action, and meet people with the gospel.

We've sat idle in our citadels as the darkness closed in from every side. We've trembled and quaked at the thought that we might offend someone or we might get called judgmental. We've grown apathetic and exhausted self-pleasuring. Wve slept and stared at the television and the iphone while the moral structure of our society disintegrated.

We've been so afraid, so dossil, so set in our ways, so anachronistic that nothing seemed capable to move us, and our army disappeared around us, and all that was left was old women and young boys. We've left our responsibility to hold the line against the night, in line with the Spirit, and philosophical and moral chaos has resulted. We've allowed our religion to become a hellfire, a lie, and empty, and done little to remedy this.

But not all of us. Some of us continue to fight. Some of us like ""strider"" on the plains, remains as a sentinel, a sentry, lone patrol-men in the wilderness, without an army, but still jaunting through the night, fighting and ambushing enemy troops moving through our regions, sleeping on rocks and eating locusts and wild honey, dogged in our determination and unfailing in our hope. In the cold wind and moon-lit night we look up at the sky filled with stars and wonder if there is a future left. And when we sleep we dream of far away places, and see things yet to come, and something in those images heals us within. At one moment we fear and tremble, at the next we are filled with zeal and boldness, resolute to never give up the fight, to never stop trying, to stand for Christ to the very last battle. This is the struggle for the Christian soldier in the post-truth culture in which we live.

We stand, we fear, we fight, we struggle, we see the glory of God, yet we live in the angst of a fallen society. We're like Lot in the Sodom, sad in our hearts for the collapse. And we never give up. This is our lost cause. And more so, the cause of all mankind. In the world of darkness, a bright light has shined, and we now bear that sacred fire in our souls. We are the lightbringers, through Him who gives us strength. We are the keepers of the sacred fire, and the ones through whom Christ makes his appeal to the world.

This is my call to you Christians standing in these late hours: Stand firm, do not be moved. Don't give up, and don't lose heart. Don't lose heart in the face of sin, and darkness, and sin celebration, and even brokenness, abortion, broken families, child abuse, the mass marketing of lies, the corruption in the high places and all the rest. Do not lose heart. You must not.

Guard your heart, and turn the eyes of your heart to Christ. As it says in Hebrews Chapter 12: ""Since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles. And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us, 2 fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. 3 Consider him who endured such opposition from sinners, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.""

Consider what Jesus had to deal with. Are we so special in our time? Did modernism really herald a new age of goodness? Of course not. Very little has in fact changed. When Jesus spoke to the people, the crowds were divided, many believed him, many did not believe him and apposed him. That's how it always goes. Our time is no different. Though it is sad to see a nation that once honored God, began to mock, ignore, and reject the very concept of God. That tragedy should not be overlooked, and to mourn for a night is no sin.

Everything is about Jesus, all of life is about Jesus, and the word itself is Jesus. That is the hardest thing. It's the almost impossible thing. It's the scariest thing because it's so unknown. It's so terrifying because it means giving up our own control. It's like a haunting specter, it's seems beyond us to do, not because we can't choose it, but because it's a new world that might leave us in last place.

That hardest thing is this: Really giving up our entire, whole life to Christ. And instead of us being in control of everything, we willingly yield our heart, life, plans, future, decisions, and even the things we love most dearly, to God almighty, and we admit, yes God is God, and I am not, and I give authority over to God. We yield our own authority to Him. Why? Because we can know, and know that the best life we can possibly live, not the easiest or the most pleasurable, but the most pure, right and best life course can only be found in Christ. We trust Christ for that. And we yield our destiny to Him.

We yield our future to him and our present day, yet we also yield our past to Him. We yield our past wrongs to him, we yield our sins to him, we yield every guilt to him, and we yield every painful memory, every anxiety, depression, youthful sorrow, lost love, broken childhood sorrows, all our brokenness, all our sins, all our wrongs, all our selfishness, all our self-seeking, all our evil desires, and our good desires, and every big thing and little thing, we yield to Him, and we are transformed fundamentally into a new person.

New life. We become a new person. I've experienced it myself. The new life is real. It's very, very real. As I see myself being changed internally, slowly but surely, I wonder at the possibilities, and I really wonder about the nature of reality itself.

We've been sold such a lie as young people in this day and age. We've been sold the lie that life has no meaning. Nothing could be further from the truth. It's a disgusting, ugly lie that entices us to live duplicitous, selfish lives of cynicism, indulgence and erotomania. It's sad, and pathetic, and it's left us chained to a hundred addictions, opening up desires in our hearts that nothing can ever fulfill. And we're exhausted by it all. We can't stand it and we found nothing in those bottles, pills, parties and sexual encounters except suicide and self-hatred.

So in the new life I wonder at my destiny: What is this future God has designed? What have I been chosen for? And I see in the future a perfect reality beyond the chaos and darkness of this world. I see a redeemed humanity living in a timeless state, on a perfected Earth, reset, redesigned and recrafted to a perfect city, a perfect nature, a perfect animal kingdom and a perfect humanity, perfected by Christ, and given great position and authority by Him who made the human soul. To know God is a lifelong process, this is not a once and done deal. To come to comprehend the glory of God is a lifelong process of seeking after God, and seeing God respond to your seeking. That is the truth of it.

If you've been hurt by religious people in the past, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, and I apologize on their behalf for what they did. We're suppose to represent Christ in this world as Christians and quite often we fail at that. I know I've personally failed at that time and again. But ultimately we can't look to Christ-followers for perfection, the whole point of Christianity is acknowledging our own sinfulness, our own shortcomings, selfishness, and turning to Christ for salvation and new life. We're between worlds right now, so Christians will always fail you. But Christ will never fail you, if you seek after Him.

If you don't know Him, then know Him. If you do know Him, then be a true Spirit filled born again follower of Jesus Christ. Be set on fire for Christ. Be excited for this mission. God has called you, in His will to a certain calling for your life. He will reveal it to you, and if He has, do walk in it, and do love it dearly. Love it with all your heart and do your very best at it. Be wise, and know His word clearly. Study it again and again. Be one of those rare Christians that truly brings the presence of God with you wherever you go. We see desperately need that sort of strong Spirit-filled Christianity today. There is so much compromise today, there is so much wishy-washyness in the church, and people are afraid to take a clear stance on difficult issues. Be bold, brave, and fearless. The people of this world desperately need you to be 100% all in for Jesus. Everything is at stake, everyday. Really live out the entailments of this Christian faith, recognize the ticking clock, the state of reality, and the future that is being offered to the human race. This is all real. That is the fundamental flaw of our modern Christianity, we've lived it out like it's a nice thing to talk about, when it's a true reality that should break through into every moment of our lives and completely transform how we see the world. And it will, if we'll just believe and realize how real and present it truly is.

Yes, life has meaning, yes, truth is knowable, yes, Christ is real, yes, the new world will come. It's all true. It's all real. And it was a shock to my entire world when I really realized that. I know it seems like there is little hope for our world. I know it seems like the darkness is too strong, and we are too weak. But those are just the sort of moments when God moves in and takes action to transform the world, when we know without a doubt that it must've been Him because we weren't strong enough to really make a difference. I don't really care about your politics, right, left, center, people can disagree and still love one another, what matters to me is your soul, and your eternal future. There is a God. He has designed the universe, this planet, the plants, animals, and the DNA strands in our body, and He will respond when you seek Him out. That is the craziest, most world shaking thing, when you seek out God and you realize for a moment as you sit alone in your room, that He's actually, really responding to your seeking. Now that will bring down the house of cards, let me tell you. It's true. Good luck, and God bless.

3546,4068,A Challenge for Never Trumpers: Are You Willing to Be Honest?,"During the Republican primaries, I was nearly a Never Trumper, so I'm quite sympathetic to that mindset. But I have a challenge for all of you who still identify as Never Trumpers: Are you willing to be as honest about the accomplishments of President Trump as you are about his failings?

For many of you who could not vote for Trump, it was a matter of conscience. How could you be a ""values voter"" and yet vote for a man with such abysmal moral values, a thrice-married, playboy, billionaire?

Put another way, your integrity compelled you to be a Never Trumper. But does your integrity now compel you to admit where he has done well? Where he has kept his promises? Where he has championed causes that really matter to ""value voters""? Where he has stood strong for the some of the great moral issues of the day?

Lest you think I'm being one-sided in my challenge to Never Trumpers, in June I wrote an article titled, ""Don't Sell Your Soul Defending the Words of President Trump."" And earlier this month I penned, ""As Evangelicals Our Ultimate Allegiance is to the Lord, Not the President,"" just to give two examples.

In short, I concur with prominent Never Trumper David French, who just last month counseled his colleagues to follow these guidelines: ""Praise him when he's right, critique him when he's wrong, apply the same standards to your own side that you apply to ideological opponents, and keep your eyes fixed on the larger, more important cultural trends.""

But have Never Trumpers done this? On a regular basis, those of us who voted for Trump are called on to repudiate his latest ill-advised comment or tweet, or to condemn a past indiscretion. And with words similar to French's, I recently wrote, ""When the president does the right thing, we commend him and encourage him. When he does the wrong thing, with full respect for his office, we express our differences. Is this really so hard?""

But I ask again, have you done this as Never Trumpers? Doesn't your integrity compel you to be even-handed, or, perhaps, to acknowledge where, at times, you may have been wrong?

Since the media bombards us 24/7 with the latest failings or alleged failings of the President, there's no need for me to rehearse them here. Only the most extreme pro-Trumpers view him as a flawless saint.

But will you, my Never Trumper friends, be as truthful in your praise as you have been in your criticism?

Consider the President's pro-life words and actions.

He appointed Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, along with a score of fine justices for other federal positions. This alone is highly significant.

Last week, ""The Department of Justice (DOJ) filed an amicus (or 'friend-of-the-court') brief at the Supreme Court Wednesday, urging the justices to overturn a California law requiring pro-life crisis pregnancy centers to post information about state-funded abortions."" Could anything be more anti-Obama than this?

Also last week, Trump made history as the first sitting president to address the March for Life in DC, which begs the question, Why didn't our previous, pro-life presidents do this? And in his speech, he criticized Roe v. Wade by name.

In terms of actions taken so far, was Vice President Pence exaggerating when he called Trump the ""most pro-life"" president in our history? Pence ""boasted of a litany of anti-abortion measures by the Trump administration over its first year: Banning federal funds for global health groups that promote abortion under the 'Mexico City policy,' defunding the United Nations Population Fund, and overturning an Obama administration rule that required states to provide funding for Planned Parenthood.""

How about Trump's actions opposing LGBT activism and standing for religious freedoms?

For the first time in 8 years, last June was not gay pride month. In contrast, January 16 was just proclaimed ""Religious Freedom Day.""

Evaluating Trump's first year in office, a headline on The Hill announces, ""Trump administration amasses striking anti-LGBT record in first year."" Similarly, a headline on The Conversation describes 2017 as ""the year of transgender moral panic.""

To give one case in point, The Hill reported last October that, ""Attorney General Jeff Sessions is reversing course on the Justice Department's policy that a 1964 civil rights law protects transgender individuals from discrimination.""

And in stark contrast with the Obama administration's aggressive pushing of transgender activism in our children's schools, the DOJ under Trump has reversed course here as well. This too is quite major. (It does not bring me joy that transgenders and their allies feel threatened or insecure; it does bring me joy that sanity is prevailing in our schools.)

Trump is also the first president to take a major step in repealing the onerous Johnson Amendment, although more still needs to be done to make this far-reaching and permanent.

And what of Trump's decision to move our embassy to Jerusalem, along with his calling out of the Palestinian Authority's deception?

For many conservative voters, these are some of the most important issues: the sanctity of life and marriage; preserving religious freedoms; standing with Israel.

And what of the strength of the economy? The decimation of ISIS?

Do you have the integrity to commend the President for the good he has done?

Steve Deace says it well: ""I was once NeverTrump. I have called our current president both a narcissist and a child. Compared him to both Peter Pan and former pro wrestling manager extraordinaire Bobby 'The Brain' Heenan.

""But...

""The news that the Trump administration is setting up a new division within the Department of Health and Human Services to protect the conscience rights of doctors, nurses, and other health-care providers is unambiguously good. It allows HHS to come to the defense of conscientious objectors working in the health-care field by defending the God-given rights of those who opt out of 'certain procedures' — like the killing field that is abortion or gender-bending sex-change operations.""

This ""is an outcome that simply wouldn't and couldn't have happened if Hillary Clinton was president,"" nor Deace reasons, likely would have happened under an establishment candidate like Mitt Romney.

So, once more, my appeal to the Never Trumpers: Will you demonstrate your integrity by recognizing the good President Trump has done without overbalancing your statement with a litany of the negatives, at least just this one time? And might you even acknowledge that, in some important ways, he has done better than you expected?

I look forward to hearing your responses.

3547,4069,Dysfunction In the Government: How Should Believers React to the Shutdown?,"(Photo: Reuters/Jason Reed)

As I write, we are in a government shutdown. The blame game is fully in play. In very black and white terms, each political party is saying all the blame belongs on the other side. As in much of our current political discourse, presentation is made in an either/or, all/nothing sense. How should believers think about this situation? What would a third way say?

Usually in a dysfunctional relationship, and our government is dysfunctional these days, it takes two to make the dysfunction. Now what we run to next, even when we acknowledge this, is to ask who bears the brunt of the blame. But does that really help us get out of the dysfunction? When do we take the view that we are called to own our own junk? Whatever the other has done wrong, what I can control is what I may be doing wrong that is contributing to the breakdown. Maybe what is wrong here is that each side is focused only on what it wants. So why not wrestle with an alternative way to address our current situation, a third way?

So where are we? One side is saying we need to fund the government. True enough. The other side is saying but funding the government one month at a time with piecemeal proposals, which we have been doing now for months, is no way to budget a great nation. What is wrong about that? Where is the black and white in that discussion? Who has it most right or wrong? Does that really help us? A solution is to get out of our black and white approach to issues to see the spectrum and discuss the relationship between the parts.

The sticking point in the current stalemate is the debate over DACA, the dreamers. Once again there is a black and white conflict as we discuss it: illegal immigration versus a sense of justice about children who have grown up here whose illegal presence was through no fault of their own but that of their parents, something our previous protection of them recognized. Even more amazing is that each side says DACA should be fixed and protections should be provided. As the old Nike ad says, then why not just do it?

What is in the way are different, one dimensional answers for how we should approach the solution to that particular problem that has depth and is not one dimensional. Again we have a black and white discussion: the law needs to be followed with crucial concerns about security versus should we honor our sense of justice about these children who have been here much of their lives? Who wants to make that choice as an either/or? Both are worthy considerations.

Perhaps we should ask, what should be the relationship between these two worthy goals. Maybe we should ask what the spectrum of options might be for trying to be sensitive to both concerns. Maybe we should wrestle with how to craft laws that seek to balance two sets of legitimate concerns. Maybe we should ""come let us reason together"". The third way of the church would be concerned with the human dimensions on all sides of this question. It would recognize a spectrum and ask how to balance two sets of legitimate concerns. We have the right to change how our laws work and craft better ones that work. It would ask how we can craft something that balances these concerns.

As concerned citizens, rather than allowing each party to grab one concern and pit it against the other, we should insist and look for people to govern who get this alternative way of doing legislation. We should look for people who see the spectrum and ask about how competing themes relate to each other. There will still be differences and debates for sure, but there also will be more options to consider than the ones that lead us into a government shutdown. Maybe the third way asks us to more interested in how we can live better together than who is most to blame.

3571,4097,"The Decision of Roe v. Wade Killed 60 Million Babies, Can One Ministry Make Difference?","In the decade after Roe v. Wade was decided, nearly 60 million abortions were performed in the U.S. That's more than all abortions in the previous two centuries combined. Dr. Jack Graham is taking the charge to fight the odds.

(Screenshot: March for Life) Tens of thousands of people gather at the National Mall in Washington, D.C., for the 45th Annual March for Life, Jan. 19, 2018.

It all started with a sermon. At the time, I was a 30-something-year-old pastor leading a congregation in South Florida and caring for a young family.

About 10 years earlier, a woman in Texas had filed suit in the state's northern district court to obtain an abortion, back then an illegal procedure unless necessary to save the mother's life. Her name was Norma McCorvey, but she used the alias ""Jane Roe"" in court. Her case would culminate in one of the most fateful Supreme Court decisions of the 20th century, legalizing abortion in all 50 states.

In the decade after Roe v. Wade was decided, nearly 60 million abortions were performed in the U.S. That's more than all abortions in the previous two centuries combined.

As a Christian, I knew with every fiber of my being that abortion was an affront against God, who places infinite value on every human life. And my faith compelled me to speak for the millions who couldn't speak for themselves. It was on one of these occasions, during a sermon on the devastating consequences of abortion, that I felt God speak to me. He asked, ""What are you going to do about it?""

We began a pregnancy center at First Baptist Church West Palm Beach. And when I accepted the call to lead Prestonwood Baptist Church in Dallas, Texas in 1989, I knew this ""Jesus Ministry"" was one we had to duplicate, and take a proactive stand for the life of the unborn. In 1991 we launched Prestonwood Pregnancy Center, a clinic to reach women at their point of need during unplanned pregnancies.

Today, our center provides counseling, education and medical services — such as pregnancy tests and sonograms — free of charge to thousands of women and families. Throughout the years, we have served various locations in the Dallas area with mobile sonogram units, making it convenient for women to drop in for a prompt and confidential visit.

In the past 26 years, our staff, along with a wonderful group of volunteers who have a heart for this ministry, have served more than 70,000 clients, from single, pregnant women uncertain about their future to unsuspecting fathers to married couples who are in a difficult stage in life.

But here's the best part: we've seen over 42,500 women choose life for their babies! In fact, 9 out of 10 women who visited our center in 2017 chose to keep their babies.

Over the years, one of the things we've learned is that we've sometimes given Roe v. Wade way too much agency. It's true, the case made abortion legal in the U.S., allowing for the killing of untold millions of babies, but the law doesn't actually force anyone to get an abortion. In our experience, most women don't really want to end their pregnancy. Oftentimes, it's economic and social pressures, and the lack of support from family and a community system, that drive expecting mothers to prematurely end their pregnancies.

A recent study on the emotional effects of abortion confirms the heavy influence of outside pressures on women hesitating to carry their pregnancy to term. The study, which surveyed 987 post-abortion patients, found that 58 percent of the women had gotten an abortion to make someone else happy. In a more telling statistic, 7 out of 10 disagreed that their decision ""was entirely free from even subtle pressure from others to abort.""

But here's the figure that broke my heart: 2 in 3 said, ""They knew in their hearts that they were making a mistake when they underwent the abortion.""

For the past four and a half decades, the pro-life movement has fought tooth and nail for the right to life of the unborn. We want America to wake up and realize that abortion from whichever perspective you look at it — morally, ethically and, yes, we believe even legally — is wrong. And we'll do anything in our power to see the day when no more babies are aborted in America. But we cannot get lost in a war of words and forget where the battle is actually fought. If we care about the babies, we need to start caring for the mothers.

Compared to America's mammoth abortion machine, our pregnancy center seems like putting a Band-Aid on an gushing wound. But I've always noted that the famous saying ""It's better to light a candle than curse the darkness"" is apropos in this battle. I can't help but think what would happen if every woman pressed to get an abortion had access to the support and resources of a center like ours. Abortion might remain legal, but fewer women would turn to it as a solution.

For us, fighting abortion means investing our resources to help as many women and their babies as possible. Praise God, we've saved 42,500 lives so far ... and we're still counting.

3572,4098,The Two Ways We Should Fear God,"(PHOTO: PIXABAY)

We need to make some important distinctions about the biblical meaning of ""fearing"" God. These distinctions can be helpful, but they can also be a little dangerous. When Luther struggled with that, he made this distinction, which has since become somewhat famous: He distinguished between what he called a servile fear and a filial fear.

The servile fear is a kind of fear that a prisoner in a torture chamber has for his tormentor, the jailer, or the executioner. It's that kind of dreadful anxiety in which someone is frightened by the clear and present danger that is represented by another person. Or it's the kind of fear that a slave would have at the hands of a malicious master who would come with the whip and torment the slave. Servile refers to a posture of servitude toward a malevolent owner.

Luther distinguished between that and what he called filial fear, drawing from the Latin concept from which we get the idea of family. It refers to the fear that a child has for his father. In this regard, Luther is thinking of a child who has tremendous respect and love for his father or mother and who dearly wants to please them. He has a fear or an anxiety of offending the one he loves, not because he's afraid of torture or even of punishment, but rather because he's afraid of displeasing the one who is, in that child's world, the source of security and love.

I think this distinction is helpful because the basic meaning of fearing the Lord that we read about in Deuteronomy is also in the Wisdom Literature, where we're told that ""the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom."" The focus here is on a sense of awe and respect for the majesty of God. That's often lacking in contemporary evangelical Christianity. We get very flippant and cavalier with God, as if we had a casual relationship with the Father. We are invited to call Him Abba, Father, and to have the personal intimacy promised to us, but still we're not to be flippant with God. We're always to maintain a healthy respect and adoration for Him.

One last point: If we really have a healthy adoration for God, we still should have an element of the knowledge that God can be frightening. ""It is a frightening thing to fall into the hands of the living God"" (Heb. 10:31). As sinful people, we have every reason to fear God's judgment; it is part of our motivation to be reconciled with God.

3573,4099,Is the Shroud of Turin Evidence of Jesus' Existence?,"Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus' body, and Pilate ordered that it be given to him. Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away."" (Matthew 27:58-60)

The Shroud of Turin is an ancient, sepia-colored, rectangular, 14.3 x 3.7 foot linen cloth woven in a three-to-one herringbone twill composed of flax fibrils with the front and the back image of a naked man with his hands folded across his groin on it. It is considered to be the linen cloth the dead Jesus was wrapped in after He was crucified. Some have concluded it is the true burial shroud of Jesus. Others have pronounced it a medieval forgery. In my opinion, the evidence completely disproves it being a medieval forgery...

1. A set of tests conducted on the Shroud place the cloth to the time ranging from 300 B.C. to 400 A.D., well within the time of Jesus of Nazareth (Stanglin, USA Today, 2013).

2. The bloodstains, as forensic scientists and chemists now know, were created by real blood, specificallyblood of a torture victim. In addition to that, an x-ray-taken showed excess iron in blood areas, as expected for blood. Microchemical tests for proteins were positive in blood areas but not in any other parts of the Shroud. Furthermore, claims are that the blood has been confirmed as authentic hemoglobin and identified as Type AB!

3. Microscopic traces of the flowers, and pollen, has been found throughout the Turin Shroud. Out of hundreds of flowers on the Shroud,twenty-eight of them grow in Israel. Twenty grow in Jerusalem itself, and the other eight grow potentially within the close vicinity of Jerusalem (Whanger and Whanger, Duke.edu, 2015). Of these twenty-eight plants, twenty-seven of the identified plants are in bloom in March and April.

Jesus was crucified in Jerusalem during the Passover in the Spring of c. 30 AD. (Matthew 26:12; Mark 14:1; Luke 22:1,7: John 18:28) Half of the floral images and pollen grains from the plants are found only in the Middle East or other similar areas but never in Europe, the favored location of the forgery of the Shroud. Most of the flowers were clustered around the head and chest of the man on the Shroud - consistent with Jewish burial custom in Jesus' time.The pollen also dates to the first-century, further indication that the Shroud was first found in first-century Israel. In addition, many grains of the pollen, Gundelia tournefortii, have been identified. This particular pollen has large thorns, blooms in Israel between March and May, and most of the grains of this pollen have been recovered near the man's shoulder! Could it have been the crown of thorns (Matthew 27:29)?

""In addition to being unable to explain so many things about the Shroud of Turin, did it ever occur to modern skeptics that no medieval forger would have been able to forge pollen grains and floral images. Pollen grains are able to be seen only through a microscope. A medieval artist/forger did not even KNOW about individual GRAINS of pollen, could never ever have seen a microscopic grain of pollen—until the 1800's AD.""—Sandra Sweeny Silver

4. The image is not a stain, it is not painted on the Shroud, nor is it burned on. Instead, it is seared on to the cloth with a technology that has yet to be explained. Scientists can't even reproduce it with modern technology, let alone medieval technology! Nothing existed in medieval or ancient times that could produce such an X-ray as this. The only explanation would be some sort of large burst of radiation, that was emitted as Jesus was resurrected from the dead, creating the image on the cloth. The process causing the yellowness of the top most fibers of the threads responsible for the image is also unknown.

Italian scientist Paolo DiLazzaro tried for five years to replicate the image and concluded that it was produced by ultraviolet light, but the ultraviolet light necessary to reproduce the image ""exceeds the maximum power released by all ultraviolet light sources available today."" The time for such a burst ""would be shorter than one forty-billionth of a second, and the intensity of the ultra violet light would have to be around several billion watts.""

5. The image of the man on the Shroud can be read by 3D imaging technology, something that paintings can't do. The image on the Shroud is also only a few fibers deep. The image on the Shroud is not a painting, and that's a fact!

6. The type of cloth is consistent with fabrics from first-century Israel, but not with medieval Europe. A forger would have had to not only forge the image, but would have had to have detailed knowledge of linen weaves of the first century and then not only reproduce it, but age it convincingly.

7. Usually, whenever there's a picture depicting the crucifixion of Jesus, it shows the nail prints in the palms of the hand. However, modern science has shown that a nail through the middle of the palm of a man's hand would not be sufficient to hold most of the weight of a man on a cross. The nail would tear through the hand. The placement of the nails in crucifixion was most likely in the wrist.

The Turin Shroud shows the nail marks at the lower part of the hand into the wrist, just as expected! Also, experiments conducted on cadavers note that the Turin Shroud accurately depicts how crucifixions would have transpired. In addition, the whip markings on the man's back match the ends of the flagrums used by the first-century Romans for scourgings, his body shows signs of rigor mortis in a crucified position, some of his blood flows are post mortem, and it even shows marks indicating a spear wound - consistent with John 19:34. It matches the details of Jesus' crucifixion accurately!

The evidence seems highly probable that the Turin Shroud is genuinely the cloth that covered Jesus of Nazareth before His amazing resurrection from the dead. However, we do not need to rely solely on the Shroud of Turin to provide evidence for the resurrection of Jesus, since the evidence from both Christian and non-Christian sources alone are enough to verify the reliability of the crucifixion and resurrection account. See: Historical Evidence For Jesus' Resurrection.

Christian Evidence was created to enable Christians to defend their faith, and to open their eyes up to the overwhelming evidence for Christianity. We hope to answer many common questions people have regarding Christianity, as well as displaying the overwhelming evidence for creation, evidence against evolution, the amazing end time prophecies that have unfolded before our eyes, and the incredible proofs of God.

3574,4100,Tiffany Trump's Friends Enter a New Kind of Marriage,"Quentin Esme Brown is a well-known socialite, formerly from New York City but now living in Los Angeles. Peter Cary Peterson was once featured in a show about wealthy teenagers living in Manhattan. The two have been close friends since they were kids.

Last weekend, they were married in Las Vegas. The event made national headlines because Tiffany Trump was a flower girl. Is this a case of two friends who fell in love and got married out of romantic passion? Not at all.

Yahoo reported: ""Tiffany Trump's friends just entered a sexless marriage, which isn't a terrible idea."" Esme called her marriage ""unconventional"" and explained: ""Peter and I are not romantically involved–in fact we are still dating others and will continue to seek love in all its forms–we are just each other's hearts and wish to begin our journey towards evolution, because the more we face reality, the more we can see that there is no right or wrong.""

A licensed therapist affirmed their decision: ""We don't need to get married for any of the reasons we used to. Once you've got everything else in place, it is like the cherry on top."" Another psychologist explained: ""A lot of these sorts of marriages are in response to society getting increasingly isolated, and people want to create a kinship model.""

Brown's response to her wedding is the mantra of our age: ""We have one life. Free yourself!""

""Keep moving forward with God's strength and guidance""

God created marriage as a covenant between a man and a woman built on unconditional love (Genesis 2:18-24; Ephesians 5:21-33). When he gave the first man and woman to each other, he told them to ""be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth"" (Genesis 1:28). However, our culture's definition of marriage has obviously departed drastically from God's design in recent years.

Prior to Roe v. Wade, unborn children were protected by law; Americans now abort more than 650,000 babies each year. We once valued the sanctity of life until natural death; today, 73 percent of Americans support legalized euthanasia. This percentage has more than doubled since 1951.

The news is not all negative by any means. As Janet Denison noted in her latest blog, Christians can still influence society in significant ways. The continuing response to Target's dressing room policy illustrates the power of Christians who coalesce around a moral issue. The popularity of Chick-fil-A and Hobby Lobby show that companies can take strong Christian stands in our culture.

But as Janet noted, there is also much work to be done, so we must ""keep moving forward with God's strength and guidance.""

To that end, consider a biblical event that serves as a parable for cultural engagement today.

A brick in one hand and a sword in the other

Nehemiah 4 finds the people of Israel at work rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem. In a day without national armies or police forces, a city's walls were essential to its security. Without such walls, Jerusalem could not be repopulated.

However, the project faced enormous opposition from Israel's enemies who understood the strategic significance of this construction project. As a result, half of the people worked on the wall, while half ""held the spears, shields, bows, and coats of mail"" (v. 16). In addition, ""Those who carried burdens were loaded in such a way that each labored on the work with one hand and held his weapon with the other"" (v. 17).

This metaphor seems powerful to me: rebuilding the nation with a brick in one hand and a sword in the other. We are to work for the best while preparing for the worst.

If you're traveling by air and worried about the flu, you should pray for God's protection. But you should also clean common surfaces on the airplane and avoid crowds wherever you can.

If you're a parent, you should pray for your children to be protected from the devastation of pornography. But you should also use resources such as Covenant Eyes to provide real-time accountability and other support.

If you're concerned about the moral direction of our culture, you should pray for spiritual awakening each day. But you should also look for ways to impact the lives you touch today.

""He did what he could""

On Wednesday, a drone flew to two distressed swimmers off the coast of Australia and dropped a self-inflating rescue pod into the water, saving their lives. Scientists have now developed a blood test that can detect early signs of eight kinds of cancer. But neither the drone nor the blood test can help people unless they are taken to those who need them.

A brick in one hand and a sword in the other is an image for rebuilding the spiritual walls of our culture. We should be positive and proactive in sharing God's love with our world (Matthew 22:39). But we should also be ready to ""contend for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints"" (Jude 3).

Know that God has given you all you need to fulfill your Kingdom assignment. Your brick is the right size for the wall you are called to build. Your sword is sharp enough for the battle you are called to wage. In Bread for the Journey, Henri Nouwen notes: ""We are good enough to do what we are called to do.""

Dwight Moody said, ""If I could go down to my grave and have it honestly written above it, 'He did what he could,' I would rather have it than a monument of gold reaching to heaven."" Do you agree?

4199,4761,The Cathedral You Wouldn't Expect to Find in Hawaii,"Hawaii is synonymous with sun and sand, mai tai cocktails, the singer Don Ho and, of course, Polynesian culture.

(PHOTO: DENNIS LENNOX)

For many, Hawaii is synonymous with sun and sand, mai tai cocktails, the singer Don Ho and of course, Polynesian culture.

But not far from Honolulu's famous Waikiki Beach are visible reminders of a different time, when Hawaii was a sovereign country ruled by a monarch.

One such reminder is the Cathedral Church of St. Andrew, located about 15 minutes from Waikiki and within walking distance of the 1960s-era state capitol and other historic buildings from before the Stars and Stripes starting flying over the Hawaiian islands.

Today St. Andrew's is the seat of the Episcopal bishop of Hawaii, but it actually dates to late 1860s when Hawaii's monarchs, King Kamehameha IV and Queen Emma, were closely aligned with the British under Queen Victoria.

As a result, the Anglicanism of the Church of England — not the Episcopal Church — became the state church, known as the Church of Hawaii. Hawaii wouldn't come under the jurisdiction of American Episcopalians until after the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy in 1893.

Expand | Collapse (PHOTO: DENNIS LENNOX)

Designed by London architects William Slater and R. H. Carpenter, it is inspired by the style of 12th century French Gothic. And while the architecture is interesting and well executed, the cathedral is a notable example of prefabricated construction — its stained glass windows, pointed arches and columns were sent piece-by-piece in ships for assembly in Honolulu. This was quite the logistical and architectural feat, as the Panama Canal wouldn't open until 1914.

While Kamehameha IV's heir, Kamehameha V, laid the cornerstone in 1867 the first services weren't held until Christmas Day 1886, when the quire and part of the nave were ready. Construction continued until 1958, when the six-bay nave, narthex, vestibule and the west front with its magnificent floor-to-ceiling stained glass window were finished.

Inside, the church is furnished fairly typical of Gothic Revival churches.

Of particular interest are the stained glass windows, which are attributed to the prominent London glassmakers Clayton and Bell. A keen eye will also be drawn to the circa 1862 Caen stone font, which was gifted for the baptism of the prince of Hawaii by the widow of Arctic explorer Sir John Franklin.

4200,4762,Visiting an Old Church Only to Find the Doors Closed,"Visiting an old church outside of regular worship services can sometimes be impossible one traveler found.

Dennis Lennox

Visiting an old church outside of regular worship services can sometimes be impossible.

If you thought the last visitor to have trouble would be the bishop then you thought wrong. It turns out that even prelates are turned away from historic churches and cathedrals.

Expand | Collapse The Roman Catholic bishop of Portsmouth says every church he tried to visit was closed.

Just ask the Right Rev. Philip Egan, the Roman Catholic bishop of Portsmouth in England.

Egan is in the news for taking to Twitter and complaining that every church he attempted to visit recently was locked up.

While not ideal many churches keep their doors closed outside of Sunday morning.

Some cite financial reasons, saying they can't afford to have staff on-duty. Others believe the risk of theft or vandalism — many of the oldest churches contain religious art worthy of museums — is too high to leave the doors open.

Regardless of the reason, many of these closed churches will at least post a notice informing those wishing to visit where they can find a keyholder.

That may seem ideal, but experts warn a locked church has a higher risk.

Ecclesiastical, the largest insurer of Church of England congregations, tells policyholders that criminals are deterred by an open church because of the possibility that anyone can stop by and visit. Meanwhile, the Roman Catholic insurer, Catholic National Mutual Limited, advises than open church doesn't increase insurance premiums.

The best advice for church crawlers is to confirm opening hours by telephone or email before showing up.

Yes, many churches list hours on their website, but sometimes things come up that force an otherwise open church to close.

And don't be afraid to ask a nearby neighbor if you do show up and find the doors locked and no keyholder notice posted.

The chances are, at least in a small English village, that someone will know someone with a key.

4201,4763,Does Trump Get a Moral Mulligan?,"(Photo: Reuters) U.S. President Donald Trump.

There is a firestorm of controversy over the comments of evangelical leader Tony Perkins that President Trump gets a ""mulligan"" for his past sexual indiscretions, as headline after headline reports on this apparently outrageous statement. To quote Perkins directly from his interview with Erin Burnett on CNN, ""Yes, evangelicals, conservatives, they gave him a mulligan. They let him have a do-over. They said we'll start afresh with you and we'll give you a second chance.""

On the one hand, I can understand the outrage. We evangelicals didn't give Bill Clinton a mulligan, and we're certainly not giving Harvey Weinstein a mulligan. And since we claim to be champions of marital fidelity and sexual purity, we could not have picked a worst poster boy for our cause – at least that is what we're told.

As Michael Gerson wrote in the Washington Post, ""The Trump evangelicals have lost their gag reflex."" Yes, we evangelicals have made our ""political bargain with open eyes.""

Trump, Gerson argues, ""has made profanity an unavoidable part of our political culture. He is in the midst of a gathering corruption scandal that has left close aides under indictment. He tells repeated and obvious lies. He incites ethnic and racial resentment as a political strategy and was caught on tape bragging about sexual assault. Add to this something that could never be said of Nixon: the credible accusation that Trump paid hush money to a porn star to cover up an affair.""

And how does Franklin Graham respond to this? ""We certainly don't hold him up as the pastor of this nation and he is not. But I appreciate the fact that the president does have a concern for Christian values, he does have a concern to protect Christians whether it's here at home or around the world, and I appreciate the fact that he protects religious liberty and freedom.""

For Gerson and others, this is the height of hypocrisy, and there is no excuse for the fact that, in his words, Trump evangelicals have become ""sycophants, cheerleaders and enablers.""

From my perspective, to the extent we have minimized Trump's past transgressions or turned him into a modern-day saint, there is some truth to these allegations. We have lost our moral compass.

But that is only one side of the story, and this is what many people find impossible to grasp: We voted for Donald Trump with our eyes wide open and without compromising our faith.

If he did, in fact, have a fling with this porn star (which he denies) and pay to keep her quiet, we would not be surprised. And when he does use profanity (as many other presidents did before him), we are not surprised. And when he's caught in a lie, we are not surprised. Grieved, yes; surprised, no.

We don't overlook his past transgressions, we don't hail him as the exemplar of marital fidelity, and we don't say to our constituents, ""Follow Trump, as he follows Christ"" (to echo Paul's words in 1 Corinthians 11:1).

Rather, we say this: Babies are being slaughtered by Planned Parenthood, and this flawed man is willing to help us stop the slaughter. Christians are being massacred by ISIS, and this flawed man is willing to help stop the bloodshed. Our religious liberties are being threatened, and this flawed man is willing to take a stand on our behalf.

So, we appreciate him, we support him in carrying out his campaign promises, and as best as we can, behind closed doors and in other settings, we encourage him to step higher and to take the claims of Jesus seriously.

How is that hypocritical? How is that immoral? How is that compromised?

We weren't impressed when he held up his family Bible during the campaign, and we weren't surprised when he couldn't quote a single verse from memory. We know the man we voted for.

And he knows who he is too, saying in his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, ""At this moment, I would like to thank the evangelical community because, I will tell you what, the support they have given me — and I'm not sure I totally deserve it — has been so amazing. And has been such a big reason I'm here tonight. They have much to contribute to our policies.""

A political insider even told me that, during the campaign, when he asked Trump to take a strong stand on a marriage-related issue, he said, ""I can't do that, given my history.""

I can't confirm this firsthand (although my source says he heard it for himself), but I can confirm that I've never heard Trump put himself forward as a paragon of marital virtue, which would make sense.

As for giving him a mulligan, that's what you call the gospel. God forgives us, and we forgive others, especially if they recognize their guilt and seek to make positive changes.

To this very moment, I feel confident that if Bill Clinton came forward and confessed to his past adulteries, taking full responsibility, seeking to make restitution, and asking for forgiveness, we would line up to be the first to forgive publicly. And should he then say, ""I've had a change of heart regarding abortion,"" we would welcome him as a colleague on the front lines of the pro-life movement.

In certain ways, Trump has presented more of a mixed bag in that he continues to engage in unchristian behavior while, at the same time, making a clear break with his past. Yet he has consistently welcomed evangelical Christians into his life, he has listened attentively when they have spoken to him, and, to my knowledge, he has never rebuffed their calls for him to change.

So, while he remains a work in progress, he continues to champion many important causes, and with all his blemishes, he is our president.

Do we not, then, grant him a mulligan when it comes to his past? And if we were to learn that he committed adultery 50 times in his former life, would this change our view of him today?

To repeat: We voted for him with our eyes wide open (at least, most of us did), and we can support him, with the necessary caveats, without denying or compromising our faith.

What's so scandalous about that?

4202,4764,Every Year We Abort 1.5 Million Babies While Over 3 Million Families Are in Line to Adopt,"(Photo: Reuters/James Lawler Duggan)

Learning that my husband and I were infertile was devastating. After struggling with this reality for eight years we felt like our dreams of having children were shattered. We turned to adoption, thinking it would be a quick and easy solution. What we discovered was that it was time-consuming with a lot of paperwork and hoops to jump through. After all that we had to wait to be selected by a birth mom.

We persevered, and our lives changed forever after adopting two children at birth. They are our joy and their birth moms are the very definition of courage.

When faced with unexpected and difficult life situations, they each made the selfless choice to carry their babies to term and place them for adoption. There can be profound feelings of loss for mothers who make that hard choice, so it's hard to fully express the deep gratitude and humility I carry as an adoptive parent. Our children's birth mothers made that hard choice, and now we have the incredible responsibility and joy of raising two precious kids.

Yet, too many expecting mothers make a different choice. Despite the rapid change in public opinion related to abortion largely influenced by modern science, in the United States alone we still abort 1.2 million babies annually. At the same time, there are four to five million couples waiting to adopt a baby. In fact, statistics tell us that for every baby placed for adoption there are 36 couples waiting for their turn to adopt. Think about that: we could literally adopt every single baby destined to be aborted in 2018.

I wonder how many women wrestling with the decision to abort might choose life if they knew there was already a home awaiting their baby even before it was born?

As a Christian, I believe that a person's value is not determined by ethnicity, race, gender, age, ability, citizenship, or any other identifying factor. Our dignity is not based on our abilities, whether we are able to care for ourselves or our competence to perform tasks.

Instead, a person's value is based on being made in the likeness of God; it is a divine and irrevocable membership in the human family. All men, women and children (including preborn children in the womb) should be respected, regardless of their mental capacity, physical ability or social position.

No matter what we do or say, our human dignity should not be forfeited or diminished.

That's why I'm marching in the 45th annual March for Life in Washington D.C., joining thousands of others who care deeply about the sanctity of life. As an adoptive parent, I feel an obligation to do my part to advocate for life. My heart longs for our culture to value life from birth to death.

Being pro-life means so much more than defending unborn children. It means a commitment to caring for people through every season of life. For example, there are thousands of children in the foster care system whose lives could be drastically changed by adoption. We also have a duty to make sure our elderly receive the intentional care and support they need to feel comfortable and loved as they face end of life issues.

For my husband and me, adopting two children has been a remarkable journey filled with ups and downs, one we've been so glad to have made. My prayer is that no woman would feel her only option is to abort her baby, but that she would know there's a home already waiting for her child.

4203,4765,People Are Killing Themsleves In Record Numbers: Why and What Can We Do?,"An internet-video star explored a forest in Japan where people go to hang themselves. And he showed (at least partially) one such deceased man. What is going on?

Expand | Collapse Dr. Jerry Newcombe is a key archivist of the D. James Kennedy Legacy Library, a spokesman and cohost of Kennedy Classics.

Suicide has been in the news lately. An internet-video star explored a forest in Japan where people go to hang themselves. And he showed (at least partially) one such deceased man. This video caused understandable backlash.

Also there's the news about a designer that promoted a fashion belt using a photo of a model with the belt around her neck (with the word ""hanger"" on her shirt)---seeming to suggest suicide. This caused such an uproar that the advertiser has taken down the images.

Finally, Olympic swimming champion (winner of 28 medals) Michael Phelps admitted that he had contemplated suicide and is now extremely grateful he did not pursue it.

Mental health treatment for Phelps' depression helped, and today he helps others by sharing his story. He says he cherishes helping others come out of depression more ""than winning the Olympic gold medal."" Phelps concludes: ""I am extremely thankful that I did not take my life.""

All this gets me to thinking about the subject of taking one's life. Suicide, of course, is not new. One man said, ""Just as I choose a ship to sail in or a house to live in, so I choose a death for my passage from life."" That was from Seneca, who lived from 4 BC-AD 65.

The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) says on its website (nimh.nih.gov): ""Over 40,000 people die by suicide each year in the United States; it is the 10th leading cause of death overall. Suicide is complicated and tragic but it is often preventable.""

Look for the potential warning signs of those you know. The NIMH lists the following as potential ""signs that someone is thinking about suicide,"" including:

•Talking about wanting to die or wanting to kill themselves

•Talking about feeling empty, hopeless, or having no reason to live

•Using alcohol or drugs more often

•Acting anxious or agitated

•Withdrawing from family and friends

•Giving away important possessions

•Saying goodbye to friends and family

•Putting affairs in order, making a will.""

The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention encourages those contemplating suicide to instead call 1-800-273-TALK.

The Bible, far from advocating suicide, only shows it as a wicked act. There are five examples of suicide in the Scripture, of course, that of Judas Iscariot being the most prominent. That is not to say that all who fall prey to an act of depressed desperation are wicked; but it is to say that suicide is considered a wicked act.

In our book, What If Jesus Had Never Been Born?, D. James Kennedy and I wrote: ""Christianity has long been a foe of suicide, in the ancient world and now in the modern world. Today the neo-pagan view is cheapening the value of human life all over again. In recent years, one of the nation's best-selling books was a how-to manual on suicide.""

I knew someone personally who was going to commit suicide. He happened to go into his boss's office at 7:00 in the morning. The lights were off, which usually meant the boss wasn't there. Then my friend went to the window and started to open it---in order to jump out and plunge to his death several stories below.

Suddenly, out of the blue, he heard a voice, saying, ""Smith, what are you doing?"" Smith claimed he was just trying to open the window to get some fresh air---in his boss's office 90 minutes before work? That young man later went on to become a Christian and was exceedingly grateful that he had not succeeded in his suicide attempt. So are those of us who knew him.

Our lives are not our own. Therefore, they are not our own to take. I realize sometimes people lose their minds and end up killing themselves. Meanwhile, anyone of sound mind who willfully takes his life should be aware the spiritual consequences.

I remember one time at a Christian radio station I received a call from a listener who was distraught. His wife had left him, and he wanted to end it all. He asked me if he, as a Christian, would still go to heaven even if he killed himself. I told him that it would be awful to find out the hard way that he wouldn't. He called me a few months later, very happy he had not killed himself---and that his wife had come back to him.

Sometimes we can go through difficult periods. Perhaps they are times of testing. But to paraphrase C. S. Lewis: ""Never doubt in the dark what the Lord has shown you in the light.""

Life is a gift from God. As one elderly lady who was in very bad health put it: ""Only He who gave us life has the right to take life.""

4204,4766,Why Would a Bible Translation Use the Word 'Palestine'?,"Why would the NASB introduce the word ""Palestine"" when ""Palestine"" did not exist at that time? Those responsible for the NASB need to fix the error.

Expand | Collapse Michael Brown holds a Ph.D. in Near Eastern Languages and Literatures from New York University. He is the author of 25 books and hosts the nationally syndicated, daily talk radio show, the Line of Fire.

The NASB is one of the most widely used modern translations of the Bible, and there is not the slightest hint that the translation is anti-Israel, let alone anti-Semitic. So, my question comes by way of interest and curiosity, not by way of indictment or accusation. Why would this fine translation introduce the word ""Palestine"" in its section headings? This would be similar to a history book carrying the caption, ""Christopher Columbus discovers the United States."" Or, ""The rule of Genghis Khan extends into the Soviet Union."" Or, ""T. E. Lawrence was famously known as 'Lawrence of Saudi Arabia.'""

All of these would be grossly anachronistic.

Yet none of my examples are as anachronistic as what is consistently found in various editions of the NASB, including print editions (the one in front of me is printed by Cambridge University Press) and various digital versions (for example, on Bible Gateway, Bible Hub, and the Laridian PocketBible, which is found in the Logos app).

As a colleague (and long-time reader of the NASB) pointed out to me today, in several places in the translation, ""Palestine"" is introduced in the section headings.

And so, the print edition carries this section heading before Joshua 10:29: ""Joshua's Conquest of Southern Palestine."" Similarly, each of the digital versions I mentioned carries this heading before Joshua 11:1: ""Northern Palestine Taken.""

In contrast, other modern Bible translations have this heading before Joshua 11:1 on the Bible Gateway website: ""Joshua's Conquest of the North"" (Lexham); ""Conquests in Northern Canaan"" (ESV); ""Israel Defeats a Northern Coalition"" (NET); ""The Northern Campaign"" (ISV); ""Conquest of Northern Cities"" (CSB); ""The Northern Conquest"" (NKJV); ""Northern Kings Defeated"" (MEV); ""Conquering the North"" (TLV).

Only the NASB mentions Palestine.

The problem, of course, is that ""Palestine"" did not exist at that time, and if a place name was needed, then ""Canaan"" would have sufficed (as per the ESV).

And while it's true that these section headings are not part of the Bible translation proper (I've been involved in a few translation projects, and our focus is always on the actual biblical text), it's also true that they can become as fixed as the translation itself, hence the appearance of ""Palestine"" in both print and digital editions of the NASB.

Again, I'm not implying anything sinister, since the NASB renders one key passage in a way that I would say is not only accurate but also refuted a supersessionist interpretation. (By ""supersessionist"" I refer a wrong interpretation in which the Church is seen as spiritual Israel and in which there are no national promises for physical Israel. Thus the Church supersedes Israel.)

Specifically, the NASB translators (along with most other modern translators) recognized that Paul was not addressing Gentile believers in Galatia as ""the Israel of God"" (see Galatians 6:16; contrast the NIV), as if these Gentile Christians had become the new Israel and had displaced the old Israel. (Here, in this verse, ""the Israel of God"" refers most likely to Jewish believers in Jesus, called Messianic Jews today.) Had there been an anti-Israel bias, it would likely have been reflected here.

So, at the risk of being redundant, I'm bringing no accusation against this popular translation, nor am I assuming that the translators themselves all agreed on the section headings.

I am simply wondering out loud why they used the completely wrong term ""Palestine"" in these section headings, since ""Palestine"" did not even exist as a name for this part of the world until roughly 1,500 years after the time of Joshua's conquest. Talk about being anachronistic.

But not only so, the origins of the name Palestine are totally negative. That's why Tsafrir Ronen posted an article titled, ""The Invention of Palestine as a Psychological Weapon for Conquering Eretz Yisrael [the Land of Israel]"" on the Think Israel website.

As Ronen explains, ""Almost 2,000 years ago, the Roman Emperor Hadrian cursed the Jewish People and decreed that Judea should be henceforth called 'Palestine' after the Philistines, an ancient enemy of Israel that had disappeared from the world's stage more than 600 years earlier. It was his final twist of the knife and legacy after wars, massacres, persecutions, and exiles that had largely extinguished the Jewish presence from Judea.""

Or, as another website states, ""The Roman emperor Hadrian, in an effort to destroy Jews once and for all, renamed the territory of Judea (the present-day West Bank), Palaestina, after the Philistines, an Aegean people who had conquered the coast of Canaan. They appear in the Old Testament as depraved pagans and have long since vanished from history.

""Hadrian's intention was to eradicate memory of the Jewish people whom the Romans exiled from their homeland as punishment for having rebelled against them in 130 AD.""

It is true that the Jewish people reclaimed the word ""Palestinian"" for themselves earlier last century, and so, the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra was originally the Palestine Symphony Orchestra (founded in 1936), while the original name for the Jerusalem Post was the Palestine Post (founded in 1932).

Ironically, this underscores the fact that the Arabs and others living in Palestine before 1948 did not think of themselves as Palestinians. This was never part of their corporate or individual identity until after 1967. (See here for example; as Ronen noted, ""Today, the modern enemies of a resurrected Jewish Nation have dusted off Hadrian's curse and are attempting to pull off a monumental theft: the Arab world have reincarnated 'Palestine' to steal Israel's heritage and the Land of the Jewish People."")

But, when it comes to Bible history, especially Old Testament history, there is no such entity known as ""Palestine,"" and there is absolutely no justification for its presence in the section headings of the NASB (or, any other Bible for that matter) when talking about biblical events.

It's one thing to talk about Mark Twain visiting Palestine in the 1800's (when it was actually known by that name). It's another thing to talk about Joshua conquering Palestine.

To do so is to agree with the anti-Israel talking points of Palestinian activists, who also claim that the ancient Israelites engaged in the ethnic cleansing of Palestine (those evil Israelis are doing it again today!) and that Jesus was ""a Palestinian messenger.""

I look forward to the those currently responsible for the NASB rectifying this error.

Update: I have been informed that the 2019 revision of the NASB already planned to replace ""Palestine"" with ""Canaan"" in these section headings.

We all need to pray.

Pastors specifically need prayer. The enemy will do whatever he can to destroy the ministry of your pastors. Will you consider praying for your pastors in these specific areas?

Pray for wisdom for your pastor. These leaders are often confronted with incredibly challenging situations and decisions. They need God's wisdom to continue to be the leader of the church God has called them to be. Pray for your pastor's protection. Your pastor will be attacked in so many different ways. Your pastor will be tempted again and again. The enemy seeks to destroy. The Enemy wants your pastor's ministry destroyed. Pray for your pastor's family. They too are attacked, criticized, and sometimes bullied. They often feel isolated and alone. They need encouragement. They need prayer. Pray for your pastor to withstand the critics and bullies. Some of the critics and bullies are overt and aggressive. Others are passive aggressive. All are painful. And every pastor has them. Pray against discouragement from comparison. Before this week is over, a church member will likely tell your pastor to listen to a podcast by another pastor ""to learn how to really preach"" (actual words spoken to a pastor). Other pastors will hear numerous comments about the other great church in the community. The message is real and painful: You don't measure up, pastor. Pray against discouragement from members leaving. It's hard for your pastor not to take it personally. It's really hard when the departing member tells your pastor to take it personally. Pray against discouragement from decline. Two out of three congregations in North America are declining. That is a painful reality for your pastor. That is a discouraging reality for your pastor. Pray against discouragement from disunity. ""I wish I had every minute back I had to spend refereeing church members."" Those are the actual words of one of the Church Answers' pastors I serve. The enemy loves it when church members fight one another. Pray for discernment for ""yes"" and ""no."" Pastors are pulled in a multitude of directions. They are expected to be in so many meetings, so many social events, and so many pastoral situations. They are really expected to be omnipresent. Pray they will be able to say ""no"" more often. Pray for their families who often get the scanty leftovers of the pastor's time. Pray for financial pressures. Many pastors are underpaid. They struggle day by day with financial challenges. Actual quote from a deacon: ""I like for our pastor to be underpaid. It keeps him humble and dependent on God."" That deacon is enjoying a life of leisure from inherited wealth. Pray for gospel opportunities. Pastors are energized when they have the opportunity to share the gospel. Unfortunately, many of them are too busy to take time to do so. The demands of the church are just too great. These pastors live lives of inverted priorities and frustrating days.

Do we really want healthy churches? Do we really want to defeat the enemy in these battles?

Pray for your pastor.

Start today. Take five minutes of each day to pray for your pastor.

It may be the greatest contribution you can make to your church.

4206,4768,A Turning Point for Religious Freedom and the Medical Profession,"(Photo: REUTERS/Mike Blake) An emergency sign points to the entrance to Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, California, U.S. March 23, 2017.

For healthcare providers facing restrictions on their rights of conscience, reinforcements are on the way.On January 18th, the Trump Administration announced the creation of the Conscience and Religious Freedom Division of Health and Human Services.

According to Roger Severino, the head of the Civil Rights Office at HHS, the division's purpose is to protect doctors, nurses, and other health care providers ""from being coerced into participating in activities that violate their consciences, such as abortion, sterilization, or assisted suicide.""

This is very good news. Not only does it further the cause of religious freedom, but it recognizes that religious freedom is more than just the right to believe what we want in the privacy of our heads, homes and houses of worship. Instead it's the right to orient our lives, including our public lives, around those beliefs. And it also shines a much-needed light on what is a frontline in the battle to protect freedom of conscience and religion: hospitals and doctors' offices.

As Severino put it, ""America's doctors and nurses are dedicated to saving lives and should not be bullied out of the practice of medicine simply because they object to performing abortions against their conscience . . .""

Last week, his office released a 216-page proposed regulation entitled ""Protecting Statutory Conscience Rights in Health Care.""

Now predictably, critics jumped on the announcement. Lambda Legal said that the Division and the proposed rule ""[weaponizes] HHS's Office of Civil Rights against [the LGBT community].""

If you're wondering what on earth they're talking about, you're not alone. Somehow, a proposal about abortion and physician-assisted suicide is actually about the LGBT community?

The proposed rule mentions ""abortion"" 155 times and ""suicide"" 29 times. We know because we counted. Now how many time does it use ""LGBT,"" or ""transgender,"" or any related term? Zero.

Someone whose response to the announcement made sense was the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. They expressed gratitude to HHS for ""taking seriously its charge to protect these fundamental civil rights."" ""For too long,"" they said, ""we have seen medical professionals, including pro-life nurses like Cathy DeCarlo, who have been coerced by their employers into participating in abortion."" DeCarlo, a nurse at New York's Mt. Sinai Hospital, was threatened with disciplinary action ""in May 2009 if she did not honor a last-minute summons to assist in a scheduled late-term abortion.""

This was despite the fact that, one, DeCarlo's objection to abortion was on record, and two, there was no medical emergency involved. The Alliance Defending Freedom, representing DeCarlo, asked HHS to investigate, and it did. The result was a change in the policy at the hospital. Unfortunately, by then the damage to DeCarlo's religious freedom had already been done.

There are more than 600 Catholic hospitals in the United States, which provide one in six of the nation's hospital beds. Many view this as a terrible thing precisely because these institutions, not to mention the Protestant ones, will not go along with John Paul II called ""the culture of death.""

The Manhattan Declaration specifically cited ""the effort to compel pro-life institutions (including religiously affiliated hospitals and clinics), and pro-life physicians, surgeons, nurses, and other health care professionals, to refer for abortions and, in certain cases, even to perform or participate in abortions.""

If people can be compelled to participate in the taking of innocent human life, there's no limit to what can be done to violate the conscience.

I'm grateful for the Administration's and Severino's commitment to protecting this religious freedom of health care workers. In doing so, they've taken an important step in protecting ours, as well.

4232,4800,John Piper Gets It All Wrong About Women In Ministry,"(Screenshot: YouTube/Desiring God)

""If it is unbiblical to have women as pastors, how can it be biblical to have women who function in formal teaching and mentoring capacities...""

Here we go again. Theologian John Piper stirred up a hornet's nest by arguing women are not to teach men. Piper points to 1 Timothy 2:12 that churches should be led by a team of spiritual, humble, biblically qualified men.

""If it is unbiblical to have women as pastors, how can it be biblical to have women who function in formal teaching and mentoring capacities to train and fit pastors for the very calling from which the mentors themselves are excluded?"" Piper writes.

Yes, 1 Timothy 2:12-13 says women should not teach or assume authority over a man. Others point to 1 Timothy 3, which lists the qualifications for bishops and deacons as reasons not to allow women in ministry. But what do we do, then, with Deborah, a prophetess and a judge who led Israel into victorious battle when a man would not take charge? What about Anna the prophetess? What about Priscilla, who traveled in ministry with her husband?

Look at Aimee Semple McPherson. What about Kathryn Kuhlman? How about Marilyn Hickey and Joyce Meyer? All of these women have been a blessing to the body of Christ, and they have all faced persecution from people who don't agree that they should speak and teach. Jesus certainly didn't prevent women from entering ministry so I am unsure as to why there is so much resistance in some camps within the modern church.

I would like to end the heated debate over women in ministry. There are too many examples in Scripture of women serving in leadership or other key roles for men to deny women a seat at the leadership table. That said, I'm not calling for affirmative action here. Church roles should be assigned by the Holy Spirit. That means leadership needs to pray and fast without preconceived notions—and without bias toward women—before they appoint people to positions.

Paul wrote, ""But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to everyone for the common good. To one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit, to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healings by the same Spirit, to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, and to another the interpretation of tongues. But that one and very same Spirit works all these, dividing to each one individually as He will"" (1 Cor. 12:7-11).

Paul didn't say women can't operate in spiritual gifts and I don't believe Paul intended for women to be denied opportunities to serve in various ministries, even leadership positions, within the church. I think locking women out of ministry can actually work against God at times. God is the one who calls people into ministry—men and women. If we were all obedient to the Holy Spirit in this matter, there would be much less strife and much more effectiveness in ministry for the glory of God.

It's going to take all of us laboring together to turn around our nation. Can we quit attacking women who are trying to do what God has called them to do?
